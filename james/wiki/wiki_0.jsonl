It holds that Canada 's culture , political history and economy have been decisively shaped by the exploitation and export of a series of \" staples \" such as fur , fish , wood , wheat , mined metals and fossil fuels . Innis theorized that this reliance on exporting natural resources made Canada dependent on more industrially advanced countries and resulted in periodic disruptions to economic life as the international demand for staples rose and fell ; as the staple itself became increasingly scarce ; and , as technological change resulted in shifts from one staple to others . Innis pointed out , for example , that as furs became scarce and trade in that staple declined , it became necessary to develop and export other staples such as wheat , potash and especially lumber . The export of these new staples was made possible through improved transportation networks that included first canals , and later , railways .", "token_len": 191}

The content of the letters was <unk> claimed by Massachusetts radical politicians to call for the abridgement of colonial rights , and a duel was fought in England over the matter .  The affair served to inflame tensions in Massachusetts , where implementation of the 1773 Tea Act was met with resistance that culminated in the Boston Tea Party in December 1773 .

Hutchinson complained that Adams and the opposition were misrepresenting what he had written , and that nothing he had written in them on the subject of Parliamentary supremacy went beyond other statements he had made .

{"text": "Social identity theory states that social behavior will vary along a continuum between interpersonal behavior and intergroup behaviour . Completely interpersonal behaviour would be behaviour determined solely by the individual characteristics and interpersonal relationships that exists between two or more people . Completely intergroup behaviour would be behaviour determined solely by the social category memberships that apply to two or more people .  The authors of social identity theory state that purely interpersonal or purely intergroup behaviour is unlikely to be found in realistic social situations . Rather , behaviour is expected to be driven by a compromise between the two extremes . The cognitive nature of personal vs. social identities , and the relationship between them , is more fully developed in self @-@ categorization theory .

It should be noted that the precise nature of this strive for positive self @-@ concept is a matter of debate ( see the self @-@ esteem hypothesis ) .  Both the interpersonal @-@ intergroup continuum and the assumption of positive distinctiveness motivation arose as outcomes of the findings of minimal group studies .

In contrast to the previous two centuries , England was relatively secure from invasion .

English economic thinking remained conservative , seeing the economy as consisting of three groups : the ordines , those who fought , or the nobility ; <unk> , those who worked , in particular the peasantry ; and <unk> , those who prayed , or the clerics .

Scholars infer from this that the editors of the volume , John Heminges and Henry Condell , included the directions to aid readers , and they were not necessarily Shakespeare 's . Scholars have also wondered about the masque in Act 4 , which some think was an interpolated afterthought , possibly added for the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Frederick V in 1613 .

There is no further public performance recorded prior to the Restoration ; but in his 1669 preface to the Dryden / Davenant version , John Dryden states that The Tempest had been performed at the Blackfriars Theatre .

{"text": "There are several situations that can affect the accuracy of the pitot @-@ static instruments .

{"text": "A blocked pitot tube is a pitot @-@ static problem that will only affect airspeed indicators . A blocked pitot tube will cause the airspeed indicator to register an increase in airspeed when the aircraft climbs , even though actual airspeed is constant . This is caused by the pressure in the pitot system remaining constant when the atmospheric pressure ( and static pressure ) are decreasing . In reverse , the airspeed indicator will show a decrease in airspeed when the aircraft descends . The pitot tube is susceptible to becoming clogged by ice , water , insects or some other obstruction . For this reason , aviation regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) recommend that the pitot tube be checked for obstructions prior to any flight . To prevent icing , many pitot tubes are equipped with a heating element . A heated pitot tube is required in all aircraft certificated for instrument flight except aircraft certificated as Experimental Amateur @-@ Built .", "token_len": 197}
{"text": "A blocked static port is a more serious situation because it affects all pitot @-@ static instruments . One of the most common causes of a blocked static port is airframe icing . A blocked static port will cause the altimeter to freeze at a constant value , the altitude at which the static port became blocked . The vertical speed indicator will become frozen at zero and will not change at all , even if vertical speed increases or decreases . The airspeed indicator will reverse the error that occurs with a clogged pitot tube and cause the airspeed to be read less than it actually is as the aircraft climbs . When the aircraft is descending , the airspeed will be over @-@ reported . In most aircraft with unpressurized cabins , an alternative static source is available and can be selected from within the cockpit .", "token_len": 164}
{"text": "Another class of inherent errors is that of position error . A position error is produced by the aircraft 's static pressure being different from the air pressure remote from the aircraft . This error is caused by the air flowing past the static port at a speed different from the aircraft 's true airspeed . Position errors may provide positive or negative errors , depending on one of several factors . These factors include airspeed , angle of attack , aircraft weight , acceleration , aircraft configuration , and in the case of helicopters , rotor downwash . There are two categories of position errors , which are \" fixed errors \" and \" variable errors \" . Fixed errors are defined as errors which are specific to a particular model of aircraft . Variable errors are caused by external factors such as deformed panels obstructing the flow of air , or particular situations which may <unk> the aircraft .", "token_len": 170}
{"text": "Lag errors are caused by the fact that any changes in the static or dynamic pressure outside the aircraft require a finite amount of time to make their way down the tubing and affect the gauges .
