{"text": "`` Examinations of Time Dilation Effects on Inter-species Communication After Universal Cataclysm '' \n Journal of Archaeonebula Exploration \n Issue XXIV , April 2153 \n \n \n Abstract : After the success of the Iranian-European Union Venture Program , probes were transferred to the Delta Quadrant of Alpha Centauri . Over five galactic-standard years , moon-like planetoids and Earth surrogates were examined for evidence of the source of beta-frequency decay signals . The signals translated during the 2087 Earth year of space 'renaissance ' confirmed the presence of intelligent life in the universe . While seeking first contact , errors occurred in communication between the probes and the International Communication Outpost - Mars ( ICOM ) , time dilation effects warped the signals . The popular moniker `` Milky Way '' has been shown to be ironically accurate . Our galactic glaucoma has prevented us from learning of the extinction of all intelligent life in the universe .\n", "token_len": 196}

Smell can be thought of as Taste at a distance , while Sight and Hearing can be thought of as Touch at a distance .
