If at least one of the two guesses is correct, they will live another day.

Ten fathers were videotaped and gave salivary testosterone samples while interacting with their 2–4 months old infants, and viewed video clips of their own infant and an unfamiliar age-, ethnicity- and sex-matched other infant during an fMRI protocol. Infant stimuli activated a network of prefrontal and subcortical brain regions. Furthermore, a subset of these regions activated significantly more to own (OWN) than other (OTHER) infants. Finally, neural responses to OWN versus OTHER were linked with paternal sensitivity, paternal reciprocity, and testosterone. In sum, our results provide a novel perspective on the links between brain, behavior, and hormones in fathers."}

But the test was a failure, according to American and South Korean defense officials.\n\nThe Pentagon confirmed, somewhat indirectly, that the test involved a ballistic missile when it called the launch a violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions that explicitly prohibit North Korea from using or testing ballistic missile technology.\n\nThe Defense Department said that its surveillance and radar systems \"detected and tracked\" the launch. It added that \"the missile launched from North Korea did not pose a threat to North America.\"\n\nThe test occurred while Defense Secretary Ashton B.

{"text": "Abstract\n\nTwo studies investigated the predictive ability of romantic relationship quality in happiness above and beyond the influence of personality (Big Five) among emerging adults. Study 1 (n = 221) showed that global romantic relationship quality accounted for 3% of the variance in happiness while controlling for personality. Study 2 (n = 187) replicated this finding by assessing happiness and relationship quality with different scales. Second study also extended the first study in two ways. First, emotional security and companionship emerged as the strongest features of romantic relationship quality that predicted happiness. Second, identity formation moderated the relationship between relationship quality and happiness such that emerging adults were happier when they experienced high quality relationships at high levels of identity formation. Findings across the two studies were discussed in the light of the literature and suggestions for future research were made."}

{"text": "Review:\n\nJapanese producer Goth Trad is an interesting character. Some years ago, he single-handedly tried to introduce a form of music called \"mad rave\" - an intense and really quite insane fusion of D&B, hardcore, break core and dubstep. There are occasional echoes of that period on New Epoch - his first full-length for bass music hipsters Deep Medi - but for the most part it's a fairly careful and considered set. Mostly built around variants of dubstep rhythms, it fuses chiming melodies and clanking industrial sounds with hand-picked samples, skittering percussion and subdued, sub-shaking grooves. In parts, it has more in common with IDM than hardcore, but that's no bad thing. It's certainly his most grown-up album to date - highly recommended."}

{"text": "We consider how valid conclusions often lay hidden within research reports, masked by plausible but unjustified conclusions reached in those reports. We employ several well-known and cross-cutting examples from the psychological literature to illustrate how, independent (or in the absence) of replicability difficulties or questionable research practices leading to false positives, motivated reasoning and confirmation biases can lead to drawing unjustified conclusions. In describing these examples, we review strategies and methods by which researchers can identify such practices in their own and others' research reports. These strategies and methods can unmask hidden phenomena that may conflict with researchers' preferred narratives, in order to ultimately produce more sound and valid scientific conclusions. We conclude with general recommendations for how social psychologists can limit the influence of interpretive biases in their own and others' research, and thereby elevate the scientific status and validity of social psychology."}

It examines what it takes, and what it means, for coffee to be defined as \"specialty.\" The film whisks audiences on a trip around the world, from farms in Honduras and Rwanda to coffee shops in Tokyo, Portland, Seattle, San Francisco and New York. Through the eyes and experiences of farmers and baristas, the film offers a unique overview of all the elements—the processes, preferences and preparations; traditions old and new—that come together to create the best cups. This is a film that bridges gaps both intellectual and geographical, evoking flavor and pleasure, and providing both as well.\n\nNo matter the quality of your cup, people who love coffee, love it.

{"text": "Gendered Student Ideals in STEM in Higher Education\n\nLaura Parson and C. Casey Ozaki\n\nUsing the framework of feminist standpoint theory, this study explored the everyday work of undergraduate STEM students to identify STEM institutional cultural norms and standards that organize and inform the organization of work for undergraduate women majoring in math and physics. Data collection and analysis focused on how the interface between undergraduate women and STEM education was organized as a matter of everyday encounters between students, faculty, and administration through their experiences inside and outside the classroom. Undergraduate participants reported challenges meeting some of the characteristics of successful math and physics students (e.g., taking risks, asking questions, putting school first) and preferred a collectivistic environment. These characteristics are evidence of a masculine STEM institution, which also creates a masculine ideal that women students are expected to meet and exacerbates their discomfort in the STEM environment."}

That meant that your boss could legally fire you for taking time off to care for your kids, yourself or a sick relative.\n\nThe impetus for the law came after the formal recognition that \"t he lack of employment policies to accommodate working parents can force individuals to choose between job security and parenting,\" and that \" due to the nature of the roles of men and women in our society, the primary responsibility for family caretaking often falls on women.\"\n\nThe law ensures 12 weeks of unpaid leave for all U.S. workers for every 12-month period to care for themselves or a loved one.

{"text": "Side effects of combined oral contraceptives are the most common reason why women discontinue them. Over the past half century, an elaborate mythology about these ill effects has evolved, fueled by rumor, gossip and poor-quality research. In contrast, placebo-controlled randomized trials document that nonspecific side effects are not significantly more common with combined oral contraceptives than with inert pills. These reported nonspecific side effects may reflect the nocebo phenomenon (the inverse of a placebo): if women are told to expect noxious side effects, these complaints occur because of the power of suggestion. Alternatively, nonspecific complaints may simply reflect their background prevalence in the population. Because Level I evidence documents no important increase in nonspecific side effects with oral contraceptives, counseling about these side effects or including them in package labeling is unwarranted and probably unethical. When in doubt, clinicians should err on the side of optimism."}

Historians disagree on fundamental issues, such as dates and facts, as well as interpretation. Most argue that the effects of the wars were not as widespread as once thought, and some see the traditional view of the era as merely Tudor propaganda.

Unlike the 'K' model processors, the i5-3470 doesn't have an unlocked multiplier, so the max overclocked frequency is not much beyond its stock frequency. The i5-3470 features integrated Intel HD Graphics 2500 which are relatively weak by modern standards, so to enjoy a good 3D gaming experience a GPU upgrade is necessary. Whilst the 3470 is a reasonable CPU, it's only fractionally cheaper than the i5-3570K which scores an effective speed of 98 and has an unlocked multiplier. Overall the 3470 is somewhat dated and there is far better value available in today's market. [Nov '14 CPUPro]"}

{"text": "Finally, an aspect that needs comment is the reaction to injection of rocuronium. The authors state that injection of intramuscular rocuronium \"…elicited vigorous movement (e.g., extremity movement against gravity) in 50% of patients…\" and attributed this to light anesthesia. One would expect less reaction to pain only from a minor stimulus such as an intramuscular injection during 1 MAC of halothane anesthesia. Recently, however, rocuronium has been reported to cause pain after intravenous injection. [2,3] Fifty-two percent of patients to whom a subparalyzing dose of rocuronium had been administered complained of pain; of these, 12% experienced severe pain. [2] Therefore, some intrinsic irritating property of rocuronium causing pain on injection rather than the \"light\" anesthesia may be the cause of the reaction described."}

The headlines this week were mostly about the two Pro Bowl quarterbacks who were facing off in this game, but the real story on Sunday was the two very solid defenses.\n\nIt is easy to focus on the positive after a win, and there were plenty of positive in this game. Russell Wilson throwing for 320 yards would be one, and the defense only giving up seven points would be another.\n\nAt the same time, the Seahawks were far from perfect in this game. The offensive line really struggled, and the penalty problem that plagued this team in the preseason showed up again.

Research indicates that respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) biofeedback increases HRV while reducing related pathological symptoms. This controlled pilot study compared RSA biofeedback to progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) as adjunctive interventions for 38 persons with PTSD symptoms in a residential treatment facility for a substance use disorder. Both groups were assessed at pre-intervention and 4-week post-intervention. Group x time interactions revealed significantly greater reductions in depressive symptoms and increases in HRV indices for the RSA group. Both groups significantly reduced PTSD and insomnia symptoms and a statistical trend was observed for reduced substance craving for the RSA group. Increases in HRV were significantly associated with PTSD symptom reduction. Overall, these results provide preliminary support for the efficacy of RSA biofeedback in improving physiological and psychological health for individuals with PTSD."}

But did you know he ALSO wrote a short piece of fiction about \"the birth of the napkin\" in 2003? And to add further humor: This same book contains an endorsement of the Santorums from Bono of U2, and includes a foreword on \"decent manners with children\" by Joe Paterno.\n\nLook inside \"Karen Santorum's Dirty Book on Manners\" at Ethan's website, and you can buy a copy on Amazon. One wonders if future printings will scrub the reference to Paterno (and if the Bono endorsement will stay?)"}

Since then I've done work for Mart...\n\nThis is the MOST EXPENSIVE CAKE IN THE WORLD! Well ok, not really, but my 24 Carrot Cake is definitely the most expensive LOOKING cake and it tastes like a million bucks, so I count that as close. (A food friend for the new gold MacBook Pro...)\n\nFUN FACT: There are actually 24 baby carrots used in the cake recipe, so the title is completely legit.\n\nOk, let's get fancy everyone!\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nCheck out some of my other fun/cheeky projects:\n\nBeer Koozie Mittens\n\nPaddleball Set\n\nJackalope Costume\n\nSnickerPoodles\n\nPortable Park"}
{"text": "The Buddha's Teaching As It Is\n\nIn the fall of 1979, while living at the Washington Buddhist Vihara, Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi gave a series of lectures on the fundamental teachings of Early Buddhism. Bhante Gunaratana, at the time the President of the Buddhist Vihara Society, suggested he record the lectures so that the Vihara could distribute them as a set of cassette tapes.\n\nIn the summer of 1981, Ven. Bodhi recorded his ten lectures in the basement of the Washington Buddhist Vihara, using an ordinary, nonprofessional recorder. An enthusiastic lay supporter had the master copies reproduced in large quantities for expanded distribution. They have continued to be distributed on tape and as CDs for over twenty-five years, and are considered \"public domain\" for anyone to copy and distribute freely. The one condition is that they must not be sold.\n\nWe recommend that the first time you listen to them, you listen to them in their proper sequence:"}

{"text": "Seth Rogen will forever be a thorn in Amy Pascal's side. He already cost the former Sony co-chair her job, thanks to The Interview debacle, and now she can't even move into her new office in peace, because guess who it used to belong to? That's right, everyone's favorite potheads, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, who apparently smoked so much weed there that they can't get the stench out in time for Pascal's transition to producer. It's not that cleaning people weren't hired; it's just that for some reason, they just keep on taking breaks to eat all the chips.\n\nUpdate: Seth Rogen has a few choices words for THR's report, and one of them is definitely not stench: \"I don't know what's more irresponsible: that they would print a story that is completely untrue, or that they would refer to how pot smells as a 'stench.' #myshitssmellsgood.\""}
{"text": "In what could be described as a tense meeting of the Jersey City Board of Education, the teachers union, following the call of JCEA President Ronnie Greco, walked out on the meeting following comments made by BOE President Sangeeta Ranade.\n\n\nGreco started off the meeting with a fiery speech, beginning by calling on the board to expedite changes to school security at PS 41 following reports of an intruder entering into a trailer.\n\nDr. Marcia Lyles responded later on in the meeting as to what the district was doing regarding security at PS 41.\n\nFurther on in Greco's speech he made reference to a labor dispute, saying a teacher was unfairly punished for seeking union advice, and vowed to see the district in court.\n\nDuring remarks by the board, Ranade questioned whether the union was acting in good faith. After finishing her comments, and calling the meeting to order due to crowd noise, the Jersey City teachers union collectively walked out."}
