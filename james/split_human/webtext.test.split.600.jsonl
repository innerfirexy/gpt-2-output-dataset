{"text": "Steps on how to enable developer mode on your Xbox One\n\nHow to sideload Retrix and use it\n\nThe Xbox One now has a port of LibRetro, called Retrix. Thanks to the hard work of @Absestos , they've ported some of the LibRetro cores to UWP, which both Windows 10 and Xbox One users can use. You can currently emulate games from a wide range of systems, like the NES, SNES, GBA, Sega Genesis, PlayStation 1, with even more additions planned in the future, like N64 and Dreamcast. Retrix also allows for 2 player support, as well as savestates. The project is still early in development, but has come a long way in a short amount of time.The caveat to being able to access this, is that users will need a Developer Account, for their Xbox One. The process is simple, but requires $19.99 to activate, permanently. You then receive 3 slots to register any accounts to. You can do that by followingI personally tried out the emulator myself, using the following games.Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island: Works fullspeed, but crashes at randomContra III: Runs well, but experiences slowdown during explosionsSecret of Mana: Works fullspeedSuper Mario World: Works fullspeedAll GameBoy and GameBoy Color games crashed the program.Sonic Advance 3: Runs fullspeed.Pokemon Fire Red: Does not boot.Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow: Runs fullspeed.Fire Emblem: Sacred Stones: Runs fullspeed.All attempted titles besides Sonic Chaos resulted in a black screen.Sonic 3: Runs fine except when you lose rings, which causes slowdownRoad Rash: Runs fine until you get hit, and the game has a runtime errorSonic CD: Works fullspeedShining Force CD: Works fullspeed1. Obtain a developer account.2. On your Xbox One, install the free \"Dev Mode Activation\" app from the Xbox store3. The Xbox will then give you a 6 digit code, on your computer, go to theand put the code in there.4. Your system will confirm the activation code, and prompt you to restart into Developer Mode1. After the above steps, the console will be in Developer Mode. You will then see your Xbox One's IP on the home menu.2. Type this IP into your browser, which will take you a hub page. You can upload the .APPX for Retrix here. It'll install to your Xbox, and you'll be good to go.3. PlayStation and Sega CD games require BIOS. You'll need these to play games from either of those systems.4. Get a USB with a roms folder on root, put any roms and BIOS files there.5. You're done! Select a given system from Retrix's menu, and load your rom, and it will boot."}

Initially, Crews opted not to name the \"high-level Hollywood executive\" who allegedly groped him. But in a powerful interview with Michael Strahan on Good Morning America Wednesday, Crews spoke freely and frankly, holding no details back.\n\n\"Back in February 2016, I was assaulted by Adam Venit,\" Crews began, \"who is the head of the motion picture department at William Morris Endeavor, one of the biggest agencies in the world.\"\n\nThe 49-year-old Brooklyn Nine-Nine actor attended an event with his wife and Adam Sandler, who is a client of Venit's. Though Crews knew many actors repped by Venit, he'd never met him before this first, disturbing encounter.\n\nCrews described fielding stares from Venit all night and that Venit was \"sticking his tongue out\" in a way that made Crews uncomfortable. When Venit approached him, Crews offered to shake his hand. Instead, Venit squeezed Crews' genitals. Despite Crews' negative reaction, he said Venit just laughed and continued to harass him.\n\n\"I have never felt more emasculated, more objectified. I was horrified,\" Crews said. The actor credits his wife, Rebecca King, for encouraging him to exit the situation without violence.\n\nAs reported by Deadline last week, Crews filed a report with the Los Angeles Police Department against Venit for sexual assault. \"People need to be held accountable. This is an abuse of power. He's one of the most powerful men in Hollywood,\" Crews told Strahan.\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nCharley Gallay/Getty Images\n\nVenit is currently on leave from his position at the head of WME's motion picture group.

He also represents Emma Stone, Diane Keaton, Shawn Levy, Vince Vaughn, Kevin James and Eddie Murphy. Venit began his career with Endeavor in 1996, before the company merged with William Morris Agency in 2009.\n\nCrews faced criticism for sharing his story on Twitter without naming names. \"When a person of power breaks that boundary, violates that boundary, you're a prisoner of war,\" Crews said, adding that he completely understood why so many women waited to come forward about Weinstein. \"I will not be shamed.

United hope to have both players on board their flight bound for Seattle on Monday as they embark on a pre-season tour of the United States.\n\nVan Gaal had identified Schneiderlin, who had also attracted tentative interest from Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur, as a prospective long-term successor to Michael Carrick in United midfield's after his impressive displays for Southampton last season, when he made 28 Premier League appearances, two as a substitute, in a team who finished seventh. An initial bid of £20m from United was turned down last month, though Southampton's manager, Ronald Koeman, admitted on the squad's return for pre-season training that \"every player has his price\".\n\nParis Saint-Germain set to offer £47m for Manchester United's Ángel Di María Read more\n\nIt is understood that add-ons written into the deal could bring the total fee payable for Schneiderlin closer to Southampton's long established £27m valuation.\n\nMeanwhile, Koeman suggested he was planning for life without the 25-year-old midfielder, who had risen through the divisions with Southampton since arriving from Strasbourg as a teenager. Koeman is expected to secure the Feyenoord midfielder, Jordy Clasie, as a replacement with the Dutch club having omitted the player from a pre-season friendly against Fortuna Düsseldorf on Sunday with talks over his future at an advanced stage.\n\nSchneiderlin will link up in United's midfield with Schweinsteiger next season after the German international's arrival from Bayern. The World Cup winner flew in to Manchester on Sunday to undergo a medical and sign the paperwork after bidding farewell to Bayern's fans in a statement and video posted on Twitter.\n\n\"The decision was very hard to make because you and FCB have and always will be an extremely important part of my life,\" said the 30-year-old, who won eight Bundesliga titles, seven DFB-Pokals and the Champions League in a 17-year career in Bavaria. \"Nevertheless, I would like to gain experience at a new club. My destination is Manchester United. I hope you understand my decision.

Throughout his career, McCabe has held leadership positions in the Counterterrorism Division, the National Security Branch and the Washington Field Office.\n\nComey promoted McCabe to FBI deputy director in January 2016 to oversee the agency's international investigative and intelligence activities.\n\n\"Andy's 19 years of experience, combined with his vision, judgment, and ability to communicate make him a perfect fit for this job,\" Comey said at the time.\n\nMcCabe has not been without controversey, however.\n\nHis wife Jill McCabe ran for a Virginia State Senate seat as a Democrat in 2015, during when she received nearly $500,000 in campaign donations from Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe — a close Clinton family ally.\n\nBecause of this, Republicans have criticized McCabe for not recusing himself from the Department of Justice's broad investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails. In questioning his independence, Republicans have also wondered why he has not recused himself from the probe into Russia's role in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nAt the time, in October 2016, the FBI told the Wall Street Journal that McCabe sought internal guidance \"to prevent against any actual or potential conflict-of-interest\" and when his wife chose to run, \"McCabe and FBI lawyers implemented a system of recusal from all FBI investigative matters involving Virginia politics, a process followed for the remainder of her campaign. During the campaign, he played no role, attended no events, and did not participate in fundraising or support of any kind.\"\n\nMore recently, both Comey and McCabe may have violated multiple DOJ rules when they spoke with White House chief of staff Reince Priebus about their Russia probe.\n\nAccording to February reports, Priebus asks the two to publicly refute a New York Times story and a CNN story about Trump's associates' contacts with Russian intelligence during the 2016 campaign.\n\nThe FBI refused to knock down the media reports, but the White House told CNN the request was made \"only after the FBI indicated to the White House it did not believe the reporting to be accurate.\"\n\nAccording to NBC News, McCabe is not expected to be in the role for very long.

At first I thought that I was just being paranoid, that this was just a phase. But things only got worse. Fourth month in and he was now only texting me during weekends after midnight. Our longest conversations consisted of him asking me \"where are you\" at 2 am or \"I miss you\" when we he barely even tried to see me. I knew right then that he was losing interest and that I should move on.\n\nIt has been two weeks and this time, we haven't talked at all. This \"ghosting\" phenomenon has happened to me twice now, only to hurt me much more than before. Being ghosted twice, I now find myself asking: What did I do wrong? Why did they suddenly disappear? Am I a bad kisser? Am I ugly? Maybe if I did this or that... In short, it really, really hurts. It hurts so much and it affects my ego in such a way that I now feel like crap and insecure. The once confident and nice me has turned into a cold closed-off person. I would rather a guy be honest with me - \"I am not interested anymore because (the reason)\" - than leave me all of a sudden with no hints and out of the blue.\n\nI stare at my phone feeling empty because he would be talking to me by now wishing me goodnight. I have nightmares and every time I see a picture of him on social media smiling with friends or laughing. I ask myself, \"was I that easy to forget?\" This \"ghosting\" should really stop. Guys, please never do this. Always always be strong and confront the girl because it would mean a lot to her even though it might hurt her at first. And girls, never feel worthless if you have been ghosted. Its not our fault men who ghost us are just afraid of confrontation and are weak.\n\nSomeone disappearing on you does not reflect your worth. It reflects their fear and insecurity."}
{"text": "Metrics are an important part of incident response. You should know your average time to detect compromised systems and how successful phishing campaigns are against your users. To start successful metrics, you need to choose a taxonomy to use. In this example, we will be using the VERIS(1) taxonomy. It is well documented and allows you to compare yourself to the DBIR report.\n\nOne of the problems with metrics is the amount of time it takes to enter data and correlate it. While it may take less than 5 minutes to determine how many people responded to a phish, it may take up to 20 minutes to create the tickets in your tracking system. To greatly increase your efficiency and accuracy, scripting should be used.\n\nRTIR(2) is an open source ticketing system for incident response based on Request Tracker. This system can be built based on the VERIS taxonomy by creating custom fields that match the categories. This system supports using a REST API(3) to automate the creation of tickets.\n\nWe need to create the following custom fields for our use case. Some of these will have static values and others will need to enter as a command line argument.\n\nhacking.discovery_method, hacking.targeted, impact.security_incident, social.variety, social.vector,social.target, confidentiality.data.variety, misuse.variety\n\nAdditionally, we want to track other stats that aren't used in VERIS, but are very useful for tracking campaigns.\n\nvictim-username,ioc.attacker.ip, ioc.attacker.domain\n\nNow that we have the basic breakdown of what fields we want to enter data in, we need to script it (4). You need to make sure you put in your credentials to the script along with the IP/DNS name of your server. The two main parts that you can adjust to fit any incident type are the arguments and the post_data. The ticket will be created and closed when the script is complete.\n\nTo run this script as posted, do the following:\n\n>rt-phishing.py --username bob --ip 127.0.0.1 --domain malware.bad --creator twebb --time 5\n\nWhile metrics are important, they shouldn't be demanding to create.

Having already brought in players such as Carlos Bacca, Alessio Romagnolio and Andrea Bertolacci, they are looking to add more big names to get back into the top European competition and the money it brings.\n\nForced off through injury against Swansea, there has been no clarification by the club as to how serious, or not, the injury is. Steve McClaren having described it as a problem with Sissoko's groin in his post-match interview.\n\nAfter exploding into the first team when he arrived, Moussa Sissoko has largely disappointed compared to the promise he showed on that day when he scored two in the win against Chelsea and showed Ashley Cole a clean pair of heels despite giving him a couple of yards head start.\n\nInteresting to see if Mike Ashley is willing to cash in on Moussa Sissoko if the right offer comes in and even more interesting to see where Steve McClaren sees the midfielder playing, if he does honestly see the French international being at the heart of his new look Newcastle United."}

However, at the heart of it, and often overlooked, sits the Grade II listed signal box on Navigation Street, which houses the centre of all rail operations of the station.\n\nThe corrugated concrete Brutalist structure may polarise public opinion, but is actually home of one of the city's most vital and intense infrastructure systems, serving the busiest rail interchange in the UK.\n\nDesigned by Bicknell & Hamilton and W.R. Healey and completed in 1965, the unapologetically bunker-like structure is an honest expression of its utilitarian function. Standing five storeys high above track level, the building gives no clue of the hive of activity that exists within its four walls.\n\nThe technology inside is of the same era as the exterior façade and was revolutionary for its time. The Relay Room sits just above street level and houses enormous banks of algorithmic electronic relays, known as Wespacs, which are programmed to calculate legal routes for the trains to take.\n\nTo maintain these systems, Network Rail engineers have to retain specialist knowledge of technology that is decades old. The long aisles of Wespacs are lit by incessantly flashing green and red lights and the extraordinary sound of thousands of relays clicking fills the room.\n\nThe top floor, or the Operational Floor, is reminiscent of the lair of a 1960s Bond villain. From their elevated perch a dedicated team operates 24/7, 365 days a year, and has done since the Signal Box opened.\n\nStood in front of a gigantic processing unit, which maps out the rail network with intertwining lines of LED lights and buttons, the team plan the routes for every train between Birmingham International and Wolverhampton.\n\nLove it or hate it, signal boxes are soon to be a thing of the past. Over the next decade the signal boxes of the UK will be consolidated into centralised control centres where a single computer will control vast areas of track, a far cry from the ticking behemoths of the New Street Signal Box.\n\nThankfully, due its listed status, the humble concrete box on Navigation Street will remain a bastion for the romance of the railways, if only in spirit.\n\nMatthew Goer, Associated Architects\n\nThe first Hidden Spaces feature looks at the opulence of Birmingham's Victorian Council House and its wartime secrets\n\nWe also take a look at the Chamberlain Clock Tower, also known as Big Brum and its commanding views across the city\n\nBirmingham's mysterious Perrott's Folly is another of the buildings featured in the Hidden Spaces features\n\nThe full Hidden Spaces supplements are included in the Boxing Day and January 2 editions of the Birmingham Post"}

But headhunters also say Indians are more willing to move\n\nthan Chinese, who see more opportunity and good pay at home,\" it said.\n\nThe report said that Nadella's appointment as CEO has \"caused a bit of a stir in China, where people are questioning why Indians but not\n\nChinese are getting top jobs in the US.\" The other reasons cited by the report are the high pay and advancement opportunities that are keeping many Chinese executives at home.\n\nIt said annual salaries for management positions at the director level in China are already at about USD 131,000, which is four times as much as in India, where executives at that level earn USD 35,000 on average.\n\nThe report said that while India remains a \"tough\" place to live, China has become more comfortable in recent years, offering a good lifestyle to expatriates. \"How do you get a Chinese to move to Brazil in a developmental sequence? That's a big challenge,\" said Emmanuel Hemmerle, a senior adviser to Korn Ferry, an executive search firm.\n\n\"China is such a high-growth market. Everyone sees that's where the opportunity is.\" China, however, suffers from a \"shortage\" of top talent, despite its enormous pool of university graduates, with 7.3 million more expected in 2014, the report said.\n\nCiting consulting firm McKinsey that fewer than 10 per cent of Chinese job candidates would be suitable for work in a foreign company because of their \"poor command of English and an education system that focuses on theory rather than practical skills.\"\n\nAnother reason why Chinese executives do not flock to western companies is that state-owned enterprises and private companies are\n\nbidding for home-grown talent.\n\n\"With so much attention lavished on the most promising executives in China, many feel their opportunities are greater at home than abroad,\" the WSJ report said.\n\nIn some cases, multinational companies also want to keep their best Chinese executives inside China because the market is so important to them. A downside to being too attached to China is the risk that Chinese executives are overtaken in their careers by the next wave of Chinese managers, many of whom have better language skills and a broader world view."}

Some questions, as you may have suspected, concern his upcoming Gambit movie, one of the new standalones spinning off from Fox's X-Men universe.\n\n\"I love Gambit,\" says Tatum exclusively in Empire. \"I grew up in the South; my father's from Louisiana. We'd go to New Orleans and I heard all the dialects. It felt so different from the rest of America; it has its own ancient culture. So I identified with that. And he always felt the most real of the X-Men to me. He's kind of a tortured soul and he's not a good guy. But he's not a bad guy, either. He walks his own path. And of course he plays cards and drinks and is a martial-arts badass!\"\n\nFor those not already in the know, Marvel's official wiki describes the ragin' Cajun - real name Remy Etienne LeBeau - as a mutant with the power to... well, it's complicated.\n\n\"Gambit has the mutant ability to tap into the potential energy contained within an object and transform it into kinetic energy upon touching it,\" runs the wiki. \"When Gambit thus charges an object and throws it at a target, the object releases this energy explosively on impact. Gambit is unable to use this power to charge living objects.\"\n\nThis explains all those pink cards he slings at his foes. What it doesn't explain is Taylor Kitsch's disappointing turn as the character in the equally disappointing X-Men Origins: Wolverine. It's still unclear whether the new script from RoboCop screenwriter Josh Zetumer will ignore his previous appearance in the X-verse.\n\n\"Josh Zetumer just turned in the first draft of the script, and it's killer,\" adds Tatum. \"None of us were sure how he was going to deal with the X-Men world. But we're going to be changing some of the tropes of these movies. It's always about saving the world (laughs), but maybe we're going to shift things a liittle but. There's so many ways you can take [an origin story]. You could do it like Batman Begins, or a different take and go the Guardians Of The Galaxy route. All I can say is, I'm super excited.\"\n\nFinding a unique way to save the world in a comic-book superhero movie is an increasingly big ask, but with the man who helped bring the Jump Street fanchise to life - and brought a whole new angle to Superman for The Lego Movie - at the helm, things are looking positive.\n\nWith no director officially attached, the Gambit movie is set for an October 7, 2016 release."}

Cam Kowalski of the Richmond RCMP which handles an average of 35 calls a year where aircraft coming into YVR have been hit by the intense light from a laser.\n\nAnd that's no mean feat considering some of the lasers being used have a range of 100 miles or more — a capability that gives culprits the ability to set up and pin point aircraft from just about anywhere along the flightpath in the Lower Mainland.\n\n\"We're responding to calls from places like Garry Point here in Richmond, out to Burnaby and Port Coquitlam,\" said Kowalski who specializes in the field of visual interference with aircraft which is becoming more common as prices for powerful lasers make them more accessible.\n\n\"In the last 10 to 12 years there's been a dramatic increase in laser strikes globally, which includes YVR,\" Kowalski said. \"What we've done is create a response protocol for laser strikes.\"\n\nIt's one now being used nationally with local law enforcement agencies racking up the best rate for arrest and conviction — four in the past six to eight months, Kowalski said.\n\n\"We've been able to close the (communication) loop between the actual aircraft on descent, to NAV Canada, E-Comm and the police in the jurisdiction affected,\" Kowalski said.\n\n\"So, everybody is aware and responds accordingly when a call comes in, giving it the seriousness it deserves.\"\n\nOnce police have been notified in the suspected community where the laser strike originated, the decision is made to employ a K-9 unit, or even task one of the RCMP's two helicopters to try and locate the suspect(s).\n\nAs to why someone would target an aircraft with a laser, Kowalski said some may see it as a form of entertainment, while if an intent to harm is present, that vaults the offence into more serious territory.\n\nThose found guilty are subject to federal and provincial penalties under the criminal code, aeronautics act and Canadian aviation regulations, Kowalski said, adding the penalties can include a $1,000 fine and forfeiture of the laser.\n\n\"Under the criminal code we'd like to see a substantial increase in terms of jail time due to the seriousness of the matter,\" he added.\n\nIn the U.S., it can delve into charges of terrorism, Kowalski said, with one offender serving 14 years in prison."}

He particularly condemned \"the distortion of the advancement and protection of human rights used with a selective and discriminatory approach to validate and impose political decisions\" and the \"irrational and unsustainable consumerism\" that he alleged is exacerbating climate change.\n\nA pillar of international relations, Castro asserted, is the \"profound respect for the inalienable right of every state to choose their social, economic, and cultural system.\" He followed this with praise for Venezuela's socialist dictatorship and fellow ally Ecuador, as well as a call for Puerto Rico to leave the United States. \"The people of Puerto Rico deserve to be free and independent after more than a century of colonial domination,\" he stated.\n\nDuring the last referendum on changing its status, only 5% of Puerto Ricans voted for independence. 61% voted for Puerto Rico to be fully annex into America as a U.S. state.\n\nCastro saved the topic of associating with the United States diplomatically for last, and asserted a number of demands that he has previously made publicly, but apparently Cuban diplomats have not successfully yet at the bargaining table. Total normalization of relations, Castro insisted, \"this will only be achieved with the end of the economic, commercial, and financial blockade against Cuba, the return to our country of the land illegally occupied in Guantánamo Bay,\" and \"the cessation of radio and television broadcasts meant to destabilize.\" He also demanded in vague terms that \"our people [be] compensated for the human and economic damages they still endure.\"\n\nThe \"radio and television broadcasts\" Castro referenced are free public broadcasts on Radio and TV Martí, publicly-funded American organizations that focus on coverage of political happenings of interest to a Cuban and Cuban-American audience. In calling for the censorship of the Martí broadcasts, Castro is imploring President Obama to violate the First Amendment of the Constitution.\n\nRegarding the embargo, the United States has largely lifted its restrictions on the island. As a consequence of the deal President Obama brokered with the communist regime, travel and business restrictions on Cuba have largely been lifted.\n\nCubans are almost entirely prevented from freely conducting business, however, and cannot travel out of the country without special permits from the government. Cubans can only travel freely to other ally nations, like Russia and Cambodia. Cubans are also limited in their right to receive gifts from American citizens; in September 2014, Cuban significantly strengthened its embargo on American products entering the island."}

They think about it, dream about it, obsess about it... but they never accomplish it.\n\nThat could be because they also talk about it.\n\nAccording to studies like this one, people who talk about their intentions are less likely to follow through on those intentions.\n\nSay you want to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail, a grueling five- to seven-month trek from Georgia to Maine. (Having completed about 2% of it, I'm not so well on my way.)\n\nYou're having dinner with friends, and you tell them about it.\n\n\"Oh, wow!\" one exclaims. \"That sounds amazing.

It feels awesome to bask in the glow of people who admire you for wanting to take on such a huge challenge.\n\nIt feels like you're already on the Trail.\n\nIt also means you're less likely to actually be on the Trail someday, because \"when other people take notice of an individual's identity-related behavioral intention, this gives the individual a premature sense of possessing the aspired-to identity.\"\n\nIn short, you already got a kick out of people thinking of you as a Trail hiker... so now you're less motivated to actually be a Trail hiker.\n\nSounds counterintuitive, right? Aren't we supposed to share our intentions so other people can help support and motivate us?\n\nAccording to NYU psychologist Peter Gollwitzer, one of the authors of the study, that's not the case.\n\nGollwitzer thinks the issue lies in our sense of identity. Each of us wants to be certain things, and we naturally declare those intentions, even if we have not yet become those things. (Check out Twitter profiles bios if you don't believe me--tons of people are motivated, innovative, creative, passionate, and unique gurus, ninjas, and connoisseurs.)\n\nDescribing how I plan to run a marathon, and how I bought running shoes and joined a gym and created a training plan, certainly makes me feel good... but it also makes me feel like I'm already part of the way there even though I haven't trained at all.\n\nDeclaring what we want to be and how we will get there causes us to somehow feel we are farther along the path of becoming who we want to be, and therefore less motivated--even though we've actually done nothing but talk.\n\nSo try it. Pick a goal. Create a plan to achieve it. Then keep your goal and your plan to yourself. Focus solely on doing the work required to achieve your goal."}
{"text": "Today was supposed to be the day that Verizon's new 4G \"network optimization\" policy went into effect. Verizon's heaviest data users on grandfathered unlimited plans faced the possibility of having their speeds throttled down to make room on the LTE network for customers who pay for data by the gigabyte. But Wednesday afternoon, Verizon said it would pull the plug on the new policy before it went into effect.\n\nHere's Verizon's statement:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVerizon is committed to providing its customers with an unparalleled mobile network experience. At a time of ever-increasing mobile broadband data usage, we not only take pride in the way we manage our network resources, but also take seriously our responsibility to deliver exceptional mobile service to every customer. We've greatly valued the ongoing dialogue over the past several months concerning network optimization and we've decided not to move forward with the planned implementation of network optimization for 4G LTE customers on unlimited plans. Exceptional network service will always be our priority and we remain committed to working closely with industry stakeholders to manage broadband issues so that American consumers get the world-class mobile service they expect and value.\n\nThe new policy first came to light when Verizon started shipping notices to its unlimited plan customers in July. The carrier tried to play down its significance by saying it wasn't a true throttling program because it didn't automatically restrict speeds to 2G or 3G rates when customers hit a pre-defined data limit each month.\n\nInstead, [company]Verizon[/company] said that the restrictions would only go into effect when the network was congested. If there were unlimited and metered data customers competing for the same bandwidth then Verizon would prioritize the traffic of everyone else over the traffic of its heaviest unlimited customers.\n\nTo fall under the guidelines, you would have had to have been an unlimited plan customer on contract in the top 5 percent of Verizon's data users. Even those who fell under the restrictions would be affected rarely, and in many cases they wouldn't even notice it happening, Verizon claimed.\n\nVerizon's unlimited customers weren't happy about the change and neither was the Federal Communications Commission. Already mired in heated net neutrality debate, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler penned an angry letter to Verizon questioning the new proposal's motives.\n\n\"'Reasonable network management' concerns the technical management of your network; it is not a loophole designed to enhance your revenue streams,\" Wheeler said in the letter. \"It is disturbing to me that Verizon Wireless would base its 'network management' on distinctions among its customers' data plans, rather than on network architecture or technology.\"\n\nApparently the customer and regulatory blowback was greater than Verizon anticipated so it decided to can the idea. That said, Verizon is still restricting speeds for its heaviest unlimited users on 3G — it's been doing so for years — but for now those customers will have free reign on Big Red's LTE network.\n\nThis post was updated at 2 PM PT with more background information"}

The service receives a Go program, compiles, links, and runs the program inside a sandbox, then returns the output.\n\nIf the program contains tests or examples and no main function, the service runs the tests. Benchmarks will likely not be supported since the program runs in a sandboxed environment with limited resources.\n\nThere are limitations to the programs that can be run in the playground:\n\nThe playground can use most of the standard library, with some exceptions. The only communication a playground program has to the outside world is by writing to standard output and standard error.\n\nIn the playground the time begins at 2009-11-10 23:00:00 UTC (determining the significance of this date is an exercise for the reader). This makes it easier to cache programs by giving them deterministic output.\n\nThere are also limits on execution time and on CPU and memory usage.\n\nThe article \"Inside the Go Playground\" describes how the playground is implemented. The source code is available at https://go.googlesource.com/playground.\n\nThe playground uses the latest stable release of Go.\n\nThe current version is go1.10.3.\n\nThe playground service is used by more than just the official Go project (Go by Example is one other instance) and we are happy for you to use it on your own site.

It found that participants who regularly engaged in word puzzles like crosswords had brain function 10 years younger than their calendar age. They were tested for attention, short-term memory accuracy, grammatical reasoning and speed.\n\nWATCH BELOW: New way to detect Alzheimer's disease\n\n\"Our study suggests that the frequency of use of word puzzles is related to superior cognitive function on a range of different tests, even after controlling for age, education and gender,\" Keith Wesnes, lead author of the study and professor of cognitive neuroscience at the University of Exeter, said to Global News.\n\n\"One likely explanation is that when engaging in such tasks, the brain has increased blood flow to certain areas, which could have beneficial effects on brain structure and integrity. The concept of 'use it or lose it' could well apply here.\"\n\nAlthough the study has not evaluated whether it makes a difference when people take up word puzzles — if they've been doing them all their lives versus starting them in later years — it did find that those who engaged in them more frequently performed better on the evaluating tasks. Wesnes says similar findings were seen in those who engaged in number puzzles, like Sudoku.\n\nThis study could \"cast doubt\" on the negative responses to brain training games like Lumosity, Wesnes says.\n\nIn January 2016, Aditi Jhaveri, a consumer education specialist with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection, published a blog post widely debunking Lumosity's \"proven neuroscience research\" that claims to prevent age-related memory decline.\n\n\"The FTC charged that there isn't solid science showing that Lumosity's 'brain training' games work the way they say they would,\" she wrote. \"Playing Lumosity's games might make you better at those games, the FTC says, but that doesn't necessarily mean it will sharpen your memory or brain power in the real world.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Your trouble with sleeping may put you at risk for Alzheimer's disease later in life\n\nWesnes says that they will be conducting a trial where participants will engage in games like those offered by Lumosity to assess whether their cognitive function improves.\n\n\"If that occurred, it would clearly debunk [the FTC's claims],\" he said.\n\nAccording to the Alzheimer Society of Canada, there are 564,000 Canadians living with dementia and that number will skyrocket to 937,000 in 15 years. The annual cost to the country is $10.4 billion.\n\nIn addition to word and number puzzles, exercise and diet have been shown to delay the onset of cognitive decline in old age."}
{"text": "In retrospect, it seems obvious that John Stumpf wouldn't keep his job.\n\nThe Wells Fargo CEO retired yesterday (Oct. 12), capping a brutal five weeks that began with the revelation that thousands of the bank's employees were misusing customer information to open accounts they never asked for. The fallout included two punishing hearings before Congress and an embarrassing report indicating the fraud started as early as 2005.\n\nWhether Stumpf jumped or was pushed out by the board, it now seems clear the company is eager to turn the page, just in time for its third-quarter earnings release, which is scheduled for Oct. 14.\n\nBut it wasn't long ago that Stumpf appeared safe. He was chairman of the board, he had the backing of investors including Warren Buffett, and significantly, he delivered a 68% total return to shareholders over the course of his tenure—not bad considering he was steering Wells Fargo through the financial crisis or the aftermath for most of the nine years he led the company. And he wasn't just another banking chief, he was 2015's CEO of the Year, according to Morningstar (which might now be having some second thoughts).\n\nI was so confident that he would withstand the onslaught, that I publicly predicted as much. I figured the company would accept its $185 million fine—a pittance for a bank with $86 billion in annual revenue—and accept Stumpf's tongue-lashing by Congress as just another cost of doing business.\n\nHere's what I didn't fully appreciate:\n\nThis fraud was different. Unlike previous banking scandals, Wells Fargo's crimes were easily understood—and the targets of the malfeasance were ordinary banking customers. This scandal didn't involve exotic financial instruments like synthetic credit default swaps, and the victims weren't faceless institutional investors, but our neighbors.\n\nIt couldn't be easily explained away. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon was able to evade more serious consequences over the the so-called London Whale trading scandal because he could blame a flawed hedging strategy and the bad actions of a few traders. It was much harder for Wells Fargo to dismiss its problems as limited in scope after it fired 5,300 employees, and with so much of the blame aimed directly at the bank's ruthless sales culture.\n\nOccasionally the system works. It's easy to become jaded after years of watching CEOs and other senior executives evade responsibility for their actions. The biggest US banks paid more than $100 billion in fines for their involvement in the mortgage crisis, without a single CEO of these institutions losing his job over it. Yet in this case, the mounting pressure from Congress, the media, and the bank's falling share price was enough to trigger Stumpf's exit.\n\nIt could be that the Wells Fargo scandal presented a unique set of circumstances, and so is unlikely to repeated. Or perhaps it's the dawn of a new era of corporate responsibility. But I'm not making any predictions."}
{"text": "Senator Bernie Sanders delivers a speech on 'democratic socialism' at Georgetown University on November 19, 2015 in Washington, DC. (Jonathan Newton / The Washington Post)\n\nBernie Sanders's campaign told The Post's John Wagner on Wednesday that the Vermont senator has received more than 2 million individual donations. Many donors have given multiple times, meaning that the number of individual donors is itself nearing 1 million in total.\n\nSo is that a lot, or what? One million people is more than have ever given me money, for example, but is it more than have ever given to anyone? How much of an outlier is Sanders, exactly?\n\nThat's a surprisingly hard question to answer.\n\nThe Federal Election Commission compiles data on contributions made to candidates, allowing us to get some sense of what's normal. Excluding contributions to the two parties and their congressional campaign arms, here are the campaigns with the most individual contributions since 1980.\n\nAt the top is the 2008 Obama campaign, understandably, followed by his 2012 race. (There are occasionally multiple committees associated with campaigns, so some candidate-cycle combinations show up multiple times.) Obama's 2012 campaign committee actually got enough contributions in the 2014 midterm cycle to make the top 50.\n\nAnd now the \"yes, buts\" come pouring in. This is contributions, not contributors, meaning that people who gave multiple times are included multiple times. What's more, it excludes donors who gave too little to need to be reported. Campaigns only have to itemize contributions from contributors that meet a certain threshhold ($200 currently); if not, the FEC doesn't get the data. Sanders's campaign counts these unitemized donations, but the chart above can't.\n\nLook at 2012, for example. That year, the Obama campaign reported tallying more than 4 million individual donors. The Campaign Finance Institute, which also compiles this data, figured that Obama had 813,402 individual donors through December 2012. The FEC report for that cycle, though, only has about 437,000 contributions.\n\nThat's a wide gap, and we're largely left taking Obama's word for it.\n\nWe're comparing apples and oranges here, of course. Bernie Sanders has at least another few months to raise money; naturally he has fewer donors than Barack Obama had at the end of 2012.\n\nIt also makes sense that Sanders would be among those with the most all-time donors simply for the fact that he's running for president. It's usually presidential candidates that garner the most individual donors in a presidential cycle; after all, everyone in the country has a direct interest in the outcome. During off-year elections, the most contributions were usually given to party campaign committees. (The exception? Ed Zschau's 1986 senate race in California.)\n\nIncidentally, that ActBlue in 2016 -- the committee that's got the most contributions so far this cycle -- is raising money for a guy named Bernie Sanders."}
{"text": "Everyone likes clean wheels but not everyone has them. Why? Because wheels can be tricky for many to clean. They are unsure of the tools and chemicals to use and that ends with a big headache and uncleaned wheels.\n\nToday you will see how to quickly and safely clean your wheels thoroughly. I will show you 3 must-have wheel cleaning tools and what I personally believe is the best wheel cleaner on the market. With these 4 items, your wheels will be easier to clean and they will stay looking better without killing yourself or destroying your knuckles.\n\nHere are some AMAZON links to the tools of choice found in this article:\n\nWheel barrel tools\n\nDeep dish brush\n\nBoar's hair brush\n\nSonax Wheel Cleaner Plus\n\nAll wheel cleaners have their own blend and have different directions. Make sure to always follow the direction as noted on the bottle.\n\nWe begin by applying the Sonax Wheel Cleaner Plus to a cool wheel. Be sure to coat the face and the barrel with the cleaner.\n\nShortly after applying the cleaner, it will begin to turn a deep purple color. The product is now breaking down ferrous materials…not just removing them.\n\nAllow the cleaner to dwell for 3-5 minutes per the directions(including your clean time).\n\nDraw out your wheel barrel tool and go to town on the inner barrel. The long reach will allow you to easily clean the deeper recesses. Be sure to sway the tool behind the spokes as well!\n\nThen move to your deep dish brush. It has a flexible stem that can be bent to reach behind spokes and around the hub mount of the wheel. It can also be used on the barrel when the wheel barrel tool is too thick to fit between surfaces.\n\nIf you have run out of time at this point, rinse the wheels and reapply for further cleaning. If you still have time on the clock, move forward with the cleaner that has already been applied.\n\nThe boar's hair brush is great for getting into nooks and crannies on wheels and caliper faces(sides and rear can be used with the tools noted above). Wheel lug recesses can be a pain but with a boar's hair brush you should not have any problems.\n\nFinally, rinse those bad boys off! If you missed spots or the filth was extra heavy, additional treatments may be needed. You should be left with a beautiful wheel when it is all said and done!!\n\nAnd for when you must have the best of the best, get a Modesta wheel coating applied to your wheels! It will make ongoing care even easier and your wheels will be better protected for years to come.\n\nHere's an example of a set of wheels that we protected with a coating years ago. The best practices for cleaning wheels is to use tools but in this video we can see how well they clean up even when not ideally cleaned with tools."}

{"text": "You can easily transform your maps by using a custom image as your point symbol in ArcGIS Online. But did you know that you can create animated point symbols using the same technique?\n\nThere are many image formats out there (JPG, PNG, etc), but the one we are interested in for animated symbols is the GIF (Graphics Interchange Format). GIF files support multiple frames, which is why they appear as animated. By spacing out the timing of multiple images, a GIF comes to life, like in the map above showing graffiti incidents in Minneapolis. So how is this done?\n\nOverall, the process is easy:\n\n1) Find/create the GIF you want\n\n2) Host the GIF\n\n3) Use it as your point symbol\n\nFor example, the maps used within the Broken Arrows Story Map (seen above) show nuclear weapon accidents by using a point symbol which looks like a detonation. My coworker created this GIF symbol by using Adobe Photoshop. She used the timeline window, where each component of the GIF exists as its own layer. After applying some keyframe manipulations and transformations, the GIF and its loop were created using the save for web option.\n\nAnother example, created by yours truly, is this 2017 NFL Wins/Losses map where the football symbol shows the week-by-week wins and losses of each NFL team. Winning teams smile with pride, losing teams cry of shame, and the bye weeks are resting soundly.\n\nSince I don't have Photoshop, I created these symbols using PowerPoint. I used basic shapes, curves, and ovals to create the little football faces. For each emotion, I created two versions of the facial expression, and saved each one as its own image. I then used the free website ezgif to transform the two images into a moving animation.\n\nThe key to creating your own is to make sure the background of each image is transparent, or you end up getting a white box around your final GIF. To avoid this, save each image using the PNG format in order to preserve transparency.\n\nOnce you have your GIF, you're almost there! This blog explains exactly how to use a custom image as a point symbol in your maps, where all you need is the URL of your image. I use imgur to host my GIFs because it is free and easy to use, but there are many others that can also be used, so use your favorite! Some examples include Flickr, Dropbox, Google Photos, TinyPic, and many others.\n\nOnce hosted, use the URL of the image as your point symbol in ArcGIS Online. Make sure the URL contains \".gif\" at the end!\n\nHave fun with this technique, but be careful not to create too much movement on the map. You don't want your map audience to become dizzy! Keep it simple, and use animation to emphasize a particular action or event.\n\nHappy Mapping!"}

{"text": "Advocates prepare for vote to remove amendment on House floor\n\nWCL News — Normally the House Appropriations Committee tries to rein in government spending, but on June 25, 2014 it passed an amendment to the 2015 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill intended to force the District of Columbia to continue wasting money on marijuana prohibition.\n\nThe bill is an attack on democracy and local control as it seeks to block Washington DC officials from implementing its recently passed law decriminalizing the possession of marijuana in the nation's capitol. It also has the chilling potential to end the District's medical marijuana program. The amendment, offered by Rep. Andy Harris (R-MD), passed by a vote of 28-21.\n\nApparently the Republican lawmaker is determined to preserve Big Government and fiscal waste as the legacy of his term in office to prop up the Drug War budget, a position that even most Tea Party extremists no longer support.\n\nThe District of Columbia City Council passed a law in March 2014 replacing its criminal penalties for possession of less than an ounce of marijuana with a nominal $25 fine, saving money, reducing racial disparities and bringing much-needed revenue to the city's coffers. The policy is scheduled to take effect July 17, a timeline that is now in doubt. The law was largely a response to an ACLU report showing that prohibition is discriminatory in that blacks in the District of Columbia are roughly eight times more likely to be arrested for marijuana than whites, despite similar use rates.\n\nThe District's medical marijuana law is the product of a 1998 initiative. It was not implemented until 2010 due to a provision in federal law, similar to the amendment offered by Rep. Harris, which was not repealed until 2009.\n\nThe full House of Representatives passed an amendment on May 30 aimed at preventing the Department of Justice from enforcing federal law against patients and providers in compliance with state medical marijuana laws. The Marijuana Policy Project and other advocates will seek a floor vote to remove this amendment from the bill when it proceeds to the House floor.\n\n\"The District of Columbia wisely decided to use stop wasting its own resources enforcing ineffective and racially biased laws and to allow those with serious illnesses whose doctors recommend it to use medical marijuana,\" said Federal Policies Director Dan Riffle of the Marijuana Policy Project. \"Unfortunately, unlike every state in America that gets to determine its own laws, Washington, DC laws are reviewed by Congress where Washington, DC residents have no voting representatives.\n\n\"Marijuana is significantly less harmful than alcohol, and polls clearly show most Americans want to see it treated that way. We'll do everything we can to restore democracy in DC and ensure this regressive amendment is rejected when it is considered by the full House. Mr. Harris's antiquated, unscientific views on marijuana should be his constituents' problem, not the District of Columbia's.\"\n\nThe Marijuana Policy Project, the nation's largest marijuana policy organization, has been responsible for changing most state-level marijuana laws since 2000. — West Coast Leaf News Service"}
{"text": "Let me just start by saying that this beautiful braid is a product of a sweet friend I've made through blogging. Over the past many months, I've become friends with Eliane (and yes that's spelled correctly!) from Peppinas Hair on Facebook.\n\nShe too, has little girls and loves trying out different hairstyles and sharing them on her Facebook page. A while back she sent me some pictures of a fun new fishbone braid she'd come up with and wanted me to make a video of it. I've got to admit it took me a while to get it to look like I wanted it to – despite her detailed instructions! It's not really hard, but for whatever reason it didn't turn out quite like hers. I've come to the decision it's because of the amount of hair I was working with on Bee's ponytail vs. using a smaller amount of hair.\n\nThat being said, this video is to just show you the technique. You can do this anywhere on the head – not just a ponytail, and you can use any amount of hair to do it. I think if you work with less hair, you get an even cooler look.\n\n\nOnce you've watched the video and you try this, play around with it a bit to see what works best for you. Plait 4, 6 or even 8 sections and then twist it to see how it looks. Depending on the amount of hair you are working with will also change the look of the twist.\n\nThe next 3 pictures are courtesy of Eliane of Peppinas Hair showing a couple different styles she made using this fun new fishbone braid.\n\nIf you use smaller amounts of hair like she does below, it gives it a whole different look.\n\nStep 1 – Make a ponytail\n\nStep 2 – Divide hair into 2 sections\n\nStep 3 – Start plaiting a regular fishbone braid\n\nYou can do 4-8 plaits at this point. Play around with this and do what you think looks best with the amount of hair you're working with.\n\nStep 4 – Turn the entire braid 180 degrees to the right\n\nStep 5 – Plait an inverse fishbone braid\n\nIf you don't know how to do that, you'll just be taking hair and passing it under the braid instead of over. Do another 4-8 plaits inverted.\n\nStep 6 – Turn or rotate the braid 180 degrees to the right again\n\nStep 7 – Repeat Steps 3-6 until you reach the end of the ponytail\n\nStep 8 – Secure the end with an elastic\n\nLet us know what you think. This is definitely one we will be incorporating into some fun new styles in the future. And a huge thank you to Eliane for sharing her technique with us so we could share it with you.

{"text": "Payday credits can help anyone in times of acute financial needs when there are no other choices available to get cash. In most cases, they are known as high rate loans but they can provide money in urgent situations, which makes them very popular among some segment of lenders.\n\nUnlike other bank loans, online payday loans instant approval are typically approved in a short period, and cash then credited to your bank pocket that you provide. They are known for high approval rates compared to the typical loans.\n\nBut the approval rates do not mean a specific frequency and not everyone gets the approval some are rejected. How do you go about to avoid your request being rejected? And what can you do to increase the chances of being approved? Here are some tips you should consider to improve your approval chances.\n\nGive accurate income report\n\nMany payday companies require some minimum income report for your request to be considered. Some lenders prefer that you should have at least some cash from steady contracts. Many lenders can also ask the company you are working in to prove that your papers are right. If, in any case, they notice or spot any forged or false information, your request will not qualify for a payday loan.\n\nMany people think that giving an overstated income report makes them credible for a loan. Trust me. It will only increase your chance of rejections. Make sure that you don't give wrong information about your monthly income on your loan request.\n\nCheck the credit-to-income ratio\n\nBefore you apply for a loan, it is wise to compare your monthly income with the amount you are requesting. For instance, if you earn ten dollars per month, make sure you apply something less than ten dollars. Many companies approve loan request that is less than your monthly income to avoid bad debt. Remember the lower the amount, the higher the chances of approval. So consider requesting lower sums. It is better to have the half than none at all, they say.\n\nMake sure your credit score is good\n\nMany lenders frequently run credit forms in every potential client even if they usually display some credit scores, which in standard case do not matter. Therefore, pay heed to your credit records. The higher the credit score you attain, the higher the approval rate. Before you apply, make sure you score more than 700, which is a fair score required by any leader. When it comes to payday, credit scores do not matter a lot but the point is, a good score give you an advantage.\n\nPresent the required papers on time\n\nThe loan approval process can be halted or delayed if you submit your papers on time. Also, your application can be considered and approved if you present your papers on time. Everyone like a person who is timely and reliable,and the same applies to payday borrowers. Make sure that you read very carefully all instruction from the borrower and attach every document as directed by the company. Doing this will not only increase your chances but also give you a guarantee of getting the loan."}

Except for her usual stubbornness on releasing the Goldman Sachs speech transcripts, there were no stumbles for Clinton. Hillary Clinton gave her usual solid performance. Clinton doesn't make mistakes and beat herself in these debates. Clinton's message has played better in closed Democratic primaries and in states with more diverse populations.\n\nClinton said nothing in this debate that should cost her votes with the Democratic electorate or put her odds of victory in New York in jeopardy. The Democratic candidates are clearly tired of each other, and the tense tone of the campaign was clearly visible during the debate. Hillary Clinton has been consistently strong in the Democratic debates, and Sen. Sanders was unable to knock her off of her game.\n\nClinton was able to broaden the conversation towards November while discussing Social Security and scored major points by discussing the fact that candidates have not gotten a single question on a woman's right to choose in eight debates.\n\nHillary Clinton came into the New York debate leading, and she will likely exit the debate still well ahead in the Empire State.\n\n\nLosers:\n\n1). Bernie Sanders – Bernie Sanders needed a game-changing debate performance, and too many of his answers were based on his stump speeches. Sanders continued to struggle on guns. Bernie Sanders couldn't provide a straight answer on how he would release hundreds of thousands of prisoners to keep his promise on reducing the prison population. Sanders offered up a vague answer of working with the states, which is fine unless the states don't want to work with him.\n\nThere was nothing in this debate that shifted the dynamic of the New York primary. Sanders needed to appeal to Democratic primary voters, but his answers remained tailored for Independents. Bernie Sanders didn't have a bad debate, but his performance was just like all of his previous performances. Sen. Sanders drew groans from the crowd when he said that he would withdraw the nomination of President Obama's Supreme Court nominee, and it is unclear how his answer will play with Democratic voter in the closed primaries. Sanders was more confrontational, but being more aggressive while offering many of the same answers that he has been using for months likely wasn't enough to cut into Hillary Clinton's double-digit New York lead.\n\n2). Democratic Voters – It is clear that this was a debate that Bernie Sanders pushed for, but it wasn't really necessary. The Democratic primary electorate is tired. Clinton has a big delegate lead, and it would take a string of miracle upsets for Bernie Sanders to catch up to her. Clinton and Sanders delivered a strong debate, but except for Clinton saying that she would sign a $15/hour minimum wage bill as president, there was little new said by both candidates during the debate."}

About 1,500 of those jobs could come to the Interstate 4 corridor.\n\nTALLAHASSEE — Amazon will bring 3,000 jobs to the state in a deal that also means Floridians will have to start paying taxes on purchases from the online retailer.\n\nIt is unclear when Florida residents will have to start paying taxes on Amazon purchases, but it could be as early as next spring.\n\nScott was vague on most details of the deal, such as where distribution centers or offices for the company might be built or how much tax-incentive cash would be required to close the deal.\n\nAn Amazon spokesman would not give further details Thursday. But a source with knowledge of the negotiations said the company plans to build two 1 million-square-foot \"fulfillment centers\" somewhere along the I-4 corridor within the first year of the deal, adding at least 1,500 jobs. The company could eventually add an additional two to four centers in other parts of the state.\n\n\"Amazon will continue to work with Enterprise Florida on its ongoing projects, which will include a return on any taxpayer investment, and we look forward to the company's announcements as it chooses locations and creates jobs in Florida,\" Scott said in the news release.\n\nIt added that Amazon \"will begin collecting Florida sales tax at such time as it is required under current Florida law.\"\n\nThe announcement comes months after Florida broke off negotiations with the Seattle-based retail giant over when it would have to start collecting Florida's 6 percent sales tax.\n\nLawmakers have considered bills to require online retailers to pay taxes in recent legislative sessions, and so has Congress. The question may now be moot relative to Amazon, because it is likely to begin collecting taxes by next spring once its first warehouses open, according to sources familiar with the negotiations who asked not to be identified.\n\nNeither the Governor's Office nor the state's jobs agency, Enterprise Florida, could say specifically when the warehouses would open, and that \"the availability of economic development incentives will be a material factor in any final location decisions.\"\n\nAs soon as Amazon has a presence in the state, that should trigger collection of sales tax unless the Department of Revenue has approved a delay, said John Fleming, a spokesman for the Florida Retail Federation. The department could not be reached for comment Thursday.\n\nBricks-and-mortar retailers have pushed for legislation allowing Florida to collect sales taxes from online retailers regardless of whether they have a physical presence here.

{"text": "What is Anesthesia Detox?\n\nIt is vital to have a clear understanding of what anesthesia-assisted detoxification is and the differences between rapid detox centers. Anesthesia Detox methods use opioid antagonist medications to shorten the duration of acute withdrawal to a period of minutes instead of several days or weeks. Furthermore, while under anesthesia the patient is not subject to discomfort or relapse. When the patient awakens, detoxification is complete and yet there is no awareness of experiencing the severe withdrawal syndrome. Physical craving is blocked, and oral naltrexone can be initiated to reduce the risk of relapse. Rapid detoxification under anesthesia has assisted thousands of patients to achieve freedom from opioid addiction.\n\nRapid Detox started in the late 1970's when doctors began writing about their work with anesthesia detox protocols. Since its first report in the late 70's, detoxification under anesthesia has gained tremendous popularity. Prominent physicians in this exciting and promising field of pharmacology and addiction medicine include Dr. Kebler, Dr. Loimer, Dr. Resnick, and Dr. Legarda. Their remarkable and revolutionary work has allowed thousands of patients to complete detoxification from opiates in a safe, efficient and humane manner.\n\nHow does it Work?\n\nAnesthesia Detox uses an infusion of FDA-approved medications including sedatives and antagonists. These intravenous medications quickly induce withdrawal and remove the opioids from the receptors while the patient is under sedation. The process takes place in an ICU of a hospital and lasts approximately 30 to 90 minutes. Throughout the detox process, a board-certified anesthesiologist and his team monitor patients' vital signs to ensure stability and that the withdrawal is proceeding successfully.\n\nIs Detoxification under Anesthesia Safe?\n\nThe Waismann Method® has performed thousands of successful anesthesia detox for nearly two decades. When physicians provide anesthesia assisted opiate detox responsibly, the results are astounding. The positive results achieved with anesthesia assisted opioid detox are much higher than with the traditional methods of detoxification. This protocol significantly reduces the length of withdrawal symptoms, along with the severity of the symptoms. The sedation of the patient allows for most of the severe discomfort associated with an opioid withdrawal syndrome to be overcome while the patient is unconscious. This results in a higher success rate. An experienced anesthesiologist should perform the anesthesia detox in a full-service hospital. A hospital provides patients with additional medical specialists that can accurately assess and assist in each case.\n\nTreatment centers should tailor treatment protocols based on patients' unique history and conditions. One detox technique should never offer to everyone and anesthesia assisted detox is no exception to this rule. Additional detox options should be available based on each individual's needs. Medical resources must be abundant. There should be no pre-set time or urgency to discharge. Additionally, detox centers should treat patients in private rooms, allowing for undivided attention and individualized medical care. Following these basic rules maximizes rapid detox safety and ensures the comfort of the patient."}

If party lines hold the same weight they did last year when a similar bill died then the bill may be short-lived, but Colorado's legislature this year has exhibited some surprises.\n\nThe bill has already passed three Republican-led House committees with the help of one Republican vote to propel it forward. By comparison, last year's civil unions bill died in its first committee hearing on a party-line vote.\n\nMonday afternoon State House Speaker Frank McNulty, R-Highlands Ranch assigned the civil unions bill to the House State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee where it is being widely speculated it will die. There are nine members on the committee, three of whom have already voted \"no\" upon hearing the bill in committees last week.\n\nOn the second to last day of the session, Republicans denied they were filibustering but never got to the bill.\n\nFrom the Colorado Independent:\n\nRepublicans had been denying for hours that they were filibustering, even as Rep. Bob Gardner, R-Colorado Springs, read whole sections of text into the record, calling out punctuation marks, and Rep. David Balmer, R-Centennial, railed theatrically about how school lunch regulations amounted to a step on the road to Nazism. \"Why, you ask, why do I go on like this about a small amendment?\" Gardner said winkingly at one point during a speech on the school lunch bill. \"Because it's a small amendment but a large issue.\"\n\nFor its fourth committee hearing, the bill will again need just one Republican vote to make it to the House floor where House Democratic leader Mark Ferrandino estimates it will pass with between six to 10 Republican votes.\n\n\"Gov. Hickenlooper's special session will not result in one more job being created, or making gasoline any cheaper,\" McNulty told reporters before the start of the special session. \"Unlike President Obama, Gov. Hickenlooper and their campaign operatives, Colorado families aren't preoccupied with promoting a divisive social agenda -- because they have more pressing concerns.\"\n\nDuring his address, McNulty again chose to call the bill \"same-sex marriage\" rather than \"civil unions.\"\n\nMcNulty also said that he assigned the bill to the State Veterans and Military Affairs Committee to push the special session to end Wednesday, alleging that the governor is spending taxpayer dollars on a President Barack Obama-backed \"campaign stunt.\"\n\nFerrandino, however, is calling it a \"kill committee.\"\n\n\"The majority, including 46 percent of Republican delegates to the party convention this year have supported this bill.

{"text": "Researchers using brain scans have found new evidence that biology—and not environment—is at the core of sexual orientation. Scientists at the Stockholm Brain Institute in Sweden report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA that gay men and straight women share similar traits—most notably in the size of their brains and the activity of the amygdala—an area of the brain tied to emotion, anxiety and aggression. The same is true for heterosexual men and lesbians.\n\n\nStudy author, neurologist Ivanka Savic–Berglund, says such characteristics would develop in the womb or in early infancy, meaning that psychological or environmental factors played little or no role.\n\n\n\"This is yet another in a long series of observations showing there's a biological reason for sexual orientation,\" says Dean Hamer, a molecular biologist at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), who was not involved in the study. \"It's not just a reflection of people's behavior, nor is it a choice, nor is it something in their rearing environment. [The study] shows that it's something that people are born with.\"\n\n\nPrevious studies have examined brain differences between gay and straight people on the basis of their responses to various tasks, such as rating the attractiveness of other people. The problem was that there was no way to determine whether their responses were colored by learned social cues.\n\n\nTo get around this, Savic-Berglund focused on the structure and function of brain regions that develop during fetal development or early infancy—without using any cognitive tasks or rating systems.\n\n\nThe researchers used MRIs to determine the volume and shapes of the brains of 90 volunteers—25 straight and 20 gay members of each sex. They found that the straight men and gay women had asymmetrical brains; that is, the cerebrum (the largest part of the brain, which is responsible for thought, sensory processing, movement and planning) was larger on the right hemisphere of the brain than on the left. In contrast, they found that women and gay men had symmetrical cerebrums.\n\n\nThe team next used PET (positron emission tomography) scans to measure the blood flow to the amygdala, that part of the brain controlling emotion, fear and aggression. The images showed how the amygdala connects to other parts of the brain, giving them clues as to how this might influence behavior. They scanned subjects' brains when they at rest and did not show them photos or introduce other behavior that might have been learned.\n\n\nThey found that in gay men and women, the blood flowed to areas involved in fear and anxiety, whereas in straight men and lesbians it tended to flow to pockets linked to aggression.\n\n\nRobert Epstein, emeritus director of the Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies in Concord, Mass., agrees that the study offers compelling evidence that sexual orientation is a biologically fixed characteristic. But he cautions that these findings may vary in different people whose sexual orientation is not that clear-cut, which his own research shows includes a majority of the population."}

(Photo by Stephen Lovekin/Getty Images for Comedy Central)\n\nLet it be known that Broad City star Abbi Jacobson remembers her roots. Sort of.\n\nThe Pennsylvania native called into Preston & Steve today to talk, among other things, the success of Broad City, growing up on the 'tough streets' of Wayne, and, of course, Jacobson's own love for the Conestoga High School hockey team.\n\n\"I love that you mentioned the tough streets of Wayne,\" Jacobson, a 2002 Conestoga grad, told the morning show's crew. \"It was very tough.\"\n\nWhat's tougher for the Broad City star, though, seems to be remembering the brother of crew member Nick McIlwain, Josh McIlwain, who apparently had a crush on Jacobson way back in their high school days when he was a star hockey player for Conestoga. Judging by Jacobson's response, that crush went entirely unnoticed.\n\n\"This is a lot of pressure right now,\" she said. \"I had no idea he had a crush on me. I think I remember who he is, yeah. I was a big hockey fan, and I'd go to all the hockey games.\"\n\nIn fact, Jacobson loved Conestoga hockey so much that she joined a fan club that existed at the time called simply \"The Hockey Club,\" or THC. Which, of course, only makes sense, given the level of expert stoner humor with which Broad City is replete.\n\nHockey fan or not, however, Josh McIlwain, a 2001 Conestoga grad, now counts himself as a happily married man, and thus is off the market — a fact that Jacobson seemed fully ready to ignore.\n\n\"I think I remember him. And you know what? I think now I'm going to break up that marriage,\" she joked.\n\nThe next episode of Broad City airs tonight at 10:30 on Comedy Central. But that's not all for Jacobson and co-star Ilana Glazer this week: The comedy duo will stop by The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Friday. As Preston & Steve suggested to conclude the interview, tune in and \"support local performers.\"\n\nOdds are Josh McIlwain will be, anyway. Check out the full interview here.\n\n[WMMR]"}
{"text": "My ex-husband had treatment resistant depression (meaning that after over 2 or 3 years of trying, no medication or other therapy had helped). In May, he started to have hallucinations and paranoia, and there was nothing I or anyone else could do. Eventually, he decided to take all of my social security disability money and leave with the car. He left behind a mountain of debt (for someone on disability) that he had hidden from me. There was a tax debt, a second credit card, and unpaid utilities and car payments in my name (but that weren't actually my debts). Some of them, his sister and attorneys got him to pay for. But I still had to put about $3000 on a credit card so that I wouldn't have my utilities shut off, etc. I still ended up homeless for a month (sleeping in an RV) because of all of this, but now I'm back in an apartment and working on getting back on my feet. But the debt he left me - putting it on the credit card where there's interest - is killing me. He's legally been ordered to repay me, but he hasn't actually done so yet and there's doubts that he ever will. I only have $8000 in credit and what I get from social security disability every month (they had to find a new, secure way to send it to me after he stole about a month's worth). Without his repayment, I'm in real trouble. I may not be able to pay for food, utilities, my medical bills (including food and medication for my service dog), etc. If anyone out there has the means to help with what's a pretty small amount for most people, I could really use it. I just need enough to where putting $500/month on the credit card is enough to actually get me out of the debts he left behind. $6000 is about what's on there, but if I could at least cut that in half ($3000), I can catch up. I know it's not your debt. It's not even mine. Really, he should be repaying it and the law even agrees, but he may never do so and even if he does, interest and bills may max out that card and leave me homeless again. Any help at all (no matter how big or small) is appreciated.\n\n\nAnd even if you can't make a direct monetary donation here, I could use 1-800-PetMeds or Petsmart gift cards (her medication is about $100/month and her food is about $50 / 2 months), or Walmart gift cards (to cover food, cleaning supplies, personal hygiene products, etc). Those would help me to not have to put any more money on the card until his debts are off of it. On my own, I can manage quite well, but his debts are killing me. Please help me just to get back on my feet. I'm sorry to ask, but thank you.\n\nShare Tweet 12 shares on Facebook shares on Facebook"}

{"text": "Photo\n\nNEW DELHI — The death toll from the collapse of a building near Mumbai rose to at least 72 people on Saturday, two days after the disaster that underscored the prevalence of illegal and shoddy construction ending in disaster.\n\nRescuers worked into Saturday pulling bodies from the rubble in Thane. The Associated Press reported one women was pulled from the rubble after 36 hours.\n\n\nPhoto\n\nThe high death toll was partly a reflection of how construction workers and their families often live in crude shacks at construction sites, exposing women and children to significant risks.\n\n\"Illegal construction is a major problem in the Thane area,\" said Sandeep Malvi, public relations officer of Thane Municipal Corporation. \"Each time we demolish a building, someone builds again. We demolish it, and they build.\"\n\nThe price of land in many Indian cities has grown so high that contractors routinely build on public property – sometimes after bribing public officials. If enough buildings are built in a particular area and enough time passes, these makeshift settlements become politically impossible to demolish.\n\nThe collapsed building in Thane was built on protected forest land, according to Mr. Malvi. And because of the uncertainty surrounding the fate of such buildings, the quality of the construction is often very poor.\n\n\"Because these buildings come up so quickly, the quality is always very bad,\" Mr. Malvi said.\n\nPhoto\n\nLocal police officials have filed murder charges against the builders, who have yet to be found.\n\nBuilding collapses aren't unusual in India because of unsafe and illegal constructions tacked onto structures. In 2010, a five-story tenement collapsed in New Delhi, killing at least 64 people, mostly migrant workers.\n\nA government study, published in 1998, noted that, \"The number of unsafe buildings is increasing every day.\"\n\nThe problem is not a lack of construction standards, just an indifference to them, the study concluded.\n\nBut even high-quality construction projects defy contracting norms that are enforced in places like the United States. For instance, New Delhi bans large cement trucks from entering much of the city during the day. The result is that concrete for even very large homes is often made in a batch process on site, which can result in substandard buildings with significant structural flaws.\n\nIndian cities are being flooded with migrants from rural areas for which few cities are providing any kind of planning or infrastructure. The result is vast slums and illegal construction. A recent survey found that more than 17 percent of Indian households live in slums that are considered unlivable by the Indian government. In greater Mumbai, the share of people living in such slums is 41 percent.\n\nWhen such a large share of the population lives in such destitute circumstances, illegal construction — even with its inherent risks — becomes a welcome alternative for millions of people.\n\nSruthi Gottipati contributed reporting from Delhi and Neha Thirani from Mumbai."}

Shkreli has gained a reputation for being a provocateur, seeming to revel in the notoriety he gained after increasing the price on the AIDS drug Daraprim to $750 per pill from $13.50 per pill.\n\nHe has since gained a reputation as a so-called \"troll,\" and even registered domains in the names of journalists who covered him and then using those sites to mock them. As Mashable noted, Shkreli has been in trouble before for his online harassment of critics and was even kicked off Twitter after violating the platform's harassment policy in an attack on Teen Vogue editor Lauren Duca.\n\nnull\n\nShkreli was also recently convicted of securities fraud for lying to hedge-fund investors about a pharmaceutical drug.\n\nnull\n\nMartin Shkreli has also been known to push conspiracy theories, including those connected to Hillary Clinton. Earlier this summer he offered $100,000 for information that led to the arrest of the killer of Seth Rich, a staff member of the Democratic National Committee shot to death in 2016.

In 2002 he started the \"Gettysburg\" trilogy with Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich; the trilogy consists of Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War, Grant Comes East, and Never Call Retreat: Lee and Grant - The Final Victory. More recently, they have have published two works on the events leading up to Pearl Harbor and immediately after that attack Pearl Harbor, and Days of Infamy.In March 2009, Forstchen's latest work, One Second After, (Forge/St. Martin's books) was released. Based upon several years of intensive research and interviews, it examines what might happen in a \"typical\" American town in the wake of an attack on the United States with \"electro-magnetic pulse\" (EMP) weapons. Similar in plotting to books such as On the Beach and Alas Babylon, One Second After, is set in a small college town in western North Carolina and is a cautionary tale of the collapse of social order in the wake of an EMP strike. The book has been optioned by Warner Bros. and currently is in development as a feature film. The book was cited on the floor of Congress and before the House Armed Services Committee by Congressman Roscoe Bartlett (R.-MD), chair of the House Committee tasked to evaluate EMP weapons, as a realistical portrayal of the potential damage rendered by an EMP attack on the continental United States.Forstchen resides near Asheville, North Carolina with his daughter Meghan. His other interests include archaeology, and he has participated in several expeditions to Mongolia and Russia. He is a pilot and co owns an original 1943 Aeronca L-3B recon plane used in World War II."}

The highlight: plans for a line of smartphones starting at $25 each, bringing HTML5-powered smartphones to billions of people who can't afford more expensive devices.\n\nCentral to this plan is a partnership with Chinese fabless semiconductor designer Spreadtrum. The company has designed a trio of chipsets built around the ARM Cortex A5 processor.\n\nWhile a $25 smartphone might be a step down from the high-powered phones of Samsung and Apple, Mozilla is positioning its new products at an audience that currently only has feature phones. As such, it's not a step down, it's a step up.\n\n2014 will bring a wide expansion in the number and availability of Firefox OS handsets on the market. Alcatel and ZTE are both expanding their range of Firefox OS phones from the single models they each currently sell. Alcatel will have three new handsets, ranging from the low- to mid-range. The highest specced, the One Touch Fire S, will include a 1.2GHz quad core processor and a 4.5 inch 960×540 screen, and the lowest, the One Touch Fire C, will have a 1.2 GHz dual core processor and a 3.5 inch 480×320 screen.\n\nZTE is also launching a pair of phones, both at the lower end of the market, with 1.2 GHz dual core processors, and either a 4 inch 800×480 screen or a 3.5 inch 480×320 screen.\n\nHuawei is a newcomer to Firefox OS, launching a handset called the Ascend Y300.\n\nAlcatel\n\nAlcatel\n\nAlcatel\n\nAlcatel\n\nHuawei\n\nZTE\n\nZTE\n\nFirefox OS is also going to launch on tablets. Mozilla and hardware companies have put together a pair of tablet reference designs, a 7 inch design from VIA and a 10 inch design from Foxconn. Alcatel went a step further and announced the One Touch Fire 7, with a 7 inch 960×540 screen and 1.2GHz dual core processor.\n\nTo help push Firefox OS up more toward the mid-range, Mozilla is also producing a developer reference model, the Flame, with a 1.2GHz dual core processor and a 4.5 inch 854×480 screen. Being a developer model, this has a unique developer-focused feature: the amount of RAM usable will be adjustable from 256 to 1024MB, so that devs can see how their apps perform with different memory configurations.\n\n\nFirefox OS will also get some software updates this year to introduce a slightly new look and feel. Mozilla also announced integration with PhoneGap/Apache Cordova to make it easy for devs to convert HTML5 content into apps. Google has similarly launched a beta of PhoneGap integration in Chrome on Android, to enable HTML5 apps for Chrome OS to be run on Android."}

It was eventually passed by 138 votes to one.\n\nThe Istanbul convention, created by the Council of Europe, is aimed at preventing violence against women and domestic violence, and has been signed by almost 40 countries.\n\nDavies, who styles himself a champion of men's rights, proposed amendments including that the convention \"be deemed, across the United Kingdom, to apply equally to men and women\".\n\nOther amendments, many of which were also proposed by another Tory MP, David Nuttall, suggested the ratification should lapse if it did not reduce violence against women, and that the UK be exempt from any scrutiny or monitoring on the issue.\n\nGetting up to speak in the House of Commons, Davies – who in December was voted on to parliament's women and equalities committee – began by warning: \"We've actually got quite a large number of new clauses and amendments to go through this morning.\"\n\nHe added: \"I will try and do justice to these amendments, and I will try and do it as quickly as I can.\"\n\nDavies said he opposed the private member's bill, proposed by the SNP's Eilidh Whiteford, which gained support from the government and from nine parties in the Commons. \"I've made it clear that I don't agree with the Istanbul convention, as it is discriminatory,\" he said.\n\nDavies, who in December spoke for more than an hour in the Commons to try to derail a bill to protect women against violence, later withdrew his amendments, so they were not voted on.\n\nHowever, he and a handful of other Conservative MPs forced votes on the measure – formally called the preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (ratification of convention) bill – as well as on a series of government amendments, causing more delays.\n\nDavies's tactics brought condemnation from a series of other MPs. SNP MP John Nicholson tweeted during the speech:\n\nJOHN NICOLSON M.P. (@MrJohnNicolson) The absurd Philip Davies has been on his feet filibustering now for 1 hr 20mins on the @EilidhWhiteford bill.

And-and I know that sounds– you know– you know what it sounds like,\" President Obama said in response to a question about whether he thinks Republicans are happy with their nominee. \"You want the Republican nominee to be somebody who could do the job if they win. And you want folks who understand the issues. And where you can sit across the table from them and you have a principled argument. And ultimately can still move the country forward.\"\n\nPresident Obama has been increasingly critical of Trump as the primary season ticks on, though he seldom mentions the presumptive nominee by name. The President, reports say, is eagerly awaiting an opportunity to stump for the Democratic nominee so he can lambast Trump further. On the Tonight Show, Obama said he has been pained by the actions of Republicans over the past seven years, but he believes they're ultimately good people.\n\n\"There are wonderful Republicans out in the country who want what's best for the country and may disagree with me on some things but are good, decent people,\" Obama told Fallon. \"But what's happened in that party culminating in this current nomination, I think is not actually good for the country as a whole. It's not something Democrats should wish for.\"\n\nThe President's comments come in the wake of widespread backlash aimed at the presumptive GOP nominee, who has questioned whether a judge in a lawsuit against Trump University can be unbiased due to his Mexican heritage. When pressed, Trump also said he did not think a Muslim judge could be unbiased against him given his controversial policy proposal to ban the immigration of Muslims.\n\nObama's statements on the Tonight Show also came just one day after his former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was named the presumptive nominee of the Democratic party. The President has not yet publicly endorsed Clinton, though the White House has indicated it could happen in the future. Obama is scheduled to meet with Sen. Bernie Sanders at the White House on Thursday; White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday a formal endorsement likely would not come before then.\n\nObama told Fallon that he thinks the Democratic primary has been good for the party. \"It was a healthy thing for the Democratic Party to have– a contested primary,\" Obama said. \"I thought that Bernie Sanders brought enormous energy and new ideas. And he pushed the party and challenged them. I thought it made Hillary a better candidate.\"\n\nHe added that he hopes the candidates will be able to smooth over the \"ouchies\" they experienced during the campaign. \"This is about the country and the direction we're gonna take it,\" Obama said. \"And I think we're gonna have a great convention and we'll do well.\""}

If I'm going to a friend's house, I have to ask them to turn the Wi-Fi off,\" she said.\n\nCampbell claims her condition causes her to become lightheaded when exposed to wireless devices.\n\nA two-hour trip into the city can leave her fatigued for the rest of the day. Campbell avoids restaurants, coffee shops, movie theatres and anywhere she expects exposure.\n\nThe situation impelled Campbell to call on B.C.

The management contract for the project is to be awarded by the end of this year, according to the the RFP, which notes that the dates are subject to change.\n\nProponents of the project say it would provide a one-seat mass transit link between the airport and the heart of the metropolitan area it serves, an amenity that has come to be expected by frequent fliers.\n\nPlanners and transit advocates say a PATH airport extension would also provide a convenient and affordable commuting option for airport workers in Hudson and Essex counties as well as New York. Environmentalists have embraced the project as a means of reducing automobile traffic.\n\nSupport dates back at least to the late 1970's, when an advisory panel recommended the link. The Port Authority commissioned a study that recommended the project in 2012, and it was included in the agency's current $27.6 billion 10-year capital plan adopted in February, though without a specific time frame.\n\nA Port Authority spokesman, Steve Coleman, confirmed that Friday's RFP was the first document to lay out a schedule for the project, but cautioned that the dates were not set in stone. Proponents nonetheless welcomed word that construction was now at least tentatively scheduled to begin.\n\n\n\"21st Century transportation is vital if we're going to compete with major airports around the country and the globe,\" said Joe Sitt, chaiman of the Global Gateway Alliance, an airport advocacy group. \"So we're glad to see the Port Authority putting concrete milestones on the table toward making a one-seat ride from the World Trade Center PATH to Newark Airport a reality.\"\n\nThe extension is to run from the PATH's western terminus at Newark Penn Station, along an existing Northeast Corridor right of way used by Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains. NJ Transit already provides heavy rail service between Newark Penn and Newark Liberty via a station on the Northeast Corridor linked to the air terminals and other areas by the airport monorail.\n\nThe PATH extension would be largely redundant, following the same route and using the same monorail link. But riders could continue on PATH trains from Newark Penn on to Harrison, Jersey City stops at Journal Square, Grove Street and Exchange Place and at the World Trade Center in Manhattan. With a single transfer, PATH riders from Hoboken or Manhattan's West Side could also reach the airport, albeit in a two-seat ride.\n\nSteve Strunsky may be reached at sstrunsky@njadvancemedia.com.

{"text": "We can forget about fixing the planet's ecosystems and climate until we have fixed government systems, a panel of leading international environmental scientists declared in London on Friday. The solution, they said, may not lie with governments at all.\n\n\"We are disillusioned. The current political system is broken,\" said Bob Watson, the UK government's chief environmental science advisor, who chaired the meeting.\n\nThe panel, all winners of the prestigious Blue Planet prize, often seen as the Nobel prize for environmental science, were meeting to prepare a statement for the Earth Summit 2012, to be held in Rio de Janeiro in June – 20 years after the original Earth Summit in that city.\n\nThe world has wasted the intervening years, the group said. Ecosystems are disappearing ever faster, the world is still warming, and two 1992 treaties, on climate change and species loss, have failed to achieve their aims. Governments, the group said, were largely to blame.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Last time in Rio we had an unreasonable faith in governments. Since then we've lost our innocence in believing government was wise and benevolent and far-sighted. That's been blown completely out of the water,\" said Camilla Toulmin, director of the International Institute for Environment and Development, a non-profit organisation based in London.\n\nNot remotely sustainable\n\n\"Essentially nothing has changed in 20 years. We are not remotely on a course to be sustainable,\" Watson said.\n\n\"What's most discouraging is a loss of feeling that government would help us,\" said Harold Mooney, a veteran biologist from Stanford University.\n\nNo one held out much hope that the forthcoming summit would usher in a new era. Politicians do not seem interested. The 1992 summit lasted two weeks, attracted most of the world's leaders and garnered huge headlines. But this year's event will last just three days, and so far China's president Hu Jintao is the only head of state scheduled to attend.\n\n\"The UN text [for the summit declaration] is weak,\" said energy researcher José Goldemberg, who was Brazil's environment secretary at the time of the first summit.\n\nKey priorities\n\nThe top priorities, according to Watson, are ending the fossil-fuel era to curb climate change, and investing in limiting population by making contraception available to all.\n\nBut neither were likely to happen because, said Syukuro Manabe, a climate modeller at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \"the political system is not motivated to worry about the future\".\n\nThe laureates said leadership was most likely to come from local government, NGOs and corporations, rather than national leaders or the UN. \"Decision-makers should learn from and scale up grass-roots action and knowledge in areas like energy, food, water and natural resources,\" the panel declared.\n\n\"We do believe that the political system can be reformed, and that there will be technical solutions.

It will be making its console debut on PS4! Woo!\n\nWay back in the PSone days, I'd always pick up a copy of the Official PlayStation Magazine for the included demo discs. Every now and then they'd have a special \"import section\" that had untranslated demos of games from Japan that would likely never make their way to the states.\n\nOne of these was a game called Ore no Ryouri, a twin-stick cooking game that had you pouring beers and making foods for customers. It was just a small, timed demo, but it had me hooked.\n\nWell after playing it, the idea of making an insane cooking game kept gnawing away at me. I got into making small games and pursued my passion for game development, but it wasn't until making Cook, Serve, Delicious! that it all clicked together. Finally, my love of food and intense gameplay mechanics were merged into one.\n\n\nStill, I didn't know if that would play to the gaming audience, given that a large majority of cooking games were of the simple, casual variety, and Cook, Serve, Delicious! was very much the opposite of that. In fact it didn't really take off until Ryan Davis of Giantbomb picked it up for a Quick Look video. Since then, the game has inspired hundreds of Let's Play videos and streams for a cumulative total of more than six million views, and has grossed nearly a million across PC and mobile.\n\nCook, Serve, Delicious! 2!! has you rebuilding your own restaurant in a massive skyscraper, earning money by cooking and serving customers delicious food, and building up your restaurant's reputation from a zero star dilapidated café to a five star world famous restaurant.\n\n\nAlong the way you'll jump into other restaurants in the tower for shift work, star in the biggest reality cooking show ever, participate in tournaments all over the world, uncover mysterious ingredients, and tons, tons more. The breakneck pace and gameplay has been a staple of the game, and this game will be even faster and more challenging than ever.\n\nThis is a huge, massive sequel to the first game. Everything is new in this game, from the art by Camille Kuo, to the music by Jonathan Geer, to the large amount of game content, with more than 180 foods, 1,000+ recipes, tons of unlockables and events, and dozens of hours of gameplay. For those who have played the first game, you can look forward to even better gameplay mechanics with all new strategies and components, running at 1080p and 60 frames per second.\n\nI can't wait to launch the game in 2016! Thanks, and if you have any questions I'll be sure to answer them below. Until then, keep cooking deliciously!"}
{"text": "That was true, and essential for American security, until this week. With his barrage of executive orders, Trump is taking America back to the historical nightmares of the world before December 1941: closed borders, limited trade, intolerance to diversity, arms races, and a go-it-alone national race to the bottom. His executive order on \"rebuilding the U.S. armed forces\" calls for \"peace through strength,\" but this document and the others he signed offer nothing but unilateralism and militarization: more military spending, more nuclear weapons, more use of torture (which is illegal), and more promises to destroy ISIS and other terrorist threats. The executive orders promise to curtail American participation in international organizations, prohibit whole categories of foreigners from entering our country, and limit exchanges of ideas and goods. This is not a United States any president from Roosevelt to Reagan would recognize.\n\nCoupled with Trump's decision to withdraw from the Transpacific Partnership trade negotiations, build a \"huge\" wall on the southern border, and impose high tariffs on imports, the United States is left with a foreign policy that cuts it off from the relationships that fueled its growth for 70 years. Where will the markets and brains come from, when America is isolated and reviled? Where will the capital to fund its debt come from, when it is in deep conflict with the countries that buy its bonds (especially China)? And, most significant, how can America anticipate and prevent foreign threats when it gets little help from others? Trump's executive orders are making the United States an international pariah, which raises the costs for every element of its security and economy. Self-absorbed islands never prosper, and they usually decline fast.\n\nThe Trump team seems driven by its perception of enemies more than its analysis of national interests. If the president and his advisers thought seriously about the historical sources of America's strength, they would not be so quick to destroy the liberal world order that it built. They would also think through the implications of the alternative order they are trying to create. It sounds courageous to say the United States will jettison pesky allies who do not \"pay their share\" and shut potential terrorists out of our country, but do those angry actions really serve its interests? Do they make America stronger, safer, and more prosperous? Almost certainly not.\n\nBy signing a series of militaristic executive orders at the Pentagon, Trump is sending a clear message that his definition of the national interest is purely focused on short-term chest-thumping and job hoarding, even as his actions will destroy more jobs in the near and long term. He shows no interest in nurturing a sustainable global economy, a livable planet, or the spread of democracy. The executive orders reveal his deep antagonism to all of these things, and the basic wisdom of American history. His actions are all about appealing to his less-than-majority base of supporters within the United States. He is intent on showing that he is boss, with \"tremendous\" support. The nation be damned."}

He doesn't need to prove himself in every single game, as that only increases the pressure. He should play as he did tonight.\n\n\"I was satisfied with the overall performance, as we covered the pitch well and allowed Genoa nothing. Obviously, when Dybala is the centre-forward, then the box must be filled with runs from the wingers and midfielders.

Even Brosnan himself later argued that it was \"seven times better\" than the official theme.\n\nPet Shop Boys – \"This Must Be The Place I Waited Years To Leave\"\n\nResponsible for one of the more forgettable Bond themes, A-Ha were unfathomably given the nod for 1987's The Living Daylights ahead of the year's most successful pop act, Pet Shop Boys. Later appearing on their 1990 album, Behaviour, the dramatic and far superior synth-pop of \"This Must Be The Place I Waited Years To Leave\" only confirmed that the producers made the wrong call.\n\nBlondie – \"For Your Eyes Only\"\n\nSheena Easton's theme to 1981's For Your Eyes Only may have received both a Golden Globe and Oscar nomination, but it still pales into comparison with Blondie's track of the same name. Debbie Harry and co. were in fact the producers' first choice to open the credits, but were replaced by the future Prince protégé after the band insisted on writing their own song – a suitably moody piece of new wave which eventually appeared on 1982's The Hunter.\n\nPhyllis Hyman – \"Never Say Never Again\"\n\nIntended to introduce Sean Connery's return to the role after a 12-year absence, \"Never Say Never Again\" perfectly bridged the gap between the brassy belters of Shirley Bassey and the smooth soul-pop of Gladys Knight. Sadly, following a dispute with the score's composer Michel Legrand, producers were forced to shelve late Phyllis Hyman's superior theme and give the job to Brazilian singer Lani Hall instead.\n\nJohnny Cash – \"Thunderball\"\n\nAdmittedly, The Man In Black's theme to 1965's Thunderball suggested the James Bond series had took an unexpected turn into Spaghetti Western territory. But the Ennio Morricone-esque trumpets, shuffling country beats and Cash's booming tones would certainly have been preferable to the chosen histrionics of Tom Jones."}

{"text": "But despite having these convictions from an early age, and although she was raised in a Catholic home, her father did not think the convent was the right calling for her. \"He told me I could better make a living working with my hands,\" she recalls. \"I wanted to study agriculture, but that was not possible in the abbey school, so the headmistress asked if I might be interested in the brewery.\"\n\nMallersdorf has been a site for brewing beer since the 12th century. It was originally a monastery housing Benedictine monks, who began producing beer as a safe alternative to drinking unclean water for themselves and for the pilgrims who visited them. The monastery was converted to the current Franciscan convent in 1869, and brewing resumed in 1881.\n\nThe abbey now houses a modern brewery with two large copper boilers, cooling pans, and a storage cellar. Sister Doris began her apprenticeship in 1966, under the careful watch of another sister who had been brewing beer there since 1931. By 1969, Sister Doris had completed a course in brewing beer at a nearby vocational school. \"I had become a master brewer,\" she says. \"Then I decided that I wanted to join the convent, and I took my vows.\"\n\nBrewing is her service to the convent—her assigned profession. \"There are 490 sisters in the abbey,\" she says, \"and some work as teachers in schools, in children's homes, nursing homes. We also have cooks and pig farmers and a baker. We do everything for ourselves.\" Of her own job, Sister Doris says: \"I love the work, and I love the smell when I'm making beer. And I love working with living things—with yeast, barley, and with the people who enjoy the beer.\"\n\nMonastic brewing has existed since the Middle Ages—monasteries undertook the first large-scale production of beer in medieval Europe—but according to Richard Unger, author of Beer in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, there has not been a specific study of the history of nuns and brewing.\n\nIn the secular world, however—particularly when it came to beer for private consumption or small-scale selling—women were the original brewmasters. \"It may well be that since the task was classed with domestic chores it was generally done by women,\" Unger writes in his book. \"But in the high and late Middle Ages, when [brewing] moved from a household industry to a system of [centralized] workshops, you see fewer women brewing.\"\n\nThe number of women making beer may have declined, but in the late Middle Ages women were predominantly the ones selling it in pubs and taverns. Still, \"women who sold beer were long the subject of complaint and even a source for derision,\" according to Unger. \"The operators of taverns were always suspect in northern Europe because of the problems of drunkenness and disorder which the establishments generated, so the women who ran them had bad reputations.\""}
{"text": "\"Record Cleaning Made Difficult\" , Michael Wayne's definitive and fanatical record cleaning article originally published in The Tracking Angle back in the mid '90s includes use of Allsop's no long in production Orbitrac™, which was a pad based cleaning system that fit over the turntable spindle, allowing you to easily rotate it around the record.\n\nAllsop took the original model out of production when vinyl \"died,\" but re-introduced it some years later in a new version that used replaceable cloth cartridges. They were more convenient to swap out than the older system but far more expensive.\n\nAt some point despite growing LP sales, Allsop once again stopped producing and selling the Orbitrac. I had been discussing the re-introduction of the Orbitrac with Brent Allsop, even to the point of offering to buy the rights and manufacture it myself, when Mr. Allsop was tragically killed in an automobile accident.\n\nRecently a U.K. based reader sent me the closest thing to an Orbitrac I've yet seen. It's called a \"HyperBRUSH™\" and it's manufactured in Ireland and marketed by TRACKMate™. Though the company lists a U.S. distributor in Vancouver, WA. I could find no contact information and the product doesn't seem to be distributed in America.\n\nThe utterly clueless company markets a VHS cleaner and other such products on amazon.com but not the HyperBRUSH record cleaner. However, I did find it on Amazon.UK. for £9 (about $18).\n\nIt works similar to the Orbitrac and comes with a record cleaning solution that I didn't try. It also has a stylus cleaning pad that works well and another felt pad atop the cleaner that's not identified for any purpose. In fact the instructions don't identify the stylus cleaning brush and I bet some inexperienced users might use the felt pad instead of the one that's supposed to be used. Of course you won't make that mistake.\n\nThe HyperBRUSH doesn't replace a good wet cleaning system whether the inexpensive Spin Clean or a vacuum machine or the Audio Desk ultrasonic machine. However, the HyperBRUSH is very useful as a pre-clean for really dirty records when used with any of the wet machines so you don't gum up and foul the machine brushes.\n\nThe HyperBRUSH also includes a static reducing strip. Unfortunately the brushes aren't replaceable. The company says washing them with warm soapy water (followed by a very good rinse) will restore them but I've not yet reached that point with the one I've got here. Plus I have the original Orbitrac and enough replacement pads to last a lifetime (thanks to a barter deal with a reader).\n\nOverall, I found the HyperBRUSH convenient to use on the turntable thanks to the over-the-spindle rotating feature and considering the low price, it's a worthwhile tool in one's record cleaning arsenal."}
{"text": "They are very well reasoned pieces by our Ian Bogost: \nPith lines:\n\" We collectively \"decided\" not to fund education in America. Now we're living with the consequences. Lost on those who mount such defenses is the fact that running these online courses costs  more  rather than less money in the short term (Georgia Tech's Coursera faculty are taking on the task on top of their normal work), and doesn't produce any direct revenue for anyone, not even Coursera.\"\n\" Citing enormous enrollment numbers against very small numbers of instructors and instructional support personnel is a common way to justify the promise of MOOCs (\"Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) with 100,000+ students\" is the line in the Snowbird session description). Yet, we also know that these courses also exhibit  very high attrition rates, possibly as high as 97% .\"\n\" If the lecture was such a bad format in the industrial age, why does it suddenly get celebrated once digitized and streamed into a web browser in the information age?\"\n\" The fact that two of the major players in MOOCville are private, VC-funded silicon valley companies co-founded by Stanford professors who've quit their university jobs should offer plain and obvious evidence of what's really going on. Or, as I was recently quoted  an article about MOOCs in Times Higher Education , 'The purpose of a for-profit that is venture-backed in Silicon Valley is to grow as quickly as possible and to exit providing a considerable financial benefit for its investors—and that goal may not be compatible with education.' \"\n\" One night recently, it was raining hard as I drove to pick my son up from an evening class at the Atlanta Ballet. Like many cities, Atlanta's roads are in terrible condition after years of neglect. Lane divider paint is so worn as to become invisible in the wet darkness, potholes litter the pavement. But this time the danger was magnified: on large stretches of Interstates 75 and 85, two major freeways that intersect the city, the streetlights were completely extinguished.\n\"There are ways to fix such dangers. One option would involve allocating public funds to repair and revitalize the infrastructure in question. Of course, such services are difficult in an era of reduced tax revenues and massive public resistance to financial support of infrastructural projects in the first place. So another option might involve hiring private companies -- not to repair the broken roads and streetlamps, but to provide separate paved surfaces and illumination services to those who might choose to drive in conditions of wetness and/or darkness. After all, we're living in an age when traversable roads have become fiscally unviable. What choice do we have?\n\"Such is essentially the logic the state of California has adopted in  its plan to offer online classes in the California State University System , a deal the state has struck with \"massively open online course\" (MOOC) provider  Udacity .\""}

{"text": "To the editor of the N. Y. Tribune.\n\nSir, It is known that the venerable George Washington Parke Custis died some two years ago; and the same papers that announced his death announced also the fact that on his deathbed he liberated his slaves. The will, for some reason, was never allowed any publicity, and the slaves themselves were cajoled along with the idea that some slight necessary arrangements were to be made, when they would all have their free papers. Finally they were told five years must elapse before they could go. Meantime they have been deprived of all means of making a little now and then for themselves, as they were allowed to do during Mr. Custis's life, have been kept harder at work than ever, and part of the time have been cut down to half a peck of unsifted meal a week for each person, without even their fish allowance. Three old women, who have seen nearly their century each, are kept sewing, making clothes for the field hands, from daylight till dark, with nothing but the half-peck of meal to eat; no tea or coffee — nothing that old people crave — and no time given them to earn these little rarities, as formerly. One old man, eighty years old, bent with age, and whom Mr. Custis had long since told had done enough, and might go home and smoke his pipe in peace, is now turned out as a regular field hand. A year ago, for some trifling offense, three were sent to hail, and a few months later three more, for simply going down to the river to get themselves some fish, when they were literally starved. (¶ 1)\n\nSome three or four weeks ago, three, more courageous than the rest, thinking their five years would never come to an end, came to the conclusion to leave for the North. They were most valuable servants, but they were never advertised, and there was no effort made to regain them which looks exceedingly as though Mr. Lee, the present proprietor, knew he had no lawful claim to them. They had not proceeded far before their progress was intercepted by some brute in human form, who suspected them to be fugitives, and probably wished a reward. They were lodged in jail, and frightened into telling where they had started from. Mr. Lee was forthwith acquainted with their whereabouts, when they were transported back, taken into a barn, stripped, and the men received thirty and nine lashes each, from the hands of the slave-whipper, when he refused to whip the girl, and Mr. Lee himself administered the thirty and nine lashes to her. They were then sent to Richmond jail, where they are now lodged. (¶ 2)\n\nNext to Mount Vernon, we associate the Custis place with the Father of this free country. Shall Washington's body guard be thus tampered with, and never a voice raised for such utter helplessness? (¶ 3)\n\nA.\n\nWashington, June 21, 1859."}

(Photo: Elliot Davis, via Sundance Institute)\n\nUPDATE: The Birth of a Nation set a new sales record Tuesday at the Sundance Film Festival, netting a $17.5 million distribution deal from Fox Searchlight. According to Variety and The Hollywood Reporter, an overnight bidding war included escalating offers from The Weinstein Co., Netflix and Paramount.\n\nPARK CITY, Utah — The Birth of a Nation got a standing ovation, and it hadn't even started yet.\n\nMonday afternoon, the crowd rose to salute director/star/writer Nate Parker before it had seen a frame of his slavery drama, which centers its powerful story around a slave rebellion led by Nat Turner in 1831.\n\nThe timing was nothing short of incredible. Diversity discussions had dominated Sundance Film Festival for five days, after the Academy Awards announced all-white acting nominees for the second year in a row.\n\nThen The Birth of a Nation arrived, starkly and thoughtfully excavating the roots of American racism.\n\n\"I made this film for one reason — in the hope of creating change agents,\" said Parker during the film's Q&A. \"You can watch this film and see there are systems that were in place that were corrupt and corrupted people. And the legacy of that still lives with us.\"\n\nBorn a slave in Virginia, Turner was taught to read as a child and grew up to become a preacher. He had an affable relationship with his master, Samuel (Armie Hammer), and was able to marry a slave, Cherry (Aja Naomi King). But slave abuse increased as plantation owners became more paranoid, including an increasingly savage Samuel.\n\nNo longer able to justify their world through Bible verses, Turner ignites a slave rebellion, ultimately leading a 48-hour bloody attack.\n\n\"A labor of love pursued by Parker for seven years, the film vividly captures an assortment of slavery's brutalities while also underlining the religious underpinnings of Turner's justifications for his assaults on slaveholders,\" wrote The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nBirth is \"certain to be the most widely discussed and rousingly received film in the U.S. dramatic competition at Sundance this year,\" Variety said.\n\nOn stage, Parker described most films dealing with slavery in the South as \"desperately sanitized.\" Despite success found by recent films 12 Years a Slave and Django Unchained, he spoke of an ongoing \"resistance to dealing with this material. So when the script goes out, people read it, they say, 'People won't want to see this. Another slave movie? Haven't we seen those?' \"\n\nSo will rapturous applause at Sundance turn into a mega-million distribution deal?

{"text": "It hasn't been a good time to be one of the Bruins starting defenseman.\n\nIn each of the past four games, a defenseman has gone down to injury in the first period. After today's game, here's where the Bruins D men were in terms of regular season ice time (all situations, via stats.hockeyanalysis) and their status. Three of those four injuries were to top four defenseman, and the fourth was to their sixth defenseman.\n\nLet's start with a quick rundown of the potential plays that injured the Bruins defensemen, and the dates\n\nGame 81 vs Ottawa Senators, April 6\n\nTorey Krug - Lower body\n\nDefensemen TOI:\n\nGame 82 vs Washington Capitals, April 8\n\nBrandon Carlo - Upper body\n\nDefensemen TOI:\n\nPlayoff Game 1 vs Ottawa Senators, April 12\n\nColin Miller - Lower body\n\nDefensemen TOI:\n\nPlayoff Game 2 vs Ottawa Senators, April 15\n\nAdam McQuaid - Upper Body\n\nDefensemen TOI:\n\nOver these past four games, the Bruins have been down to five defensemen for just under 80% of the time, with 179:29 out of a possible 257 minutes spend down a defenseman. The least amount of time in a game spent like this? The 45 minutes after Colin Miller's knee injury in game 1. He returned to the bench in the second period, but didn't take a shift past 15 minutes into the game. Which defensemen are eating up those minutes lost? Looking at the difference in their ice time the past four games compared to their regular season averages can give us a clue. Since Charlie McAvoy didn't play in any regular season games, we have nothing to compare him to, so whatever minutes he gives the Bruins is just found money.\n\nSome quick takeaways:\n\nCharlie McAvoy has gotten the trust of Cassidy, and fast. Although it's not like he's had any choice given his options on the right side\n\nKevan Miller has seen his ice time rise considerably, rising to Chara levels in the regular season\n\nChara has had a more measured increase in ice time, mainly because there's only so many more minutes he can play\n\nLooking back at the game two defensemen ice time, there was a clear top three that Cassidy leaned on, the two non injured top six defensemen from the regular season, and the fresh faced rookie, all over 27 minutes, with the fourth D man 7 minutes away, and the fifth defenseman at about half the ice time of the big three\n\nPretty obvious: They can't keep losing a defenseman every game, and they EVENTUALLY have to get one or two (Colin Miller and/or Brandon Carlo seem like the likely candidates, with Torey Krug the outside shot)\n\nI'll take the blame for McQuaid getting hurt. And I really hope I didn't jinx Kevan Miller as well, he's been solid."}

Consider swaddling the arms only.\n\nFollow SIDS and Kids guidelines – links below.\n\nStop swaddling once your baby is rolling, back to tummy and onto back again, during playtime, as it may prevent your baby from returning to their back during sleep (around 4-6months of age).\n\nDON'T\n\nWrap legs tight and straight down / pressed together. At this stage in life, the hip joint can be loosened in the straight-legged position.\n\nUse sleep sacks and pouches that tighten around the thigh.\n\nMethods\n\nDiamond – secure the arms individually. Twist the bottom of the wrap loosely so the legs are free to move within a sack, and tuck under your baby.\n\nSquare – secure the arms individually. Fold up the bottom of the wrap loosely over the chest, to create a pouch for free leg movement, then tuck under your baby.\n\nSleep sack or pouch – select those designed for free leg movement.\n\nSee the International Hip Dysplasia Institute video for demonstration;\n\nWhat Research Has Shown\n\nHip dysplasia is rare in cultures where infants are carried with their hips spread apart (abducted). There is a ten-fold increase in the incidence in tribes carrying infants on cradle boards with legs held straight and together.\n\nWhen the Navajo Indians replaced moss for diapers in the1940s, a big decrease in DDH was noted. Even though the cradle board was still in use, the slight spreading of the hips, by the diaper, was thought to influence this.\n\nIn 1975, a national program started in Japan to avoid swaddling with the legs straight, saw the incidence of hip dislocation drop from 3.5% to less than 0.2%.\n\nLinks\n\nRoyal Children's Hospital Video on Safe Wrapping\n\nVictorian Paediatric Orthopaedic Network Safe Wrapping Flyer - Royal Children's Hospital\n\nRed Nose (SIDS & Kids) Safe Sleep Recommendations\n\nSwaddling: IHDI Position Statement\n\nWritten: November 2015.

{"text": "Correction: In an earlier version of this story, the name of pilot Hooshang Shahbazi was incorrectly given as Hooshang Amiri.\n\nAn Iranian pilot whose spectacular emergency landing was captured on video will not be allowed to fly a plane for two months, the Fars news agency reported Saturday.\n\nThe video shows the Iran Air flight slowly approaching Tehran's Mehrabad Airport on Oct. 18 with its nose landing gear jammed. As rescue workers prepared for the worst, Capt. Hooshang Shahbazi balanced the plane using only the landing gear under the wings until it came to a stop.\n\nThe 40-year-old Boeing 727, which was returning from Moscow, had been blacklisted in Europe but not in Russia. A similar plane crashed in February in western Iran during bad weather, killing 77.\n\nShahbazi complained to news media here that Iranian authorities have not expressed any gratitude for his efforts, which saved the lives of 94 passengers and 19 crew members.\n\n\"They did not even call to say thank you,\" Shahbazi told the Etemaad newspaper, which is critical of the government, on Saturday. Instead he was told to stay home for two months to recuperate from the incident, the semi-official Fars news agency reported Saturday, adding that there will be an investigation into the cause.\n\nIran, which is not allowed to buy spare parts for its aging civil aviation fleet because of U.S. sanctions against the Islamic Republic, has a long history of plane crashes that have caused hundreds of deaths. In October, European fuel companies, under pressure from the United States, agreed to stop providing fuel to Iranian planes.\n\nBut even as Iran's state television remains silent on the effects of U.S. sanctions, Shahbazi's heroic actions have also gone unmentioned in Iran's state media. Authorities ignored the incident, which highlights Iran's growing need for new planes and the increasing pressure of ever tougher sanctions against the Islamic Republic.\n\nShahbazi cited a 2009 incident in the United States in which a U.S. Airways airliner was struck by a flock of birds. Captain Chesley Sullenberger managed to safely land the Airbus A320 on the Hudson River, steering away from Manhattan's high-rises, saving the lives of all 155 aboard and turning him into a national hero.\n\nShahbazi said that while he was not expecting such a reception, Iranian authorities \"should praise my colleagues in Iran Air. They only have to say 'thank you,' that's all.\"\n\nShahbazi had decided not to land his plane at Tehran's International Imam Khomeni Airport because a crash there would have closed its only runway. \"That would have been a disaster for Iran, also politically,\" he said.\n\nPassengers on board the Moscow-Tehran flight clapped and cheered as they exited the plane.\n\nThe plane, which suffered only minor damage, will be repaired and go back into service, an Iran Air spokesman said."}

Several cease-fire deals announced as part of the Minsk accords -- September 2014 and February 2015 pacts aimed to resolve the conflict -- have reduced fighting but not stopped it.\n\nAlexander Hug, the principal deputy chief monitor of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's Special Monitoring Mission (OSCE SMM) to Ukraine, said last week that 425 civilians have been killed or injured in the conflict since the beginning of this year, according to Ukrainian media. Thirty-nine of them were children.\n\nIn a tweet on November 12, Volker said the civilian casualty toll for 2017 is \"outpacing 2016\" and added: \"People of Donbas deserve a real ceasefire.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin in September proposed deploying UN peacekeepers on the contact line separating the sides of the conflict to protect monitors from the OSCE.\n\nThe plan swiftly drew criticism from both Kyiv and the West, in part because of concerns that deployment only along the front line would cement Russian control over separatist-held territory.\n\nVolker said Washington wants the mission to monitor the entire conflict area and make sure heavy weapons are pulled back.\n\nPutin later said he was open to adjustments to his initial proposal, but no agreement has been reached.\n\nUkrainian President Petro Poroshenko's office said on November 4 that he held a telephone conversation with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson during which they \"coordinated further steps for the deployment of an international UN mission\" in the separatist-held parts of Luhansk and Donetsk, including the border between those areas and Russia, which Kyiv says is used to ship weapons and military personnel in from Russia.\n\nVolker last met Surkov on October 7 in Belgrade.

{"text": "\"Ask TriMet\" answers some of the questions we get frequently from riders. Have a question? Send it to ask@trimet.org and we may feature it in a future post.\n\nRiders ask us variations of this question from time to time, usually after they see—or smell—someone smoking in or near a TriMet stop. The short answer is, \"Yes.\" Enforcement actions can take the form of a verbal or written warning, a $250 fine, or even an exclusion from the system.\n\nWhat is the ban?\n\nIf you're not familiar with the smoking ban, here's the rule according to TriMet Code 28.1 A(2): \"No person shall smoke an electronic cigarette, tobacco or any other substance, or shall carry any lighted or smoldering substance, in any form aboard a District Vehicle, in any elevator or underground area of a District Station, or within any space or area where posted signage prohibits smoking.\" The ban took effect in 2005.\n\nWhere are No Smoking signs posted?\n\nCurrently, all of our MAX and WES stations and about 80 percent of bus stops with shelters have No Smoking signs. By the end of the year, all bus stops with shelters will have them.\n\nAt stops without shelters, the smoking ban does not apply. These stops are technically considered public property, so we can't prohibit smoking there.\n\nSo where exactly are smokers allowed to smoke?\n\nOne of our lead supervisors, Jim Waddington, explains the boundary where the ban applies as \"inside the drip-line of a bus or MAX shelter, or anywhere on a TriMet-only MAX platform.\" TriMet-only MAX platforms are those that don't share space with public sidewalks (at Hollywood Transit Center, for example).\n\nSo that means that at all bus shelters and at MAX stations along public sidewalks, such as in Downtown Portland, smoking is allowed as long as it's outside the drip-line of the shelter. If someone is standing just one step outside of the shelter and smoking, they're not breaking the rule.\n\nHow we enforce the ban\n\nOf course, we can't patrol all of our stops and stations for smokers 24/7. But in a month on average, fare inspectors, supervisors, and local police will take actions against over 80 smokers. Enforcing the smoking ban often leads to opportunities to stop other prohibited behavior, such as riding without a valid fare. Police have even caught a few criminals with outstanding warrants by running a background check after first catching them smoking.\n\nBy the way, if you see someone smoking regularly at a stop or station at around the same time of day on the same days of the week, let us know. Our enforcement staff can then visit the stop and, if they catch the smoker breaking the rule, they can take the appropriate action.\n\nHave a question?

{"text": "California farmers now must abide by the nation's strictest rules for a widely used pesticide in a change designed to protect farmworkers and people who live and work near agricultural fields but is likely to raise prices on produce.\n\nThe restrictions announced Wednesday target chloropicrin, a pesticide injected into the ground before planting crops such as strawberries, tomatoes and almond orchards. In recent years, the chemical has caused hundreds of people to suffer from irritated eyes, coughing fits and headaches, state officials said.\n\nThe new regulations surpass standards required by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nBrian Leahy, director of the California Department of Pesticide Regulation, said Tuesday that the higher standard is needed in California, the nation's leading agricultural producer and most populated state, where farms are often next to people. Costs are sure to rise for farmers, who will pass it along to consumers, but Leahy said it is worth it.\n\n\"It is burdensome,\" Leahy said. \"But if we're going to use these tools, we've got to ensure that they're used as safely as possible.\"\n\nUnder the new regulation, farmers are limited to applying the pesticide on up to 40 acres in one day, a reduction of 75 percent. It also expands the distance between fields and human activity — in some cases to double the distance. Farmers who use upgraded tarps to cover their fields while applying the pesticide can follow less stringent regulations, said officials.\n\nFarmers use about 5 million pounds of the pesticide a year, most heavily in the Central Valley counties of San Joaquin and Fresno and along the coast in Monterey, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz and Ventura counties.\n\nThe state has been talking with growers for more than a year about the new standards and will immediately begin implementing them, with full compliance required by 2016.\n\nThe state documented 787 people as suffering from exposure to the pesticide drifting through the air between 2002 and 2011, according to the most recent records. In 2013, 19 people picking raspberries in Monterey County were sickened, and in 2012, 15 people in their homes and two firefighters near a Ventura County strawberry field reported irritated eyes, officials said.\n\nCalifornia farmers fear that tighter restrictions will increase the costs of their fruits and vegetables, potentially driving the market out of state or the country. Almond and grape growers use chloropicrin once every 20 to 30 years when they plant a new orchard or vineyard, but California's strawberry growers, who use it each season, may be hit hardest.\n\nCalifornia produces 88 percent of the nation's strawberry crop, supporting a $2.3 billion industry, said Carolyn O'Donnell, a spokeswoman for the California Strawberry Commission.\n\nIt will cost the state's strawberry growers an estimated $20 million to buy upgraded tarps to cover their crops and comply with the standards, she said.\n\n\"Farmers and their families live near their farms and work in their fields and care deeply about protecting the safety of their workers, neighbors and communities,\" O'Donnell said."}
{"text": "The backlash against Merkel bashing by the French Socialists\n\nThe fallout from the French Socialists' Merkel-bashing is all over in the press this morning though Hollande's new enterprise friendly growth proposal got some coverage as well. Calling Angela Merkel \"austerity chancellor\" and of \"selfish intransigence\" provoked strong protests from the conservative parties on both sides of the Rhine.\n\nFranco-German quarrels are not new, but it is bad timing. Until the German elections in September this year both countries have to work together on several controversial issues: A new perspective for fiscal consolidation and growth, the banking union and a free-trade agreement with the USA. EU diplomats worry about a rude tone and a breakdown in dialogue and the lack common initiatives between the two countries in a time when there is a need more than ever for both countries to work together constructively, according to Les Echos. The rules for bank recapitalisation through the ESM are to be agreed upon as well as the rhythm of fiscal adjustment over the medium term.\n\nThe Franco-German éclat over the last days had one good effect though, according to Cecile Cornudet in Les Echos. Germany mobilised the opposition and reunited the UMP party to an extend none of the other themes managed to. All are blaming Francois Hollande personally for the rise of germanophobia in the Socialist party. Francois Fillon and Jean-Francois Cope issued their first common statement since the battle over the party presidency last autumn to accuse Hollande using Angela Merkel as a scapegoat for his own failed economic policy. Alain Juppe, Bruno Le Maire and Bernard Accoyer all raised their voices leaving this time no space for Nicolas Sarkozy to issue his statement.\n\nLe Monde says playing with Germanophobia is an old game between the French left and right, citing some examples over the last 12 years. Then the roles were inverse, with the left reacting to the UMP accusing them of unbearable German-bashing.\n\nFrancois Hollande, meanwhile, wants to turn a page with his business friendly proposals, which nearly got side-tracked in the news. The proposals including breaks on capital-gains taxes as well as visas for foreign entrepreneurs. Hollande plans to introduce a tax exemption of up to 85% of capital gains for investors in startups, and other mechanisms aimed at encouraging investors to put their money into small businesses, writes Wall Street Journal. The new tax exemptions replace a complex web of around 40 existing rebates. It will add rebates for investors who keep their capital in a company: A rebate on capital-gains taxes will reach 65% for investors who hold their stake for eight years, instead of 40% at present. The total rebate could be as high as 85% for investors who bought shares when a company was less than 10 years old. As part of the new image changing initiative, Hollande also announced an educational programme in entrepreneurship to be introduced in schools for children from age 11 upward, involving business leaders and internships for youths."}

During last year's presidential campaign, Kasowitz threatened to sue the New York Times if it did not retract a story about women who accused Trump of touching them inappropriately. The Times did not retract the story.\n\nHe also assisted in the defence of fraud claims against Trump University, a series of real-estate seminars. After the election, Trump settled the claims for $25 million.\n\nTrump has looked to Kasowitz's firm to fill positions in his administration. He has described former Senator Joseph Lieberman, a senior counsel at the firm, as a top candidate to serve as FBI director and is considering Edward McNally, a white-collar defence lawyer at the firm, as the next US attorney in Manhattan. A former partner at the firm, David Friedman, was chosen by Trump as US ambassador to Israel.\n\nKasowitz also represents OJSC Sberbank of Russia, the country's largest bank, which is being accused in a US federal court of conspiring with granite company executives and others to raid the assets of a competitor.\n\nThe outside counsel would be separate from the White House Counsel's Office, led by Donald McGahn.\n\nMueller was appointed as special counsel by the Justice Department last week to investigate the Trump campaign's possible ties to Russia.

A Senate confirmation hearing is likely to be held within two weeks, congressional and administration officials said, although a date has not been set.\n\nClinton was released from a New York hospital Wednesday evening, three days after a blood clot was discovered inside her skull. Her doctors predict a full recovery from the clot and an apparently related concussion she suffered in a fall last month.\n\n\"She's sounding terrific, upbeat, raring to go,\" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Thursday. Nuland said Clinton plans to be in the office next week but did not give a specific date.\n\nClinton's return sets in motion a quick succession of congressional appearances that had been on hold pending news of her health, with a goal of handing off to Kerry shortly before or after Inauguration Day.\n\nClinton plans to keep her earlier pledge to testify to House and Senate committees about the fatal attack on a diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, Nuland said. No date has been set for those appearances, and they are not likely before the week of Jan. 14, two officials said.\n\nThe Libya hearings are a command performance to satisfy congressional Republicans critical of the Obama administration's handling of security in Libya before the attack and of its erroneous claim that the attack was linked to anti-U.S. protests elsewhere in the Mideast instead of to terrorists.\n\nClinton was too sick to present the findings of an independent inquiry into the attack during congressional hearings last month and pledged then to return in person in January.\n\n\"She is committed to testifying, and we are working with the committees on an appropriate set of dates,\" Nuland said.\n\nSenate Republicans announced committee assignments Thursday that will affect the makeup of the panel Clinton would address.

That includes slapping Pyongyang with the state-sponsored terrorism label. It is, in fact, a bad idea, because the evidence to justify it is thin at best. That makes the US look like its breaking—or at least, bending—the rules of the game to suit its own purposes.\n\nUsborne added that Trump's latest provocation, combined with new sanctions that were unveiled just after North Korea was added to the terrorist list, could result in Kim Jong-un ordering a new round of missile tests and launches, worsening the crisis.\n\nThe newest sanctions will affect shipping companies and are aimed at curbing China's trade relations with North Korea, and follow earlier sanctions on the country's seafood and coal exports, depriving Pyongyang of nearly a third of its revenue.\n\nFollowing the Trump administration's actions against North Korea this week, Rep.

Those who can afford rent live in rooms or houses, while the most impoverished occupy ad hoc settlements that have sprung up in and around northern towns such as Arsal.\n\nAccording to UNHCR, 78 percent of Syrian refugees in Lebanon are women and children.

In addition, many men have elected to continue fighting in Syria instead of fleeing to Lebanon and other neighboring countries. These circumstances ensure that the majority of Syrian refugees are also the most vulnerable. Reports of sexual harassment and assault of women and girls, sometimes by other Syrians, but mostly at the hands of local men, have dogged settlements in Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt for some time.\n\nJihane Larous, UNICEF's child protection and gender-based violence specialist, says the threat of sexual violence, combined with extreme poverty, has caused an upswing in the number of child marriages among Syrian refugees.\n\n\"With the emergency surrounding the conflict in Syria, the trend of early marriage has increased,\" says Larous. \"At the same time, the reasons for early marriage have changed. In addition to the economic motivation behind this practice...there is also the issue of protection...to protect the honor of the girl and her family. Because of the prevalence of sexual violence, whether in Syria or here in Lebanon, marrying your daughter puts her under the protection of a man, so she'll be less at risk of being assaulted.\"\n\nIn a much smaller, shabbier room at a settlement near a mosque in Arsal, another 12 women sit on mattresses lining the floor. Their clothes are torn and ragged, their faces tired. A few hold babies in their laps. The mother of three of the girls, a middle-aged woman named Rihab, holds court at the center of the room.\n\n\"The girls can't leave and go anywhere by themselves,\" she says. \"The men harass them and grope them. Honestly, I have two girls who aren't married yet. If men came along and wanted to marry them, I would agree right away, so I can save them...from the danger and harassment.\"\n\nA 20-year-old woman named Reem holds a squirming three-year-old girl in her lap as she talks.\n\n\"A girl we know was kidnapped by four men,\" she says. \"They kept her for 10 days, then threw her in the street. Imagine how traumatized she must be. 10 days, and God forbid, four men.\"\n\nOne of Rihab's daughters, a pretty 17-year-old named Sarab, chimes in. \"Now her father wants to marry her to anyone, even a beggar,\" she says, shaking her head."}
{"text": "More than just a fancy name. TURNIGY nano-tech Lipoly batteries were designed from the ground up with serious performance in mind. Utilising an advanced LiCo nano-technology substrate that allows electrons to pass more freely from anode to cathode with less internal impedance. In short; less voltage sag and a higher discharge rates than a similar density lithium polymer (non nano-tech) batteries.\n\n\nFor those that love graphs, it means higher voltage under load, straighter discharge curves and excellent performance. For pilots it spells stronger throttle punches and unreal straight-up performance. Excellent news for 3D pilots!\n\n\nUnfortunately with other big brands; numbers, ratings and graphs can be fudged. Rest assured, TURNIGY nano-techs are the real deal, delivering unparalleled performance!!\n\nLithium Polymer batteries are used in many RC hobby industries. Over the last few years, Lipo batteries have become the most popular battery choice for anyone looking for a longer run time and higher power.\n\nLipo batteries weigh less and can be made into almost any size or shape. Lipo batteries have higher capacities, hold more power and have a higher discharge rate, meaning they pack more punch. For safe use and storage of Lipo batteries, you need to follow the rules and treat the batteries with the respect they deserve.\n\n\nSpecs:\n\nCapacity: 5000mAh\n\nVoltage: 8S1P / 8S Cell / 29.6V\n\nDischarge: 65C Constant / 130C Burst\n\nWeight: 1066g (including wire, plug & case)\n\nDimensions: 153x49x71.7mm\n\nBalance Plug: JST-XH\n\nDischarge Plug: XT-90\n\n\nAdvantages over traditional Lipoly batteries;\n\n• Power density reaches 7.5 kw/kg.\n\n• Less Voltage sag during high rate discharge, giving more power under load.\n\n• Internal impedance can reach as low as 1.2mO compared to that of 3mO of a standard Lipoly.\n\n• Greater thermal control, pack usually doesn't exceed 60degC\n\n• Swelling during heavy load doesn't exceed 5%, compared to 15% of a normal Lipoly.\n\n• Higher capacity during heavy discharge. More than 90% at 100% C rate.\n\n• Fast charge capable, up to 15C on some batteries.\n\n• Longer Cycle Life, almost double that of standard lipoly technology.\n\n\nThe nano-core technology in lithium ion batteries is the application of nanometer conductive additives. The nanometer conductive additives form ultra-strong electron-conducting networks in the electrodes which can increase electronic conductivity.\n\n\nThese additives create the ability for imbibition in the carrier liquid to supply more ion channels. This improves the ability of ion transmission and ion diffusion. Through improving electronic conductivity and ion transmission, the impedance is reduced and the polarization of high rate discharge decreases greatly."}

Some frequently donate to progressive NGO's and think tanks, and many are returning to back Hillary after helping her into the Senate.\n\nBig money, big industry\n\nOf the top ten industries donating to Clinton's cause, the securities & investment industry has by far brought the biggest cash hoard to Clinton's war chest: $58,580,685. So when Trump points at Wall Street investors and manufacturers who own overseas labor as Clinton cronies, he is not far from the truth. Meanwhile, The Don is donating several million to his own campaign while attempting to play catch-up with Hillary's fundraising efforts.\n\nSource: OpenSecrets Silicon Valley bankrolling Hillary\n\nSilicon Valley accounts for 50 percent of California's GDP, and the Golden State owns the world's sixth largest economy. It's no wonder more money hasn't flowed toward Washington so that projects of \"disruption\" don't garner more lenient laws -- say, on immigration so that the best talent can be hired -- but for the most part, the technocrats have stayed on the sidelines until 2016. That's when Peter Thiel jumped in, Apple's Tim Cook hosted a fundraiser for Clinton, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given more than $100,000 to the Democratic nominee.\n\nHe joins other heavy hitters to donate six figures, including the CEO's of Salesforce and Solar City, Google's CFO, Zynga's chairman, and LinkedIn's founder who've all done the same. Early in September, Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz set a new benchmark, when he donated $20 million to Hillary's campaign. It is by far the single largest donation toward a political campaign to come from Tech.\n\nSuper PAC donations\n\nRight now donations of $200 or less make up just 19 percent of the campaign's contributions. Her primary opponent, Bernie Sanders, famously touted a $27 average donation as he decried the Citizens United ruling and promised to have it overturned. Nearly 30 percent of Hillary's $516.6 million war chest comes from super PAC's, much of that from the wealthy donors and companies who have given to Priorities Action USA.\n\nWATCH: Donald Trump accuses Clinton of pay-to-play, 'follow the money'"}

{"text": "Introduction\n\nThe demarcation between consumer and enterprise SSDs is becoming a blurry line in some cases. The cloud computing market is growing quickly, and SSDs afford performance advantages in both performance and power consumption metrics. It is predicted that the Internet, and the servers powering it, consume 1.5% of the global power output.\n\nThis may not seem like a large number, until we take into consideration that this is roughly the output of 30 nuclear power plants, or 30 billion Watts, and leads to a whopping power bill of $8.5 billion annually. SSDs bring tremendous advancements in the IOPS produced per Watt of energy consumed, and in many cases, this is one of the driving factors in the decision to deploy them into an enterprise environment.\n\nAs with any device that delivers a substantial performance advantage over a commodity product, SSDs command a much higher price than their HDD counterparts do. The performance advantages of SSDs, in addition to their enhanced density, lower power requirements, and other factors combine to make them a cheaper long-term solution than HDD storage. While the lowered TCO is a big magnet drawing prospective buyers into considering SSDs, the up-front expenditure is also the largest inhibitor to deploying SSDs into the datacenter.\n\nThis pricing double-edged sword leads many to look for value-oriented solutions. This eventually turns the eye to consumer SSDs and their lower price structure. For those unaware of the differences the learning curve can be steep and come at a high cost. Users are typically aware that client (consumer) SSDs feature a lower endurance threshold than enterprise products. When comparing the price and performance of consumer SSDs, many mistakenly think that they can overcome the high price premium of enterprise SSDs simply by replacing cheaper consumer SSD more often (rip-and-replace).\n\nUnfortunately, many users simply look at the specifications of client hardware and immediately think that these radically high specifications will equate to a high level of performance in heavy usage enterprise scenarios, when in fact this could not be further from the truth.\n\nIntoxicating performance specifications for client hardware lead many to make the jump without considering the significant impact that differing hardware specifications can have upon the real performance in an actual deployment. Client SSDs higher performance specifications are not indicative of long-term sustained performance in typical enterprise usage scenarios. We take a deeper look at the different test methodologies on the following page.\n\nThere are several key differentiators between client and enterprise SSDs, with performance, consistency, power efficiency, duty cycles, power loss protection, and data protection features chief amongst them. This is a daunting list, and by no means will we cover all of these facets in today's article.\n\nThe focus today is relatively simple: performance variability and latency. Deploying an SSD that does not deliver sustainable performance over the long term can end up significantly affecting TCO. Making significant tradeoffs in endurance to realize a cost saving is a risky gamble with data, but doing so at the expense of overall performance removes the initial motivation of utilizing an SSD to address performance challenges."}
{"text": "http://fate-srd.com/fate-accelerated/aspects-fate-points#establishing-facts In our game, these are often expressed with Power Facts : truths about the character's powers. Although these facts do not change the effectiveness of the uses of Approaches (your approach level and stunts impact that), the scope of what you can do is largely impacted by your Aspects, as defined by power facts. Let's look at Miss Martian , whose character sheet appears in the link.\nHer power facts state that as a Martian she has the following abilities: Shape-shifting: She can change her form, completely altering her physical appearance, including her organic clothing, allowing her to mimic other people as well as adapt to different environments. Malleability: She can extend her limbs into large whips to grab things at great distance. Healing: Her shape-shifting allows her to heal faster than a human would.  Camouflage: She can change the appearance of her form (and her clothes) to match her surroundings, but she is not completely invisible. Super strength: Like all Martians, Miss Martian has strength above that of a typical human. Telepathy: Telepathy comes naturally to Martians. She can create a telepathic link with her teammates, which makes communications easier and untraceable. Megan can also telepathically connect with her Bio-Ship. Multilingualism: Megan can speak Martian and English. She can also translate languages psychically.  Telekinesis: Megan can use telekinesis to manipulate many objects with her mind. However, she can lose control when moving too many objects at once or not paying enough attention. By telekinetically moving herself, she can simulate flight.  Heat/Fire Sensitive: Miss Martian can be weakened when exposed to direct heat or fire This is, to be fair, an overwhelmingly MASSIVE list of abilities, all granted by a single aspect. Surely this is broken character compared to someone like Robin who is limited to what his wits and agility alone allows him? Yes....and no. As noted above she is still limited in the use of all of these abilities by the strength of her approaches and stunts, just like any other character. This is the beauty of Fate in many ways: even with all of these vast powers she is ultimately using the same four actions available to anyone else, and is no stronger in general at them than anyone else. It's just the permissions of what these actions can mean narratively is expanded by her powers. When we get to making characters in our game, the following questions should be addressed: What can your powers do? How do they work and/or why can you do these things? What limits can be compelled on them? As long as the three questions above can be answered, you have created a great set of powers for the game. :-) *** Next up: Approaches vs Skills in Fate .

And yes it comes with an equally cute little driver board and USB-enabled 40-pin to 50-pin touchscreen adapter board.\n\nWe tried to get the smallest display that would be good for embedded computing usage and at a good price. We also chose our favorite 5\" touchscreen then paired it with a small USB powered driver board through our 50pin to 40pin + AR1100 Adapter. The screen itself is commonly seen in consumer electronics such as miniature TVs, GPSs, handheld games, car displays, etc. It comes with a 40-pin connector that has eight red, eight green, and eight blue parallel pins for 24-bit color capability.\n\nThe driver board only has an HDMI input but for Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone Black and other computers. HDMI is the best quality output available so you'll get a great looking display. The display is very easy to use - simply connect the USB power cable to 5V power supply that can provide 500mA, then connect a digital video source to one of the HDMI port. Voila, a display! To demonstrate it, we took some photos with the display connected to a Raspberry Pi, but it will also work connected to any device with HDMI output. We also noted it does not work with a Raspberry Pi + Windows 10 IOT yet.\n\nThe touchscreen controller shows up as a plain 'HID Mouse' device - and we do the touch screen calibration step here so you can plug and play. Works with any computer, just plug a mini B cable from the touch adapter to the computer USB port. If you want to calibrate it again, Microchip has Windows-only calibration software. For Linux users, check out xinput_calibrator which is the general-use X11 calibration software.\n\nThere's a little wired PCB with little buttons that let you enter a menu system for adjusting brightness, color and contrast. It tries to auto-detect which input you have and switches to that one or you can 'select' from the menu keypad which to display.\n\n\nFor use with a Raspberry Pi we suggest editing config.txt to set the HDMI to 800x480 in case it doesn't detect the resolution properly. You can see our suggested config.txt in the Technical details tab. The easiest way to edit the config.txt is to put the Pi SD card into an every day computer and edit config.txt with any text editor and save. For use with a Beagle Bone Black, we found it works when plugged in, no configuration required.\n\n\nWe show the TFT above on a wire stand, which is not included. You can pick up one of these nice stands over here.\n\n\nA power adapter is not included or required!

{"text": "President Barack Obama is calling anew on Congress to end tax subsidies for the oil and gas industry, saying the nation needs to develop alternative sources of energy in the face of rising gasoline prices.\n\nObama said Saturday in his weekly radio and Internet address that he expected Congress to consider in the next few weeks halting $4 billion in tax subsidies, something he hasn't been able to get through Congress throughout his presidency. He said the vote would put lawmakers on record on whether they \"stand up for oil companies\" or \"stand up for the American people.\"\n\n\"They can either place their bets on a fossil fuel from the last century or they can place their bets on America's future,\" Obama said.\n\nIndustry officials and many Republicans in Congress have argued that cutting the tax breaks would lead to higher fuel prices, raising costs on oil companies and affecting their investments in exploration and production. The measure is considered a long shot in Congress, given that Obama couldn't end the subsidies when Democrats controlled Congress earlier in his term.\n\nRepublican presidential candidates have accused Obama of delaying drilling for oil in the Gulf of Mexico and in a national wildlife refuge in Alaska and faulted him for not advancing the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to Texas Gulf Coast refineries. They have also criticized policies pursued by the Environmental Protection Agency as inhibiting energy development.\n\nObama said there is no quick fix to high gas prices, which climbed to $3.83 on Friday according to AAA, but he pushed back against critics who say he is opposed to more drilling. He said the U.S. is producing more oil than at any time in the past eight years and has quadrupled the number of operating oil rigs.\n\n\"If we're truly going to make sure we're not at the mercy of spikes in gas prices every year, the answer isn't just to drill more -- because we're already drilling more,\" Obama said. He said his administration was trying to develop wind and solar power, biofuels and usher in more fuel-efficient vehicles to make the nation less dependent on oil.\n\nIn the weekly Republican address, Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., said his constituents have been hard hit by an increase in gasoline prices and were \"fed up with the way the president is handling this issue, and rightfully so. The most forceful thing the president has done about high gas prices is try to explain that he's against them.\"\n\nGardner said the $800 billion stimulus spending sought by Obama promoted energy companies that went bankrupt, wasting taxpayer money.\n\n\"After spending money we don't have on what won't work -- and overregulating what would -- is it any wonder gas prices have more than doubled on the president's watch? Make no mistake, high gas prices are a symptom of his failed `stimulus' policies,\" Gardner said.\n\nObama is expected to keep up a drumbeat on energy this week, traveling to four states over two days to push his administration's \"all of the above\" energy strategy.

{"text": "Dave Wilton, Saturday, April 08, 2006\n\nWhere did this slang word for woman come from? It comes from a broad being a playing card. This may sound absurd on the face of it, but if you follow the development of slang uses of broad it all becomes clear.\n\nBroad is an 18th century slang term for a playing card, especially one used in three card monte. This usage may refer to style of playing deck. In modern card decks, a bridge deck has narrower cards than are found in a poker deck. If this variation in card size is older (I know words, not cards), then a broad could be a reference to this larger cut of cards. From George Parker's 1781 A View of Society:\n\nBlack-Legs, who live by the Broads and the Turf [...] Cant for cards.\n\nBy the 20th century this sense of broad had expanded to include tickets of admission and transportation. From Field's Watch Yourself of 1912:\n\nFix the olly! I gave him broads to the show!1\n\nAnd from Jackson & Hellyer's 1914 A Vocabulary of Criminal Slang:\n\n\"Beating the broads\" is corrupting the conductor or other collecting functionaire of a transportation line.2\n\nAt about the same time, the term is recorded to mean a prostitute. Also from Jackson & Hellyer:\n\nBroad, Noun Current amongst genteel grafters chiefly. A female confederate; a female companion, a woman of loose morals. Broad is derived from the far-fetched metaphor of \"meal ticket,\" signifying a female provider for a pimp, from the fanciful correspondence of a meal ticket to a railroad or other ticket.3\n\nIf the meal ticket connection is too much for you, the sense could have jumped from three card monte to woman. The goal of that game is to pick the queen from among three cards, and broad could have transferred from the card, to the queen, to women.\n\nThe general sense of broad meaning a woman, as opposed to the specific one of prostitute, is cited from 1911, from the September issue of Hampton's Magazine:\n\nPretty soon what is technically known as a \"broad\"—\"broad\" being the latest New Yorkese—hove into sight.\n\nAlthough this general sense is cited three years earlier than the prostitution sense, it is likely that the prostitution sense is older since the earliest citations of that are in slang dictionaries, meaning the term was around for a while before the lexicographers got hold of it.4\n\n1Historical Dictionary of American Slang, v. 1, A-G, edited by Jonathan Lighter (New York: Random House, 1994), 271.\n\n2Louis E. Jackson and C.R. Hellyer, A Vocabulary of Criminal Slang (Portland, OR: Modern Printing Co., 1914), 20.\n\n3Jackson and Hellyer, Criminal Slang, 19.\n\n4HDAS, v. 1, 271."}
{"text": "Some hold with the theory that the development of an embryo shows the stages of evolution. In other words, what first develops is fishlike, and then like a small mammal, and then like a lemur or ape, and then something we would recognize as human. Very early embryos have what look like little gill slits in the beginning of their development. At about four weeks, embryos have a little tail. At around six to twelve weeks, the white blood cells dissolve the tail, and the fetus develops into an average, tail-less baby... most of the time, at least. Every now and again, we get a little extra bit of baby, in the form of a vestigial tail.\n\nNot all things that look like tails - protrusions from the tailbone - actually are what doctors consider \"true\" tails. There are a number of growths or cysts that can form right on the tip of the tailbone. Some of the more unpleasant options are large tumors, elongation of the existing vertebrae, and even parasitic twin tissue. (A parasitic twin is not a fully-formed twin, but the product of another fertilized egg that somehow became fused with the embryo and never developed into a full human being.) True tails form when the white blood cells, for whatever reason, don't absorb all the tissue that formed during embryonic development. These babies carry the marks of humans earliest ancestors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause there are only between 20 and 30 cases of \"true\" vestigial tails since the late 1800s, there is some controversy about what such a tail contains. Some early accounts say that there are sometimes extra vertebrae in such tails. No modern tails have been found to have any bone tissue. They're mostly skin with fat, connective tissue, nerves, and muscle tissue. They can be just a stub, but some babies can be born with tails 13 centimeters long. The tails aren't strictly useless inert structures. Because they have muscle tissue inside, they can actually be twitched back and forth, or even contracted into curves. These days babies don't have their tails long enough to gain a lot of muscle control over them. Removing them is a simple operation, usually done not long after birth.\n\nWhat remains are questions of why these tails grow in the first place. They're rare enough that researchers aren't left with many clues. Researchers have, for the most part, ruled out family history - which throws the science of the X-Files episode I got the top image from right out the window. The tails are associated with spina bifida, a dangerous condition in which the canals of the spinal cord don't entire close before birth, but they are often present without the disorder. And for some reason they're twice in common in males as they are in females. In the end, no one knows why some babies just develop tails. (Besides, gills are much more practical.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImage: Popular Science Monthly\n\nVia Baby Med, NCBI, NCBI, PJSR, and Hindawi."}

Three other cars -- the Chevy Impala, Buick Regal and Cadillac XTS -- will cease production this year.\n\nGM has said that it won't make any decisions until it concludes union negotiations later this year.\n\nCanadian autoworkers' union Unifor hopes the Detroit-based company will take advantage of the falling loonie to modernize the Oshawa facility for the production of high-tech vehicles.\n\n\"We are sitting today at a Canadian dollar below 70 cents. They're printing money based on the operations. Why wouldn't they take advantage of that?\" Unifor national president Jerry Dias told CTV News.\n\nThe government says that a $500 million innovation fund is available if the car company is interested in keeping the plant alive.\n\n\"These decisions by companies are not made on the spot. What they're looking for is a government that's willing to work with them, to partner with them,\" Bains said.\n\nThe company has gradually moved production outside Canada to places such as Michigan, despite the federal and provincial government pouring billions into the company amid the 2008 economic crash. The investment was made, in part, to help keep auto jobs in Ontario.\n\nGM's indecision comes as Trudeau aims to rebrand Canada from a resource-rich nation to a country of resourceful and highly educated workers.\n\nNo firm deals have been inked, but officials say the prime minister is making important relationships for the future.\n\nGM wasn't the only automaker on the prime minister's agenda. Trudeau also met with the chairman of India's Tata Motors, which builds the world's cheapest car, the Tata Nano.\n\nThe company has considered moving production to North America.\n\nAnd while Canada hasn't locked down any deals, Trudeau seems to be in high demand. According to one report, about 400 people came for his keynote address Wednesday -- more than were in the room just minutes before as two top Iranian officials spoke.\n\nWith files CTV's Richard Madan in Davos and The Canadian Press"}

And KPB is building that protein,\" Howard said.\n\nIn Owensboro, tobacco plants are \"infected\" with the protein, he said, and then they reproduce it \"like a photocopier.\"\n\nThe desired proteins are extracted from the plants and purified into a serum.\n\nScientists have long known that tobacco readily picks up genes inserted into it. The Owensboro facility uses that ability to quickly and inexpensively produce large volumes of a compound within weeks.\n\nKBP also has been selected for work on some of the biggest health threats on the planet, including H1N1 vaccine production, an anti-rabies antibody, norovirus or the \"cruise ship virus,\" HIV prevention, parvovirus, and HPV vaccine.\n\nZMapp, the drug used on the American Ebola victims, has not been approved in the United States or other countries, Howard said, but the Owensboro facility had begun ramping up production for anticipated drug approval testing protocols this year.\n\nThat process might be accelerated now.\n\n\"KBP is working closely with Mapp and other agencies to increase production, but that process will take several months,\" Howard said."}

{"text": "Updated December 11, 2014, 4:00 p.m.\n\nCongress found itself on the brink of an unexpected government shutdown on Thursday as House Republican leaders were forced to postpone a vote on a $1.013 trillion spending package hours before their deadline.\n\nThe 1,600-page proposal, unveiled less than two days ago, would fund nearly the entire federal government through September, but Democrats revolted over an extraneous provision rolling back regulations on Wall Street. By mid-afternoon, Speaker John Boehner and his lieutenants were in a rare and awkward alliance with the White House in seeking to overcome opposition both from conservatives and liberals. President Obama and other administration officials scrambled to shore up support in their party and were phoning lawmakers late into the afternoon.\n\nIn perhaps the most surprising development, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi campaigned in harsh tones against the Obama administration, accusing a Democratic president she has loyally backed for six years of backing a measure that \"blackmailed\" her members. \"This is a ransom. This is a blackmail,\" she declared in a fiery floor speech. She warned that the provision weakening regulations on derivatives trading, enacted in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, could lead to the same financial calamity that befell the nation when the economy collapsed in 2008. \"We're being asked to vote for a moral hazard,\" she said. \"Why is this in an appropriations bill? Because it is the price of an appropriations bill.\"\n\nBut Democratic opponents are taking a big risk, as Boehner has warned them that if this bill fails, he'll bring up a stopgap measure that would push the fight into the new Congress that begins in January, when Republicans will have majorities in both the House and the Senate. Pelosi has used the fight over the spending bill to try to prove her relevance heading into the next Congress, when she will be leading a Democratic caucus smaller than at any time in decades. When GOP leaders delayed the vote, the former speaker sent off a missive to her members urging them to stand firm and insisting that Republicans \"don't have enough votes to pass\" the bill that Beltway insiders have derisively dubbed \"the CRomnibus.\" \"This increases our leverage to get two offensive provisions of the bill removed: the bank bailout and big money for campaigns provision,\" Pelosi wrote.\n\nIntroduced in the House on Tuesday, the measure funds all but one department in the federal government through next September. It boosts spending for the fight against Ebola and the war against the Islamic State while cutting funds for the IRS and the EPA. Earlier Thursday, Boehner voiced confidence the measure would clear the House. \"I expect this bill will receive bipartisan support and pass,\" he told reporters. But the measure's prospects worsened during a procedural vote shortly before noon to bring the bill up for debate. With Democrats united in opposition, Boehner and his deputies had to persuade a handful of recalcitrant Republicans to support the motion in a vote that was briefly deadlocked and held open for twice its allotted time. The motion passed by a single vote, 214-212, to set up the final vote."}
{"text": "The above meme has been shared more than 200,000 times across Facebook.\n\nThe extreme left-wing site Occupy Democrats, which posted the meme, says:\n\nBernie Sanders is calling for free tuition for deserving students at four-year public universities in America, where the average total cost including room and board has skyrocketed to $75,772. This is tremendously unfair to our youth.\n\nEmphasis added.\n\nThe site then links to a year-old article from\n\nThe Washington Postto support the claim that college isfree for deserving students\n\nin at least 8 countries around the world, including Chile, Brazil, Germany, Finland, France, Norway, Slovenia, and Sweden.\n\nThe problem is that the claim is false, or least highly deceptive, based on the criteria other countries have for determining who exactly is \"deserving\" of a \"free\" college education.\n\nBusiness Insider explains:\n\nWhile Democratic national contenders are calling for debt-free college in the US, they offer few details about how they would finance such a plan. Of course, many European countries like Germany already offer free college, though \"free\" is a relative term since tax payers absorb that cost. But those European countries often differ greatly from the US in substantive ways. Their college enrollment percentages, for example, are much lower than in America. Europe also traditionally has higher taxes than the US, which allows those countries to offer additional social services. … European countries also differ substantively from the US in terms of the percentage of college attendees that their debt free models serve. \"Germany has a lower percentage of students go on to college than we have here in the US,\" Mark Huelsman, a senior policy analyst at think tank Demos, told ATTN. … For all countries, with the exception of Finland, the US has a much higher percentage of students who have enrolled in post-high school education. This will likely add a level of complexity to debt-free college plans in the US.\n\nThe bottom line is that, outside the United States, university education is \"free\" only for those who get selected, the so-called \"deserving\" ones.\n\nBut the criteria that separates the deserving from the undeserving is rationed by the state budget and other critical factors–to help bolster special state-selected industries, for example.\n\nThe result is that college is \"free\" for only about 12-15%, and those numbers are usually reserved for the offspring of the political elites and the professional classes.\n\nThe majority of America's college-educated adults today could never have qualified to attend in the first place under such stringent rules.\n\nFreedom, opportunity, and economic sustainability will suffer if university education suddenly becomes \"free\" in the United States on the European model.\n\nFacebook has greatly reduced the distribution of our stories in our readers' newsfeeds and is instead promoting mainstream media sources.

I\n\nWaiting for Odysseus by Clemence McLaren was a surprisingly entrancing read. Within the first few pages I was hooked. I never thought any book about Greek Mythology could be so endearing. It starts off telling the story about a girl Penelope who loved this boy Odysseus. To her his was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen. Like most amazing love story their love was somewhat forbidden. So that's why when they were finally able to be together I felt like everything was right in the world. I was obsessed with their story and what would happen next. I loved Odysseus, I loved Penelope, and I loved them together. So that's why when Odysseus was sent to a war he wasn't intended to return from my heart broke. The rest of this book goes on to tell the journey Odysseus has to take in hopes of once again returning to his home Ithaca and to his dear sweet Penelope.\n\nAs I stated before I loved Penelope more than anything and I was absolutely obsessed with her story. So I wasn't too fond of having to switch gears and read about a girl I didn't know or care about. Even more so I was upset at Odysseus for taking on this women Circe as his lover. Although whether or not he is a cheater is not clear to me. After Circe story is told the book goes on to tell Athena's story and her role in this whole adventure. I absolutely love Athena, seeing as she does whatever she can to make sure Odysseus can make it home. This includes mentoring his son Telemachus who was just a young boy when his father left for his almost never ending journey home. The book ends telling the story of Eurycleia , a servant who basically raised him and his son.\n\nOverall I think this is a great book and a better pick for anyone wanting to learn about Odysseus' journey home after the Trojan War. I feel like this could be a good pick for girls because there is always the underlying tone of romance. It shows how much Odysseus loves Penelope each time he puts up a fight to make his way home. This would also be a good read for boys because there is a lot of action going on in Odysseus' adventures. There is also not too much romance to where it would be a turn off. This book will keep you intrigued and leave you rooting for Odysseus as read about his long journey home."}

{"text": "Zion-area agencies want federal money for old nuclear storage\n\nhello\n\nZion-area taxing bodies want compensation for what they say is the detrimental effect of acting as a storage site for 2.2 million pounds of spent fuel rods from the decommissioned nuclear plant along Lake Michigan.\n\nWhile an ideal solution would be to remove the waste, nearly three dozen entities representing communities, townships, Lake County, city, school, park and library districts, and businesses, regard that as a slim possibility.\n\nInstead, they are asking federal authorities to release funds that could help offset what they describe as the negative social and economic impact of hosting an \"interim nuclear storage site\" on 400 prime lakefront acres.\n\nJust outside the secure site, Zion Mayor Al Hill was joined by representatives of the various taxing bodies for a Monday news conference to introduce the push. He said individual attempts have been unsuccessful and he hoped a united front -- \"which represents thousands and thousands of voters\" -- is the best course.\n\n\"With the 2010 scuttling of the Yucca Mountain program, we are not naive enough to believe that the rods will be removed,\" Hill said. \"We therefore believe we should be compensated.\"\n\nThe intent is to have federal legislation proposed and adopted by October, he said.\n\nAccording to the parties, a 1982 federal law required power customers to pay for a fund to compensate communities hosting an \"interim nuclear storage site.\" Under the formula, Zion would be entitled to $15 million annually but has not received any funds.\n\nThe letter asks legislators to \"aggressively pursue\" the original intent of the federal law and propose legislation that would allow Zion to access the funds.\n\nThe Zion nuclear plant was built by ComEd between 1968 and 1973, was licensed in 1973, and operated between 1974 and 1998. At the time, the \"exciting new adventure\" was thought to be good for Zion, Lake County and the country, Hill said.\n\nHowever, the community knew there would be costs associated with locating the power plant along the lake, including \"an eyesore that could never be hidden\" and the severe inhibition of lakefront recreational access and development opportunities, he said. The trade-off for jobs and increases in local taxes from the plant came with the understanding the 400 acres would be returned in usable form when the operating license expired, he said.\n\nA letter is being sent to top federal and state officials and candidates for the offices. It is signed by 34 representatives of the local governments, including Lake County Board Chairman Aaron Lawlor and mayors of Beach Park, Waukegan and Wadsworth, as well as business interests and others.\n\nAccording to the letter, Zion has been in a downward spiral with a 46 percent drop in property values, an escalating tax rate and foreclosures without the ability to redevelop the site.\n\n\"If you've got spent fuel rods, are you going to spend $300,000 or $400,000 for a condo?\" Hill asked after the session.\n\n@dhmickzawislak"}
{"text": "AMD Eyedrop Hope Vasotide, a small molecule that stops VEGF binding to endothelial receptor molecules, has shown promise in animal models and can be delivered using eyedrops\n\nWouldn't it be nice if patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) could receive their anti-VEGF agents topically, rather than by intravitreal injection? A cyclic retro-inverted peptidomimetic, D(Cys-Leu-Pro-Arg-Cys) – also known as Vasotide – is the latest candidate for that role.\n\nVasotide works by selectively binding to the VEGF receptors VEGFR-1 and neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), and pilot studies performed in young mice with a retinopathy of prematurity-like phenotype showed that topical administration of the drug inhibited retinal angiogenesis (1). What's now been published are the results of preclinical evaluations in three animal models: a mouse oxygen-induced retinopathy, vldr-null mice (a mouse model of retinal angiomatous proliferation), and laser-induced choroidal neovascularization in Old World monkeys (2). In the latter experiment, topically-formulated Vasotide was administered twice daily from day 1 through day 5 after laser photocoagulation, then once daily on days 6 through 21. On retinal assessment at day 29, Vasotide use was associated with a significant (p<0.0001) reduction in the development of grade III and IV lesions compared with monkeys treated with vehicle alone – an outcome comparable to those achieved by ranibizumab or bevacizumab in this model.\n\nIn addition to the obvious benefits of a topical route of administration, the researchers hope that the fact that Vasotide targets NRP-1 in addition to VEGF-A, the drug might offer an alternative to patients who respond poorly to current treatments. In terms of the future potential of the drug, first author, Richard Sidman said, \"In addition to future clinical trials on AMD and ROP, we think that diabetic retinopathy and certain forms of cancer may also prove to be responsive to Vasotide.\"\n\nWelcome back,\n\nYou are already logged in Enjoy our FREE content!

{"text": "Don Miguel Ricardo de Alava, by William Salter.\n\nThe Diplomat. Madrid\n\nToday is the 200th anniversary of the battle of Waterloo, which put an end to the French Revolution and to Napoleon Bonaparte's imperial dreams. The Spanish diplomatic and military history has forgotten about one of its heroes of the Peninsular War, who played a determinant role in that battle.\n\nIt is the General Miguel Ricardo de Álava (Vitoria, 1772–Barèges, France, 1843), who held, on several occasions, the position of Spanish Ambassador to England (twice), France (twice) and the Netherlands.\n\nÁlava has the honour of being the only Spanish officer to have participated in the battles of Trafalgar and Waterloo, the most important ones of his time. He fought the first one –and lost– against the English of Admiral Nelson. He fought the second one in Belgian land against the French and along his friend Sir Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington.\n\nÁlava was ambassador of Ferdinand VII to the Netherlands, with headquarters in Brussels, when Napoleon fled from the island of Elba and returned to the metropolis victorious. By order of the monarch, he integrated into the General Staff of Wellington in which, at the end of the day, would be the only Spanish contribution to the so-called Seventh Coalition created against the French Emperor.\n\nThere is a lot of documentation, most of it British, indicating Álava's presence with Wellington the night prior to the battle (from 17 to 18 June 1815), as well as during it and, when everything was over, having dinner on their own at the inn Jean de Nivelles of Waterloo, according to the book 'Álava en Waterloo' by Ildefonso Arenas.\n\nGeneral Álava was Spanish Ambassador to England, France and the Netherlands\n\nSubsequently, this general was ambassador to France (1815 and 1835), deputy for Álava (1821), president of the Parliament (1822), ambassador to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (1834 and 1838), senator (1834 and 1836), minister of the Navy (1835) and president of the Cabinet for a few days (1835).\n\nDuring the Maria Christina's regency, he was ambassador to London, where he tried to manage the intervention of the Quadruple Alliance firmly and with economic and military support during the Carlist Wars in favour of the Queen Isabella II. However, his determination did not bear fruit.\n\nFinally, and not being very happy about it, he accepted to be ambassador to Paris, where he presented a plan for the Christian troops to cross to France in their fight against Carlism, to refuel in the neighbouring country and to stop the supplies getting to Carlists. In London's Embassy again, he returned to Spain, being already very sick, in June 1843 and died within a month on one of his trips to the south of France to take therapeutic baths."}

A second-round draft pick out of Texas Christian by the Cardinals in 2010, he signed a new, six-year contract with the team in the summer of 2012.\n\nIncluded in that deal was a $10 million bonus option to be earned earlier this month. The Cardinals, knowing of Washington's legal issues, picked up the option and are paying it in two installments, this year and next.\n\nA Cardinals spokesman said team officials would have no comment because it is an ongoing legal matter.\n\nPhoenix police said they began investigating Washington on May 1 after the mother of Washington's child called police saying Washington assaulted her at her apartment in Ahwatukee Foothills.\n\nThe woman told police that Washington pushed her with two hands, causing her to fall and break her collarbone, according to court documents.\n\nThe argument started during a routine visit by Washington to the apartment complex near Warner Road and 48th Street, where the woman lives with Washington's daughter, the documents said.\n\nWashington is scheduled to be sentenced in late April, according to a court spokesman.\n\nWashington has started 53 games in four seasons and led the team in tackles with 140 in 2012. Washington had nine sacks that season, more than any other inside linebacker in the NFL, and one short of the franchise record for a linebacker.\n\nIf Washington is suspended for a portion of a second consecutive season, the Cardinals could face a real challenge.

{"text": "Trump: 'Sad' N.Y. Bombing Suspect Gets Quality Medical Care, Lawyer\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump said at a campaign rally Monday that it's \"sad\" that the suspect in the weekend bombings in New York and New Jersey will receive medical attention and legal representation.\n\nThe GOP presidential nominee told a crowd near Fort Myers, Fla., that it was due to the work of law enforcement that the \"evil thug who planted the bombs\" was caught. Ahmad Khan Rahami was arrested Monday after being injured in a gun battle with police in Linden, N.J. He is suspected to have planted pressure-cooker bombs over the weekend that injured 29 people in New York's Chelsea neighborhood.\n\n\"But the bad part,\" Trump continued, \"now we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world. He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he'll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is.\"\n\nHe added, \"And on top of all that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer. His case will go through the various court systems for years and, in the end, people will forget and his punishment will not be what it once would have been. What a sad situation. We must have speedy, but fair trails and we must deliver a just and very harsh punishment to these people.\"\n\nFox 4 Now via YouTube\n\nIt's not clear what, presumably harsher, punishment Trump was referring to with his nostalgic lament for something that \"once would have been.\" Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was sentenced to death last year after he was convicted of the Boston Marathon bombing that killed three and left 240 with serious injuries, including 17 who lost legs.\n\nThe Constitution guarantees due process under the law and legal representation if the suspect cannot afford it. Rahami, 28, is a U.S. citizen who was born in Afghanistan. No foreign terror groups have claimed responsibility at this point.\n\nTrump also said that \"whatever lawful methods are available to obtain information\" should be used on Rahami \"to get information before it's no longer timely,\" and he called on Congress to \"pass measures to ensure that foreign enemy combatants are treated as such.\"\n\nBut such a measure would not apply to Rahami, since he is a U.S. citizen.\n\nThe Republican presidential nominee used the weekend attacks to paint his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton as weak on national security. Earlier on Monday, during an appearance on Fox News' Fox and Friends, he urged police to use racial profiling more often.\n\nAt the later Florida rally, Trump claimed that the terrorist groups \"want her so badly\" to become president. Clinton has made a similar charge of her rival, saying that ISIS wants him to win.\n\nIn response to the weekend's attacks, the former secretary of state said it was \"crucial that we continue to build up trust between law enforcement and Muslim-American communities.\""}
{"text": "As a kid, I played a game called The Sims, a life simulation game in which you create virtual people called Sims and help them satisfy their desires. Each Sim had its own set of meters for energy, appetite, hygiene and several more needs. A meter I found particularly interesting was comfort.\n\nNot unlike humans, Sims got moody when they stood up for a while or faced prolonged discomfort. For maximum happiness, they needed luxurious chairs, a comfortable bed and an expensive bathtub.\n\nWe tend to apply a similar logic to our own pursuit of happiness. As we grow, we invest lots of time and money creating a comfortable living space, assuming that, like Sims, added comfort will provide us higher well-being. But how wise of an investment is this?\n\nComfort as a drug\n\nHave you ever noticed how quickly you get used to new \"toys\"? Whether it's a next-gen phone or a cozy couch, things lose their freshness rapidly. The satisfying buzz they provide doesn't last, because our brain gets accustomed and ends up taking them for granted.\n\nIt is common knowledge that relying on drugs for happiness is an ineffective strategy; the body eventually demands more stimuli to feel \"okay\" and brings one into a downward spiral of endless fixes. But this pattern of needing more and more to feel all right isn't unique to drugs.\n\nAlthough comforts—like drugs—provide temporary relief and pleasure, we tend to get accustomed to them. We then require more luxuries to keep the same sense of satisfaction and begin chasing new toys. You might know from experience how easy inflating your lifestyle is, but rarely do we see people willingly lowering their consumption level.\n\nPeople living a luxurious lifestyle may seem to have it great. But they're hardwired like you. They too are used to their own degree of comfort. Regardless of how extravagant their consumption may seem, they aren't feeling much different; they envy those having more and wouldn't be comfortable living with less. They need more to feel like you.\n\nThere are many things we get used to and then believe we need. By increasing our needs in this fashion, we become increasingly dependent on our environment to feel satisfied. We raise the bar for what we find acceptable, thus making happiness a bit harder. Like spoiled children, each new convenience transforms us into a slightly pickier and somewhat more intolerant version of ourselves. Our roots gets stiffer and we lose flexibility.\n\nGetting accustomed to some level of material comfort is like needing a constant drug fix to feel okay. This is a dangerous gamble, because external circumstances can change unpredictably. What if comfort didn't require as much stuff?\n\nFreedom from comfort\n\nFundamentally, comfort is simply a healthy, non-reactive relationship to physical sensations. It isn't found in objects: a mattress isn't comfortable unless you are comfortable in it. I believe we have more to gain from developing a mind that's at ease in changing circumstances than from filling our environment with artificial comforts.\n\nHow free would you be if you were comfortable with discomfort?"}
{"text": "Google is launching a new product for enterprise marketers today that will directly challenge Adobe's Marketing Cloud and similar services.\n\nThe Google Analytics 360 Suite will combine Google Analytics Premium (now called Google Analytics 360) and Adometry (which it acquired in 2014 and which is now called Attribution 360), with an enterprise-class version of Google's Tag Manger and three new products (Audience Center 360, Data Studio 360 and Optimize 360) into a single solution for marketers.\n\nThe idea here, Google senior director of product management Babak Pahlavan tells me, is to provide marketers with a new solution that helps them work more efficiently in a multi-screen world. Marketers today — and especially in large organizations — often still base their marketing effort on what they learned during the desktop era. \"But this is about understanding the customer journey all the way to conversion,\" Pahlavan explained.\n\nThe service, which consists of these six different applications that are all tightly integrated with each other, is meant to help marketers engage with the right users at the right time and help advertisers understand their customers' journeys better.\n\nThe guiding philosophy behind all the new tools was to ensure that they were easy to use, even as they pull in vast amounts of data, and provide marketers with actionable information and not just a barrage of data.\n\n\"If you have very complex tools, they don't get used,\" Pahlavan noted. \"We focus on simplicity. How can we make tools that are extremely easy to use and that make it easy to collaborate?\"\n\nSo what's in this suite? One of the cornerstones of the product is clearly Google Analytics 360 — the rebranded version of Google Analytics Premium. It's where all the measurement data Google collects comes together, after all.\n\nOn top of that, though, Google is also launching Audience Center 360, a data management platform that will be integrated with Google's own tools (including DoubleClick) but that can also pull in data from third-party providers.\n\nWith Optimize 360, another completely new product, Google will now make it easier for marketers to run A/B tests on their sites to, for example, find the best version of a text snippet or image.\n\nThe most interesting of the completely new products, though, is probably Google Data Studio 360. This is where all the data visualization and analysis happens. Pahlavan tells me Data Studio was built on top of Google Doc's collaboration and sharing technology, but it is also powered by BigQuery — Google's data analytics platform.\n\nTag Manager, Analytics and Attribution are all rebranded versions of existing tools that will now get additional features (and in the case of Adometry, Google says Attribution has been \"rebuilt from the ground up\"). Most of these changes are scheduled to roll out over the next couple of months.\n\nThe four new products in the suite (Audience Center, Data Studio, Optimize and Tag Manager) are now in limited beta. Current Google Analytics Premium and Adometry users will should see an invite to join the new betas in the coming months."}

I'm sure in all our lives, there are moments that freeze in your memory . . . and I think for me, last night was one of those moments.\"\n\nAlto, along with Coun. Charlayne Thornton-Joe and Mayor Lisa Helps, brought forward the resolution as a result of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's Calls to Action, released last summer that revealed the wrongdoings of Canadians against First Nations in residential schools.\n\nThe Checkers Pavilion, a cross-shaped lookout building, currently occupies the hilltop, but it has not been used since the 1970s and was labelled unsafe to enter in 1995.\n\nAs part of the repatriation, the pavilion will be torn down, allowing local First Nations to build a roughly 2,000-square-foot long house, which will be used for traditional carving, cultural activities and provide a space to train the next generation of carvers in traditional arts.\n\nFor thousands of years, the pavilion has been a well-known sacred site for local First Nations, as well as First Nations from as far north as Alaska and as far south as northern California. It was seen as a social and economic gathering place where they exchanged information, goods, stories and history.\n\nHowever, they lost the land in 1842 and Beacon Hill Park was turned over to the city in 1882.\n\n\"This is very personal for the Songhees and Esquimalt First Nations. This was a very important area for them and having the city say, 'as part of our journey towards reconciliation, we want to repatriate this space and work with you',\" Alto said, adding the city is one of the first on the Island to turn the calls to action into something tangible.\n\nDuring the meeting, a number of members of the community stayed well into the early hours of the morning to express their support for the resolution. One woman even brought a petition that had more than 150 signatures asking the city to move ahead with the project.\n\nThe city and local First Nations will work together to decide what type of building will occupy the site and seek funding from the federal government.\n\nAlto said the longhouse should be constructed in time for Canada's 150th birthday celebrations in 2017.\n\nCalls to the Esquimalt and Songhees First Nations were not returned by press time."}

Saylor, 47, was sentenced to eight years in state prison.\n\nBefore trial, Saylor rejected a plea offer carrying a five-year sentence.\n\nHe was accused of falsely claiming that two outside agencies recommended against charging Bush after sexual abuse allegations against the Windermere man first surfaced in 2003.\n\nIn reality, prosecutor Ryan Williams said in the state's closing argument, Saylor \"took the stand and told a statement that was not true — a lie — to undercut [Bush's victims'] credibility,\" Williams said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Saylor took the stand again, in his own defense.\n\nHe claimed his officers told him the State Attorney's Office and Orange County Sheriff's Office had reviewed the case in 2003 and recommended against charging Bush: \"That's what I was told.\"\n\nHowever, on cross examination, he acknowledged telling Bush's jury that the case had been investigated \"thoroughly\" in 2003. Witnesses who testified this week said otherwise.\n\nSgt. Fred Westerberg, who ran the OCSO sex-crimes unit at the time, testified that one of his detectives sat in on an interview of Bush's victims in 2003, but only as a courtesy.\n\n\"There was no recommendation, because there was no investigation,\" Williams told jurors in the state's closing.\n\nDefense attorney William McClellan argued that Saylor was no different than any police agency head: \"They get their information from ... what their people are telling them,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Williams noted that Saylor didn't tell Bush's jury that the information he had was secondhand, or solely an opinion.\n\n\"When he took the stand on the behalf of Scott Bush, there was no uncertainty whatsoever,\" Williams said.\n\nSaylor was arrested in 2011 after a Florida Department of Law Enforcement probe. He later pleaded to official misconduct and other charges.\n\nBush was convicted of rape and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nSaylor's six-member jury deliberated just more than an hour Wednesday before returning their verdict.

Robert Bentley issued a statement Friday night saying the water issues impacting some parts of northern Alabama were \"not a crisis,\" despite one utility advising its customers not to drink their tap water.\n\n\"Based on my current understanding, I am confident that there is no health-related crisis based on the water quality of the West Morgan East Lawrence Water Authority,\" Bentley said in a news release. \"I believe every citizen should have safe water to drink.\"\n\nThe issue arose on May 19, when the Environmental Protection Agency issued a health advisory for man-made chemicals PFOS and PFOA, stating that lower concentrations of those compounds than previously thought could lead to health problems over time.\n\nAs a result, the West Morgan East Lawrence Water Authority advised its customers not to drink the water from its taps, which had been tested at concentrations above the new advisory threshold.\n\nBentley said that decision was made without talking to his office or other relevant state authorities.\n\n\"After consultation with the State Health Officer, Dr. Tom Miller, and the Director of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management, Lance LeFleur, it is apparent that a local decision was made which effectively turned an advisory into a regulation,\" Bentley said. \"My office, along with ADPH and ADEM were not aware that this decision was being contemplated prior to it being announced.\"\n\nMiller said the ADPH's health advisory is still in place, which recommends that expectant mothers, women who are breast-feeding or infants who use formula mixed with water consider avoiding tap water. That advisory did not recommend that the general population avoid tap water.\n\n\"The EPA's health advisory was based on concern for possible health effects due to exposures to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooactanoic acid (PFOA) over a certain level during a person's lifetime and not on acute or time-limited exposures,\" Miller said. \"EPA based its decisions on laboratory studies in rats and mice as well as a review of information from groups of people known to have been exposed to PFOS and PFOA in certain areas of the country.\"\n\nDon Sims, the general manager of the West Morgan East Lawrence Water Authority, said that he did not want to tell some people that the water was safe and others that it was not.\n\n\"I would rather be over-cautious than under-cautious,\" Sims said. \"I'm not a doctor, I'm not a chemist, but when they tell one class of people the water is not safe, I don't want to be the one to say 'you drink it and you don't.'\n\n\"So I said nobody drink it.\"\n\nLeFleur said that ADEM would continue to work with the water authority to ensure safe drinking water.\n\n\"Through a strong partnership with the Alabama Department of Public Health and federal agencies, we will continue to monitor any potential hazards related to perfluorinated chemicals in drinking water in the West Morgan East Lawrence Water Authority and other water systems throughout Alabama,\" LeFleur said."}

Over here, I'll be talking about some cool stuff PG does that SQL doesn't do. At least not 'natively'. There are workarounds, but we're still getting some circles run around us.\n\nSo here goes!\n\nUnlogged Tables! Forget wrestling with minimal logging, which sometimes just doesn't work, no matter which Trace Flags and hints you throw at it. You can just tell the engine you don't care about this table and it won't log any transactions for it. Yeah, put that in your ETL and smoke it.\n\nGenerate_series! This is one of those things that I used, and then spent hours playing with. You know all that crazy stuff we do with Tally Tables and Date tables? Yeah, PG users just use generate_series, and it spits out the range of values they want. It works with numbers and dates, and even handles intervals. It's pretty wonderful. Sick burn.\n\nArrays! Between array_agg and UNNEST, PG offers simple ways to handle a couple things that SQL Server users spend a lot of time trying to hack together T-SQL and CLR methods to deal with. If you've ever been mortified and confused by those SELECT STUFF FOR XML PATH shenanigans we use to create lists/arrays, or read one of the bounty of articles and arguments about splitting strings in SQL Server, you'd probably buy features like this a steak dinner.\n\nBRIN Indexes! As a guy who has dealt with a lot of large tables, and large indexes, something like this is really awesome. A Block Range Index basically stores high and low keys for each, you guessed it, Block Range within the index, and decides which blocks it needs based on those values. The upside is that indexes of this type are TINY compared to traditional indexes. It's a lot more like scanning the statistics histogram to figure out which steps you need, and then retrieving those steps.\n\nMultiple language stored procedures! Yep. Write a stored procedure in a language you're comfortable with. Tell PG what the language is at the end of the stored proc, and it will use it. If you've ever used CLR, and struggled with .dlls and trustworthy and blah blah blah, this probably sounds like a dream.\n\nMINDOP! Just kidding. But I do wish we had this. It'd be way more useful than, like, Service Broker, or Resource Governor, or Affinity Masking, or Priority Boost, or… I'm getting carried away. Apologies; Parallelism riles me.\n\nAnyway, I hope you enjoyed these, and I hope that you'll give other database systems a look. There's some pretty cool stuff out there."}

The draft strategy paper, which officials said was still being fine-tuned at the White House, describes the threat from Islamic militant groups in stark tones.\n\nIt remains to be seen how Trump can square his goal of avoiding military interventions with ongoing conflicts involving U.S. troops in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen and elsewhere.\n\nRather than scale back U.S. commitments, he has so far largely adhered to former Obama administration plans to intensify military operations against militant groups and granted the Pentagon greater authority to strike them in places like Yemen and Somalia.\n\nTrump may soon reverse years of Obama-ordered drawdowns in Afghanistan. His administration is now considering boosting by 3,000 to 5,000 soldiers the 8,400-strong U.S. contingent helping Afghan forces fight a resurgent Taliban, current and former U.S. officials say.\n\nA senior administration official noted that only a small number of troops have been added to U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria under Trump, at the discretion of his military commanders.\n\n\"If you do see additions elsewhere, they will be in keeping with this (draft) strategy,\" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The latest came in Somalia, where a Navy SEAL died and two others were wounded in an attack by al Shabaab militants, U.S. officials said on\n\nFriday.\n\nSince President Barack Obama released the last U.S. counterterrorism strategy in 2011 before the emergence of Islamic State, the threat has \"diversified in size, scope and complexity from what we faced just a few years ago,\" the draft strategy said.\n\nIn addition to Islamic State, the United States and its allies are endangered by a reconstituted al Qaeda, groups such as the Haqqani network and Hezbollah, as well as from homegrown extremists radicalized online, it said.\n\nBruce Hoffman, director of Georgetown University's Center for Security Studies and who reviewed the document at Reuters' request, said the draft strategy \"paints - and I think accurately - a more dire picture\" of the threat than the Obama document, which sounded a \"triumphalist\" tone following al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden's death in a 2011 U.S. raid in Pakistan."}
{"text": "Sweden was the original inspiration for the Conservatives' free schools. But now, as the Tories plan to step up the pace, that country is plunging down the league table of learning\n\nThe concept of evidence is not, it seems, on the curriculum at the top-notch schools that educate Britain's leaders. George Osborne cut the 50% top tax rate before it had bedded in, so that the data was still distorted by wealthy people paying themselves early to avoid its effect. The bedroom tax, a government-commissioned analysis found last year, is failing in its purported purpose of encouraging tenants to move out of unnecessarily large homes: fewer than one in 20 has done so. No matter, the policy rolls on.\n\nThen there is schooling, where Michael Gove's wholesale revolution in governance was rushed through without considering the questions of those awkward sorts that the Bush White House used to dismiss as \"reality-based communities\" – questions about whether the stampede to open free schools and confer academy status would make things better or worse. Now, however, the OECD – the rich-country club which can hardly be dismissed as part of the educational \"blob\" that Mr Gove used to set himself against – brings worrying news about the country that the former education secretary used to describe as his inspiration.\n\nSweden, a frequently-used but frequently misleading byword for a social democratic nirvana, began experimenting with publicly funded \"independent\" schools over 20 years ago. Over time nagging doubts grew about whether these islands of educational autonomy were working to increase segregation, both between the social classes and between immigrants and nationals. Steadily, however, they became entrenched as part of the system and were for the most part accepted as a useful bit of grit in the oyster when it came to raising average standards. Not any more, however.\n\nReviewing the best comparative evidence, the OECD describes \"a decade of declining ... performance\". Scores for reading, maths and science are all on the slide, and overall the Nordic state has declined from \"around average\" to \"significantly below average\" in the global league table of learning, a bigger drop than any other country has seen. Of course many things besides the Swedish version of the free schools programme have been going on during these years, including immigration and a widening of Sweden's traditionally narrow income gap. It would be foolish to pretend that everything can be blamed on the shift to \"contestable\" educational provision. But it would be equally rash to brush off this cautionary tale, which, at the least, suggests that creating hundreds of independent institutions offers scant protection against a slide in standards.\n\nThe OECD suggests that increasing the attractiveness of the teaching profession, improving pedagogical leadership and investing in professional development might be more fruitful avenues to pursue. The Conservative manifesto, however, does not propose to see how the first 250 free schools already created turn out. Instead, at a time of rising demographic and financial pressures, it commits to create 500 more. Open minds and patient study are two preconditions of successful learning. Both would appear to be in short supply in today's Tory party."}
{"text": "Compared to other countries, Chile is almost all coast, and that geographical fluke means that the country is known for its beautiful beaches. But that reputation may be on the wane thanks to a new sight on Chilean shores: dead animals. Lots of them. Heaps of them, in fact. As Giovanna Fleitas reports for the Agence France-Presse, the South American country's beaches are covered with piles of dead sea creatures—and scientists are trying to figure out why.\n\nTales of dead animals washing up on shore are relatively common; after all, the ocean has a weird way of depositing its dead on shore. But Chile's problem is getting slightly out of hand. As Fleitas writes, recent months have not been kind to the Chilean coast, which has played host to washed-up carcasses of over 300 whales, 8,000 tons of sardines, and nearly 12 percent of the country's annual salmon catch, to name a few.\n\nWave of dead sea creatures hits Chile's beaches https://t.co/DhQsCjql4V pic.twitter.com/QpX6iRPrLl — AFP news agency (@AFP) May 4, 2016\n\nAt least some of the damage to fish appears to be due to fish farming, which encourages toxic algal blooms. But as with so many strange sea phenomena in the last year, El Niño, which warms the equatorial Pacific, appears to be at least partly to blame. The warm water brought on by the phenomenon put stress on coral reefs near Hawaii and appears to have delayed the arrival of whales to the islands. Meanwhile, off the shores of Chile, the warm water appears to have provided great conditions for toxic algae. The blooming creatures poison fish and other marine life that eat them, and this year the bloom is blamed for losses of nearly a billion dollars among Chilean fishers.\n\nAlgae also suck oxygen from the water itself—a change to which Pacific Ocean creatures appear to be particularly vulnerable. In a newly published paper in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, researchers warn that declining oxygen levels worldwide kill animals, but that the diversity of life in the Pacific Ocean is at particular risk. That long-term danger isn't helped by algae that blooms in response to short-term phenomena like El Niño.\n\nThe rising tide of dead animals is raising health concerns, as when thousands of squid washed up on shore earlier this year. At the time, reports Latin Correspondent's Steven James Grattan, health officials were criticized for not clearing coasts of about 10,000 rotting, dead squid sooner. (They eventually did so with the help of heavy equipment.)\n\nSo how should Chile get rid of the rest of the festering fish and withering whales on its once-pristine shores? WIRED's Sarah Zhang has some advice for those faced with a dead whale: \"Don't blow it up.\" Instead, she recommends that scientists study the carcasses and take chunks back to their labs...or bury the whales on the beach where they met their sad, smelly end."}

{"text": "Two Mexican flags popped up at a most unexpected place – near a golf course in Scotland. The flags were flown near one of the GOP presidential presumptive nominee's golf courses in the Scottish Lowlands.\n\nTrump is scheduled to visit Scotland on Friday.\n\nIt appears the flags were raised as much in protest of the golf courses owned by Mr. Trump as against his candidacy for the presidency. \"We did this to coincide with his visit to show solidarity with the Mexican people and many other groups that Donald Trump has lied to and intimidated, because we've experienced it,\" David Milne said to ABC News' Good Morning America reporter Louise Dewast.\n\nOne of the two residents flying the green, white and red flag of Mexico on Scottish soil said the action was taken \"in sign of solidarity with the people of Mexico.\"\n\nMr. Milne owns property that is adjacent to one of Trumps golf courses. He has gone as far as forming an advocacy group that has campaigned against Trumps course. He said it was \"the most obvious symbol\" because of Trumps pledge to build a wall along the U.S. southwestern border and his comments that have been largely misconstrued by the left-of-center American news media about criminal illegal aliens who are pouring into the U.S.\n\nMilne's beef with Trump seems to center around the idea that the wealthy commercial developer has allegedly tried to force local residents to sell their property. A claim that was promptly denied by Trump's Scottish company's executive vice president, Sarah Malone.\n\n\"I would categorically dispute any claims that we have purposely made life difficult for the neighbors or done things that were wrong,\" she told NPR's Leila Fadel in Frebruary. \"We simply haven't.\"\n\nThe second Mexican flag was reportedly flown by Michael Forbes, another resident who protestes against the course being built.\n\nThis is certainly not the first time a Mexican flag has been raised in a foreign country to protest Trump's presidential campaign. Breitbart Texas reported in April about a Canadian citizen, former Mexican citizen, construction worker who draped the Mexican flag from the top of the Trump International Hotel which is under construction in Vancouver, Canada.\n\nThe freshly naturalized Canadian citizen took the action \"because from the concrete pouring, finishing, drywall, taping, wood forming and general labor, Mexicans were there, building it, doing good work,\" ABC News quoted from his Facebook page.\n\nTrump is travelling to Scotland this week to visit his two golf courses located in the Scottish Lowlands. He will attend the re-opening of the Turnberry course located in Ayrshire along the Firth of Clyde, southwest of Glasgow. He is scheduled to visit the Trump International Golf Links in Aberdeenshire on Saturday. This course is located diagonally across the country along the North Sea coast north of Aberdeen.\n\nMexican flags are routinely seen being carried at Trump protests in the United States.\n\nBob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas and is a member of the original Breitbart Texas team.

{"text": "Coming off a total collapse at LSU last weekend, the Auburn Tigers did exactly what they set out to do in Fayetteville on Saturday night, trouncing Arkansas 52-20.\n\nFor coach Gus Malzahn, it was a much needed victory to take some of the heat off himself after his Tigers blew a 20-0 lead in Baton Rouge. The Tigers are now 6-2 overall and are still alive in the SEC West race at 4-1.\n\nHowever, just because the Tigers won big Saturday doesn't mean it was a clean game, as Auburn still has plenty to work on moving forward.\n\nWith games still remaining against Texas A&M, Georgia and Alabama in the next few weeks, Malzahn and his staff need to make a few changes and shore up a few areas.\n\nHere are three big things that Auburn needs to fix:\n\nThe defense is susceptible to big plays\n\nThe Tigers played well on defense, holding the Razorbacks to 20 points (seven of which came on a kickoff return).\n\nHowever, Auburn still allowed 10 plays of 15 yards or more. Against a team like Arkansas, that's worrisome, as there are squads with better offenses remaining on the Tigers' schedule.\n\nIf defensive coordinator Kevin Steele can't shore up the holes, Georgia and Alabama are going to torch the Tigers.\n\nThe kick coverage team needs to be better\n\nFortunately, the Tigers have Daniel Carlson as their kicker, otherwise kickoff coverage might be an even bigger problem.\n\nThe Razorbacks only attempted one kickoff return, and De'Vion Warren went 100 yards for a touchdown.\n\nCarlson can't kick every ball out of the back of the end zone, so at some point, the Tigers are going to need to make some tackles on kickoffs against some talented returners.\n\nThe lapse didn't hurt the Tigers on Saturday night, but it did take some of the shine off of the preceding Auburn touchdown, which came on an incredible reverse pass by WR Ryan Davis to WR Darius Slayton.\n\nChip Lindsey's play calling is still too predictable\n\nThough first-year offensive coordinator Chip Lindsey had a better effort against the Razorbacks than he did against LSU last week, his play-calling still left a lot to be desired.\n\nAfter running it 17 straight times on first downs in the second half of last week's loss, Lindsey did an incredibly predictable thing by throwing it on Auburn's first play of the Arkansas game (an incompletion, naturally).\n\nEven when things were working against the hopeless Arkansas defense, they weren't working because of the defenders being fooled — Auburn is just better than Arkansas.\n\nOther than the trick play mentioned above, the Tigers' offense wasn't exactly creative in Fayetteville.\n\nDown near the goal line late in the first half, Lindsey dialed up a couple of runs for star RB Kerryon Johnson — which is normally a good idea. However, having Johnson plunge straight into the heart of the Arkansas defense twice in a row is the sort of unimaginative play-calling that's going to hurt the Tigers down the stretch."}
{"text": "With that in mind, I told him that I thought what he was saying was new and interesting and that I wanted to interview him about it. He said he liked the idea and promised that we would talk after he finished lunch. I went back to my table with Mr. Ruddy and two other guests he had for lunch: Andrew J. Stein, a former Manhattan borough president, and Lee Lipton, a local restaurant owner.\n\nFive minutes later, I heard the president call my name.\n\n\"Michael, come on, Michael,\" he said as he stood up.\n\n\"Come on, sit over there,\" he said as he motioned to a large empty table.\n\nWe sat down next to each other, I asked whether he was O.K. with me recording, he agreed and we were off. Mr. Trump immediately told me that there was no collusion between his associates and Russia's effort to influence the election — something he would repeat 15 more times during the interview.\n\nIt is unusual to land an interview with the president, but even more rare for a reporter to get him one-on-one. I knew that what I was doing was not going to go over well with the White House press office, which hates being blindsided by the president making news. But for much of the next half-hour, Mr. Trump and I sat alone.\n\nDuring our conversation in July, I learned the challenges this president poses in interviews. He can jump from an issue like the Russia investigation to a policy matter before going off on a tangent about something like his golf game. If you try to interrupt him, he often continues talking. Given this, I employed a strategy in which I asked questions about the most pressing issues of his presidency and then allowed him to talk.\n\nSome readers criticized my approach, saying I should have asked more follow-up questions. I believed it was more important to continue to allow the president to speak and let people make their own judgments about his statements. It was the best way to learn as much as possible about the president's mind-set and his views on issues like North Korea.\n\nIn the interview, the president did make news. He contradicted members of his own party, saying he believes the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, will treat him fairly. He said for the first time explicitly that he had gone soft on trade with China in the hopes that Beijing would help put pressure on North Korea to stop its nuclear weapons program. And he said that he never thought Roy Moore would win the Senate race in Alabama and that he had endorsed Mr. Moore only out of obligation.\n\nAt the end of the interview, Mr. Trump, who had asked about my golf game, told me that I should go out and play his course that afternoon. I told him I would not do that and I needed to file a story off the interview on deadline. He asked me to treat him fairly, we shook hands and I headed for my rental car. As I drove away from the club, I called my editors to tell them I had just spent half an hour alone with the president."}
{"text": "It can happen to anyone at any time. One minute you're feeling an indescribable vibrancy and next an emptiness. It has sidelined the most talented cuppers in the field for minutes; hours in more severe cases. We are talking about the world of professional coffee tasting and it's most common ailment–palate fatigue!\n\nProfessional coffee tasters, like our own Paul Massard and Stormin' Norman, put their taste buds on the line every day by cupping coffee for hours. With the daily cupping process come hazards and risks like burnt tongues, self-inflicted tongue bites and worst of all, palate fatigue.\n\nWhat is palate fatigue?\n\nAlso known as taste bud exhaustion or sensory enervation, palate fatigue occurs when tasting a multitude of comparable products consecutively. In the realm of coffee, palate fatigue often strikes during the cupping process. During a cupping, slurping and slurping for hours on end could take a toll on your ability to distinguish between the different flavor notes of coffee.\n\nWhy does palate fatigue happen?\n\nMany believe that palate fatigue occurs when your nose and taste buds are simply overworked. But researchers believe otherwise. Their theory is that your brain, not the sensory receptors on your tongue, becomes fatigued with similar sensory information. This is a more solid theory because our brains function like computers. When we experience something with our senses, it sends a data signal to the brain. The brain then decodes the data into a sensory profile we can then experience. When multiple similar data signals are sent in rapid succession, the brain begins to mix up the signals and creates false readings (AKA palate fatigue).\n\nAre there other types of palate fatigue?\n\nAs a consumer, you've probably experienced a condition very similar to coffee palate fatigue at your local department store's fragrance section. After sniffing several different fragrance cards, they all start to smell the same. This is a form of palate fatigue that affects the nasal palate (it just so happens that coffee is the palate cleanser to smell when trying on perfumes. What a coincidence!).\n\nHow does one prevail against palate fatigue?\n\nThe simple answer is to just take a break from tasting–give your brain a chance to clear its cache.\n\nIf you don't have the luxury of time, do what the pros do and employ a palate cleanser.\n\nLastly, as any athlete will tell you, the best way to prevent exhaustion is through conditioning and endurance. The most physically fit palates often belong to Q graders and chefs. This is because experts have spent years conditioning their palates with High Volume Taste Training (or HVTT).\n\nPalate fatigue knows no bounds; the key is to stop it before it (for lack of a better term) leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Be prepared!

{"text": "We're in the midst of an outbreak of debate, people arguing the merits of vaccinations. Its symptoms include feverish rhetoric and noxious op-eds. In an attempt to stem the spread of unhealthy attitudes toward science and misinformation about vaccines, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation sponsored the creation of 38 works of art, by the likes of Annie Leibovitz, Mia Farrow, and Cristoph Nieman, to educate people about the power of these drugs.\n\nOne of the works, Flowers, by Vik Muniz and Tal Danino, is unique in that the medium is the message. The print, which resembles floral wall paper, is made from liver cells that have been treated with smallpox vaccine.\n\nSmallpox infected liver cells become a beautiful flower pattern at a distance. Photo: Vik Muniz\n\nTo create the microscopic masterpieces, Muniz and Danino, with MIT professor Sangeeta Bhatia, designed a pattern and turned it into a rubber stamp that could deposit a thin layer of collagen onto a petri dish. Cells, usually from the liver, are added; they thrive on the collagen, then perish on plastic and are photographed. \"People are quite surprised to realize that the images are made up of real cancer/liver cells and real viruses,\" says Danino, \"They are not photoshopped. They are equally struck by the fact that beyond the photograph, the cells are alive, move around, and fluoresce.\"\n\nCreating images with unconventional materials is nothing new for Muniz, who has fashioned portraits of Civil War veterans using plastic toy soldiers and homages to the Mona Lisa from peanut butter and jelly. He's worked with MIT scientists in the past to turn bacteria, viruses, and mold into works of art.\n\n\"I always work with scientists because I think we're trying to do the same thing,\" Muniz says in a video accompanying the project. \"It's a beautiful thing that a vaccine is actually made out of poison. I find this fascinating, it's poetic.\"\n\nViewers can find something of interest at any scale. Photo: Vik Muniz\n\nThe images are beautiful, but more importantly, the concept of arbitrarily controlling the shape and movement of cells could have more practical applications in science. \"With the experience and techniques we learned from this approach, we hope to publish this technique and use it in subsequent studies where we want control over specific forms of cells and bacteria to study their spatial and temporal behaviors,\" says Danino.\n\nArtists are known to suffer for their work, but working around pathogens is not to be taken lightly. \"There is a danger to working with pathogens and cancer cells in the lab, but we have rigorous safety standards and practices to minimize risk,\" says Danino. \"Some of these include working with lab coats, gloves, in laminar flow hoods, et cetera.\"\n\nVaccines are an undeniably cool way to make art, but has it helped any of Jenny McCarthy's acolytes see the light? Danino can't answer that. \"I don't know any anti-vaccine people,\" he says."}
{"text": "Worm snails\n\nFamily Vermetidae\n\nupdated Oct 2016 if you learn only 3 things about them ...\n\nAlthough they look like worms, they are actually snails!\n\nThey filter feed at high tide, gathering bits with a 'net'.\n\nLook for them on large boulders and other hard surfaces.\n\nWhere seen? These odd-looking snails are seen coiled on rocks, stones and other hard surfaces. Commonly seen on our Northern shores. Some snails of the Family Turritellidae also build coiling shells.\n\n\nFeatures: Tube opening 1-2cm in diameter, coils 10cm long or more. This amazing snail is NOT a worm. It builds a thin hard tube on hard surfaces. The worm snail has a pair of short thick tentacles, and a short foot. Some species of worm snails have a thin operculum attached to the foot that is used to seal the shell opening, others don't. As young snails, the shell they produce appears 'normal', and are free-living and unattached. But they soon attach to a hard surface and the shell produced becomes meandering and coiling.\n\n\nSometimes confused with keelworms (Phylum Annelida, Class Polychaeta) which are segmented worms that also build coiling hard shells on hard surfaces. Tubes made by worms such as keelworms are dull on the inside and made up of two layers. Tube worms have segmented bodies. Tubes made by snails such as vermetids are glossy on the inside because of a deposit of nacre, and made up of three layers. Vermetid snails do not have segmented bodies. Here's more on how to tell apart animals that make hard coiling tubes.\n\n\nWhat does it eat? A worm snail 'nets' food from the water. A sticky mucus net is secreted from a gland near the foot. This net can extend many times the body length. Elsewhere, it was observed that a vermetid snail with a tube diameter of 5cm had a mucus net 2m long! The animal gathers the mucus and eats it together with whatever tasty bits are stuck on it. The vermetid snail's digestive system is more similar to that of bivalves than other gastropods.\n\n\nWorm snail babies: Male worm snails release their sperm in packets. Female worm snails 'net' these sperm packets in the same way that they gather food. As the sperm packets are hauled near the female's body, the sperm is released from the packet. Or the female may store the sperm to fertilise the eggs later. Eggs are retained inside the tube. They don't have a free-swimming stage and emerge out of the tube as little snails. After crawling about briefly, they cement themselves to a hard surface.\n\n\nHuman uses: In Polynesia, they are a traditional food of some coastal people.\n\n\nPulau Sekudu, Jul 05\n\n\nPunggol, Jun 12\n\n\nFeeding with mucus strands?\n\nRaffles Marina, Jun 02"}

Officials are taking no chances with just hours left to prepare before the storm makes landfall.\n\nMajor oil producers, including BP, Shell and Chevron, said Sunday they would be evacuating workers from Gulf of Mexico platforms in the face of an imminent threat of high surf and winds from Tropical Storm Isaac.\n\nThe storm could affect an area that produces 23 percent of total daily U.S. oil production and 7 percent of its natural gas output.\n\nBP Plc said it will shut production at all of its Gulf of Mexico oil and gas platforms and evacuate all workers on Sunday in light of Isaac's westerly shift and forecasts that it could strengthen into a hurricane. BP has already shut and evacuated four platforms, including Thunder Horse, the world's largest. The company said Sunday it will shut its other three platforms.\n\nChevron, second to BP in Gulf oil production, said it would be evacuating some workers directly involved in oil and gas production from some of its platforms. \"Chevron continues to closely monitor the projected path of Tropical Storm Isaac and has begun to evacuate some essential personnel from some offshore facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. Production has not been affected,\" the company said.\n\nAnadarko Petroleum followed suit. \"To ensure the safety of our workers and the protection of the environment, we are shutting in production and removing all personnel from our operated facilities in the eastern and central Gulf of Mexico,\" it said in a statement. Among the platforms it is shutting are: the Independence Hub, Constitution, Marco Polo, Red Hawk, Neptune and Gunnison.\n\nReuters said Murphy Oil was evacuating its Thunder Hawk platform Sunday and would do the same with two other platforms on Monday. Royal Dutch Shell said it will shut down production and fully evacuate its platforms on Monday, according to the news agency. Others who are evacuating workers include Marathon Oil and BHP Billiton.\n\nThe Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said the storm threat has so far shut down about a quarter of daily oil production in the Gulf and over 8 percent of its natural gas production.\n\nIsaac is heading for the Gulf Coast, say forecasters, who predict the storm is likely to build into a Category 2 hurricane capable of sustained winds between 96 to 100 miles per hour. It could make landfall on the northern Gulf Coast by late Tuesday. The storm picked up strength as it passed over the warm waters of the Florida Straits after it lashed Cuba and left seven dead in Haiti.\n\nRelated story: Isaac strengthens, set to hit Gulf Coast as Category 2 storm\n\nMemories are still fresh on the Gulf Coast over the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, which killed 11 platform workers and spewed millions of gallons of crude over three months into the environmentally sensitive Gulf of Mexico. The disaster, which was the largest marine oil spill ever, occurred after an explosion on the platform.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.\n\nMore money and business news:\n\nFollow NBCNews.com business on Twitter and Facebook"}

We have some significant bills in front of us and our focus is right now to pass those bills.\"\n\nOpposition questions motives\n\nThe opposition parties suggested the Liberal government might want to prorogue to avoid question period.\n\n\"They're mired in waste, mismanagement and scandal and I think that's the real reason this government wants to run, but it won't be able to hide from the people of Ontario,\" said Progressive Conservative Vic Fedeli.\n\nThe government has been on the receiving end of criticism in question period for its partial sale and privatization of Hydro One, and more recently changes in the budget to seniors' drug costs that the opposition says will leave most seniors in the province paying more. Wynne has said she will reconsider the changes.\n\nNDP Leader Andrea Horwath said the government \"has been everything but transparent and open,\" such as ignoring the public outcry to the sale of Hydro One and feedback on budget consultations.\n\n\"They are simply deciding that they don't have to account to anyone,\" she said. \"This is the place of accounting. This is the place where the opposition holds the government to account on what people are saying are problems in this province.\"\n\nThere is also growing speculation Wynne will shuffle her cabinet at some point this year, since she has not made any substantive changes since the 2014 election.\n\nProrogation can be a standard tool for governments, but former prime minister Stephen Harper sparked vigorous debate after he prorogued in late 2008, when his minority government faced the spectre of being unseated by an opposition coalition.\n\nIn October 2012, after increasing criticism over the costly decision to cancel the plants, former premier Dalton McGuinty abruptly announced a plan to resign as premier and prorogued the legislature. It was done to allow for a cooling off period after a bitter contempt of parliament debate erupted in the legislature over his energy minister's refusal to produce all documents related to the plants."}
{"text": "In newly filed campaign disclosure forms, President Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign committee has revealed that it paid a $50,000 retainer to criminal defense attorney Alan S. Futerfas who represents the president's son Donald Trump Jr. The timing of the payment is certainly raising eyebrows. Trump claimed he found out about the controversial meeting his son held with a Kremlin-linked lawyer around the time the New York Times first reported it, but the payment to Trump Jr.'s lawyer was made eleven days before.\n\nAccording to the disclosure forms, Trump's presidential campaign made a $50,000 payment to Futerfas' law firm on June 27, 2017. The first story about Trump Jr.'s meeting with lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya went up on the New York Times website on July 8, 2017, 11 days after the payment was made. On July 12, in an exchange with reporters on Air Force One en route to Paris, Trump said, \"I only heard about it [Trump Jr's meeting with the Russian lawyer] two or three days ago.\"\n\nA report from Yahoo News this week revealed that Trump's lawyers knew about the email chain between Trump Jr. and music publicist Rob Goldstone for weeks. According to the Yahoo News report, Trump's lead attorney, Marc Kasowitz and Alan Garten, general counsel of the Trump organization, found out about the now infamous email exchange the third week of June. The payment from Trump's committee was made the fourth week of June.\n\nTrump is known to be careful with spending, monitoring expenses closely and grousing when too much money is spent. The fact that a $50,000 payment, to a criminal defense attorney that represents his son on a matter related to the Russia investigation, could be made by a campaign committee he controls without his knowledge would certainly be surprising according to two sources familiar with Trump's oversight of campaign expenses.\n\nA spokesman for Trump's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\nThe use of campaign funds to pay for Trump Jr.'s personal legal bills is also eyebrow raising. President Trump claims he is worth $10 billion dollars (Bloomberg News says he is worth $2.86 billion and Forbes says he is worth $3.5 billion). A majority of Trump's campaign donations come from low-dollar donors, the type that give less than $100. That a family worth billions is using campaign committee funds to pay personal legal bills is not something that is likely to go over well with Trump's base in the long-run.\n\nThe expenditure appears to be legal though. Lawrence Noble, who served as general counsel of the Federal Elections Commission and currently serves as general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center told HuffPost if Futerfas' representation of Trump Jr. is strictly related to matters pertaining to the presidential campaign then it is permissible to pay him from the campaign committee.\n\nBut if the investigation turns to noncampaign matters, as some have speculated it might given that special counsel Robert Mueller has broad investigative powers, it would not be legal for the Trump campaign to cover Trump Jr.'s legal bills.\n\nA copy of the campaign disclosure is shown below:"}

If you are interested in my actual research area, please see my current research blog sustainingknowledgecommons.org The Reed Elsevier annual report was published in March. One highlight of interest in the area of scholarly publishing is the revenue and adjusted operating profit for the Scientific, Technical & Medical portion of the business. STM 2013 revenue: £2,126 million STM 2013 adjusted operating profit: £826 million That's a profit margin of 39%! Revenue is up 1% from 2012, while profit is up 6% from 2012 (Reed Elsevier 2014, p. 12). Elsevier's profit increased from £780 million in 2012 to £826 million in 2013. That's an increase in profit alone of £46 million, or $76 million in U.S. dollars. As I've explained elsewhere (Morrison, 2013), the vast majority of revenue for scholarly journals comes from academic library budgets. Surely universities have better things to do with this kind of money than further increasing the profits of already highly profitable publishers? For example: $76 million dollars in extra profits to Elsevier could fund 760 academic positions at a rate of $100,000 per year - and this wouldn't even touch Elsevier's previously high profit rate! $76 million dollars in extra profits to Elsevier could fund over 12,000 student research assistantships at a rate of $6,000 each.

Last week, the retailer reported a surprise third-straight quarter of U.S. same-stores declines.\n\n\"Black Friday is our Super Bowl, and we plan to win,\" said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart U.S., on Tuesday. He repeated the \"why\" part as well: six fewer shopping days from Thanksgiving to Christmas this year.\n\nStarting Tuesday, Wal-Mart will also extend its Christmas Ad Match to online customers. Shoppers who buy an item online and find a lower in-store competitor price can recoup the difference via a Wal-Mart gift card by emailing christmasadmatch@walmart.com. That policy has been in place for in-store shoppers, and it runs up to Dec. 24, excluding Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday.\n\nAmong the latest Wal-Mart offers: a LeapPad 2 for $39.99, dropped from $79, a Monopoly Board Game for $5 (from $7.77) and PS4 and Xbox video games, such as \"Call of Duty Ghosts\" and \"Battlefield 4\", down to $49 from $59.96.\n\nThere's no sign yet of how the other retailers plan to respond. But no doubt, if Wal-Mart is offering big sales this Friday, watch this space, as competitors' marketing teams scramble. Some analysts say none of this will save the holiday season, as fewer shoppers are expected to hit the stores and the Internet. Industry researchers such as Shopper Trek predict just a 2.4% rise in holiday sales this year.\n\nWal-Mart has been the subject of other news headlines this week. There's talk of a national Black Friday boycott of the retailer, it's in hot water over a Thanksgiving food drive for employees, and it's facing potential lawsuits over 117 fired employees.\n\n— Barbara Kollmeyer\n\nFollow this reporter @bkollmeyer\n\nFollow The Tell blog @thetellblog"}

The CQC found, \"little internal or clear external oversight of how the trust managed risks to the quality of care\"; a lack of \"clarity or coherence\" over who was \"responsible for the oversight and scrutiny of the trust's quality agenda\"; poor hygiene standards; \"poor care provided to patients\", and, perhaps most damning of all, a \"blame approach, rather than that of a supportive and patient focused approach\".\n\nCircle had been held up as a shining example of a private company stepping in to triumph where the NHS had failed. It's impossible to see how this rhetoric can be maintained with any integrity given this monumental failure; the privatisation experiment is unravelling before our eyes.\n\nAnd what's striking about this example is that it is not only a failure of patient care standards, but in hard-nosed economics as well. As I pointed out in October, one of the many severe consequences of marketisation – one totally overlooked in Simon Stevens' big rescue plan – is that when private companies bin their contracts with the NHS in such a self-serving fashion, it is the trusts' time and precious taxpayer funds that end up being wasted on picking up the pieces.\n\nWhat cost will Circle's walking away be to Cambridgeshire and Peterborough? I shudder to think. And, thanks to the Health and Social Care Act, the next chapter in this woeful saga will have to be another gruelling and costly tendering process, administrated by the trust.\n\nAnd it goes full circle – if you'll excuse the pun. Why are A&E departments in crisis? It's extremely complex, but it would help if the limited resources trusts are being asked to survive on weren't wasted in such gross examples of false economics, and privatisation going so drastically wrong."}
{"text": "3 Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, Opal Tometi Activists From left: Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza, Opal Tometi. | Ben Baker for Politico Magazine/Redux Pictures\n\nOver the past year, thehashtag #BlackLivesMatter has turned into a rallying cry for racial justice, riding a wave of online buzz and public protest in the aftermath of demonstrations in Ferguson, Missouri, right into the everyday American lexicon. It might even be changing the way Americans think about race: Sixty percent now say there is more work to be done to give white and black people equal rights, up from 46 percent last year.\n\nHow did three words launch a modern-day civil rights movement? The phrase was coined in 2013, in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the death of the black 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. San Francisco-based Alicia Garza, an organizer with the National Domestic Workers' Alliance, took to social media after the news broke to write a love letter to black people on her Facebook page—a simple plea to come together in recognition that \"black lives matter.\" Her friend Patrisse Cullors, head of an advocacy organization for incarcerated people, repeated the line on her own social media accounts, this time adding a hashtag. Soon enough, the pair, along with their tech-savvy friend Opal Tometi, director of the Black Alliance for Just Immigration, had lit up the Web with a plea to acknowledge—and fix—the disproportionate apprehension, imprisonment and killing of black Americans by the police.\n\nWhile it started out as a way to mobilize demonstrations from New York to St. Louis in response to police violence against African-Americans, Black Lives Matter today has 26 chapters in the United States, Britain and Ghana, and represents a broad agenda of economic equality and criminal justice reform. The group connects activists and organizes protests—more than 900 to date—in a single network that has advanced one of the most vocal and visible news stories of the year: the intersection of police abuse and racial injustice.\n\nSocial media movements are prone to skepticism, but it's hard to imagine recent progress on criminal justice—from the White House task force on policing to the Justice Department's body camera initiative—happening without public pressure amplified by Black Lives Matter. In April, when a bystander captured footage of a cop shooting a fleeing black man in North Charleston, South Carolina, he turned to a Black Lives Matter member to help share the video. The officer was arrested and indicted for murder.\n\nNow, these three words are a sticking point in the 2016 presidential race. Ever since Democratic candidate Martin O'Malley declared that \"all lives matter,\" protesters identifying with the Black Lives Matter movement have stormed campaign events (or tried to) for O'Malley, Jeb Bush, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders to demand that the candidates acknowledge, and confront, institutional racism. (O'Malley later apologized.) Clinton, for one, says she is embracing the movement. \"We need to acknowledge some hard truths about race and justice,\" she wrote on her Facebook page this summer. \"Black lives matter.\""}

The cave is very mysterious and attractive, and the attractiveness increases if you are lucky maybe to see one of the sea bears. Stiniva is one of the most famous coves on Vis island, and certainly has the most unusual form. It is located on the south side of the island, bordered by high cliffs that leave only four meters close to the entrance from the sea. After passing through the \"door\" , it opens a beautiful rounded bay with a pebble beach. Stiniva was declared the most beautiful beach in Europe in 2015.

{"text": "The Bank of Canada hinted Wednesday that Canada's record low interest rates are going to stay right where they are for a long while yet.\n\nIn its latest policy decision, Canada's central bank kept its benchmark interest rate, what's known as the target for the overnight rate, steady at one per cent on Wednesday.\n\nThat's the rate that retail banks base their lending and saving rates for consumers on, and it's been kept at that level since September 2010.\n\nWednesday's policy decision is the next-to-last one for Mark Carney as head of the bank before he leaves to London to head up the Bank of England in June.\n\nThe Carney-led Bank of Canada has now kept the rate steady at one per cent for 21 consecutive policy meetings.\n\nDespite the lack of change, the bank suggested its outlook for the Canadian economy is actually a bit worse now than previously — a sign suggesting the bank is in no rush to raise rates and slow down growth.\n\n\"A material degree of slack has re-emerged in the Canadian economy,\" the bank said in a statement.\n\n\"Considerable monetary policy stimulus currently in place will likely remain appropriate for a period of time, after which some modest withdrawal will likely be required.\"\n\nIn its report released Wednesday, the Bank of Canada said that the Canadian economy is expected to grow by 1.5 per cent in 2013 — less than the two per cent that was forecast in its January report.\n\nThe economy is expected to pick up at 2.8 per cent growth in 2014 and 2.7 per cent growth in 2015, before reaching \"full capacity\" in mid-2015.\n\n\"Following a weak second half in 2012, growth in Canada is predicted to regain some momentum in 2013 as net exports pick up and business investment returns to more solid growth,\" Carney said in a prepared statement Wednesday.\n\nHe added that consumer spending is expected to grow at a modest pace, while housing is set to decline further.\n\nAlthough the interest rate remains unchanged for now, Carney said that it is likely to rise at some point in order to achieve the bank's target inflation rate of two per cent.\n\n\"After a period based on several factors which we list [including the evolution of the housing market and the evolution of household balances], the next move is likely to be up,\" Carney said.\n\nScotiabank economist Derek Holt told The Canadian Press that the country likely won't be hit with higher interest rates until 2015.\n\nThe tell-tale sign, he said, is that the bank pushed back the closure of the output gap to mid-2015. It had predicted in January that the economy would reach full capacity by the second half of 2014.\n\n\"That's a very strong signal that they are not in hike mode until at least 2015, and even then, it's not as if you get worried about inflation pressures instantly once you close off spare capacity — you need to get the economy into material excess demand and that can happen well after that,\" Holt said.\n\nThe Canadian dollar closed down Wednesday following the forecast, falling 0.58 of a cent to 97.41 cents US."}

Upon seeing the police officers, the man tried to run, but was soon captured. He will be taken back to Fortaleza.\n\nOf the eight male suspects arrested, four are teenagers and four are adults, Globo has reported.\n\nThough Brazil legalised same-sex marriage in 2013 and hosts the world's largest Pride celebration, LGBT attacks are upsettingly common.\n\nA survey earlier this year found that one LGBT person was killed every 25 hours in Brazil throughout 2016.\n\n144 of the victims were trans people, which translated to a hugely disproportional 42 percent of victims.\n\nFar more trans people are killed in Brazil than in any other individual country. Of the 295 trans people killed worldwide between October 2015 and September 2016, 123 were Brazilian.\n\nIndia, whose population is six times the size of Brazil's, saw six trans people murdered in the same time period, according to the Trans Murder Monitoring project.\n\nIf you believe that there should be tougher sentences for transphobic crimes in Brazil and around the world, please sign this petition."}
{"text": "That's according to a new political science study published today, which looked at the effect news outlets have on public discourse. While the findings may seem intuitive, this group of scholars—who work at Harvard, M.I.T., and the Florida State University—were able to show that whatever the media chooses to focus on has a profound impact on what people discuss in their everyday lives.\n\n\"What we wanted to do,\" says Benjamin Schneer, a co-author and political science professor at Florida State University, \"was figure out exactly what the effect of the media was on the national conversation.\" So the political scientists essentially teamed up with a group of small to medium-sized publications and coordinated coverage at set intervals of time. They then analyzed the social media conversations around those specific topics.\n\nProving Something That Intuitively Makes Sense\n\nEveryone loves to mock academic studies that prove the obvious, so it should be emphasized that this is no small feat. Historically, it's proven very difficult for social scientists to quantitively show the media's effect. \"It's actually really hard to measure how much of an impact the media has,\" says Schneer.\" For instance, if researchers are merely mapping what people are talking about, they are faced with a chicken versus egg problem. Which is to say, if simply looking at what's written compares to what people are talking about, it would be nearly impossible to disentangle whether media coverage follows public conversation or vice versa. To circumvent this issue, the team did something quite ingenious: they facilitated their own coverage. Since they created the topics written about, they could then track whether or not this new coverage created heightened social media conversation.\n\nThe methodology worked like this: Schneer and his colleagues teamed up with the Media Consortium–a network of independent publications–and recruited nearly 50 publications who agreed to tailor certain coverage around important subjects–including race, the environment, immigration, jobs, abortion, etc. Two to five outlets were told to write about the same subject and even asked to collaborate. The idea was to create a journalistic moment–one outlet may produce a story and another may write a follow-up to it. Or, they may work together on a series of stories focusing on the one subject. All the publications would work together to publicize the work. (Schneer compared these \"packets\" of coverage to the Paradise Papers.)\n\nThe outlets retained complete editorial control over the pieces, so long as they were about the given subject. But the researchers then requested that the articles be very specifically timed for publication. When they gave the green light, the news outlets would publish their stories and the political scientists analyzed all of Twitter to see if people were talking about the subject. They then compared the week the posts were published to a control week when there was no planned coverage of the subject to see if there was an increase in social dialogue.\n\nAnd the findings were impressive: Schneer and his colleagues found that when a cluster of stories was published, the national conversation about that subject–at least on Twitter–increased by about 63%. Which is to say, what the media covers had a profound impact on what Americans are talking about online."}
{"text": "Apart from cultural illiteracy and hate campaign in public space, such announcements also have some dynamics in the hyper-connected digital worlds of memes and social networks. Hence, the current wave of anti-Brahmin actions has to be understood in that context.\n\nLinguistic Ethnic Nationalism + Marxism = Secessionist Nazi Cults\n\nDravidian polity has consistently used the term Aryan as a racist slur against Tamil Brahmin communities. The official magazine of Dravidian movement proclaimed on 28-09-1955: \"If we are to lynch the Aryans in the middle of the roads in broad day light all day long, today none shall care to question that\". However, in reality that was not the case. The Tamil Nadu government, then led by K Kamaraj as chief minister, did not hesitate to take action against Dravidian propaganda demeaning the sacred thread.\n\nSubsequently, the cultural reality and strains of real politics made even Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) refrain from rabid anti-Brahmin rhetoric. In 1955, C N Annadurai, who later became chief minister, explained that if they could destroy caste system by destroying Brahmins – the same way Hitler did with the Jews – it would be \"sensible to an extent\". But, he explained that the caste system, which he described as 'Aryanism' had become a part of Tamil society at large, and hence they had to resort to campaigning without violent means.\n\nDeep down they had strong hatred for Hinduism, which despite all social stigmas, still provided a democratic religious system, and hence it was an obstacle to their totalitarian ideologies and theologies. So, anti-Brahminism is aimed not just at Brahmins, but its ultimate aim is to destroy Hinduism and Hindu communities. Naturally, institutional and anti-Brahmin political movements get support from Christian and Islamic expansionist forces.\n\nIn 1950s, a bishop from Madurai, in his book on church and Dravidian movement, called the movement a time bomb that they have developed to destroy Hinduism. In 2017, Mathimaran, a rabid anti-Hindu Dravidianist, who calls Subramania Bharati a 'Brahmin-Hindu supremacist' is a guest in Christian institutions. The remarkable consistency in supporting the worst forms of anti-Hindu racial hate ideologies by Christian institutions is telling.\n\nSoon after Tony Joseph wrote a distorted report in The Hindu on the Aryan invasion and migration question as being settled through genetics in favour of the invasion/migration hypothesis, WhatsApp messages started spreading in many groups. In one of the groups of my old collegemates, a friend shared a message she had received. It went like this: \"The report of Tony Joseph had struck terror in the hearts of Brahmins in Tamil Nadu as it conclusively exposing them as aliens to this land. The report proves Tamils to be the original inhabitants of the land.\" And it ended with the usual call to share: \"If you are born a true Tamil share this message with other Tamils and spread the awareness.\""}

Mr English made a statement to police in April last year and said Mr Barclay told him about the recording. Police closed the investigation into Mr Barclay after ten months, during which he refused to speak to them and denied the recording allegations.\n\nMr McCready said \"it is in the public interest\" to file charging documents against Mr Barclay, but it's \"conditional on the complainant and other witnesses giving sworn statements\" to the court to show the trial is warranted. He'd name Mr Barclay as \"the alleged principal offender\" and Mr English as \"either an alleged accessory or as a person who attempted to or did obstruct justice\".\n\nMr McCready has a long history of filing private litigations. He made an unsuccessful attempt over John Key's pony-tail gate saga in 2015, and in 2007 when Labour party MP Trevor Mallard was convicted of assaulting National MP Tau Henare in Parliament.\n\n'I don't think it'll work' - expert\n\nOtago University law professor Andrew Geddis is sceptical about Mr McCready's chances of success in prosecuting Mr Barclay.\n\n\"I don't think it'll work because he'll run into the same problem the police have run into. While we may in the court of public opinion draw certain conclusions about Todd Barclay's behaviour and what Bill English said about it and so on, those conclusions aren't the same as legal evidence that can establish guilt in criminal proceedings.\"\n\n\"I would be extraordinary surprised, based on what we know now, if the court allowed it to proceed.\"\n\nMr Geddis doubts that police will reopen the investigation into Mr Barclay, unless new evidence emerges or Mr Barclay decides to speak to police.\n\n\"What's really needed to reopen the investigation is new information and basically everything we've been finding out has come from the police files ... if police were to go back and reopen the investigation based on what we've heard it would raise real questions about why they didn't proceed in the first place. So I doubt it.\"\n\nHe said that the case was unlikely to be reopened unless they can get Barclay to effectively say \"yeah I did it\", or unless a tape emerges that can be tied back to Barclay.\n\nMr Barclay and Mr English have been contacted for comment.\n\nNewshub."}

This new policy stipulates that Indonesian coal miners need to obtain a 'listed exporter' status (Eksportir Terdaftar, ET) from the Energy and Mineral Resources ministry to export coal. The new rule applies to both PKP2B-holders and IUP-holders. However, many Indonesian miners many faced difficulty to obtain the new license amid a lack of clarity regarding the new legal framework. Therefore, the Indonesian government delayed implementation of the new policy by one month (initially the policy would come into effect starting on 1 September 2014).\n\nTo obtain the ET, Indonesian coal miners need to seek a recommendation from the Ministry for Energy and Mineral Resources first as stipulated by Regulation of the Director General of Mineral and Coal No 714 K/30/DJB/2014 (Peraturan Dirjen Minerba No 714 K/30/DJB/2014). To obtain the recommendation, the miner is required to show documents that prove it has met tax and royalty payment obligations. It is also mandatory to have the clean and clear certificate (CnC). This CnC certificate shows that the miner has no outstanding royalty and other tax debts, fulfilled exploration and environmental commitments, has no property delineation issues and obtained forestry permits.\n\nThis new policy is made in order to optimize state revenue from the coal mining industry and have more supervision on coal exports (illegal coal shipments are currently still a big problem).\n\nUp to September 2014, 137 Indonesian miners have requested for the recommendation of the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry, 47 of which have obtained the recommendation.\n\n\nChina's Coal Import Ban\n\n\nIt was reported that, starting from 2015, China may ban imports and local sales of coal that contains high levels of ash and sulphur in an attempt to tackle air pollution. This policy is expected to hit Australian miners the hardest as China, the world's second-largest economy, imported approximately 54 million metric tons of Australian thermal coal in 2013, most of which does not meet the newly proposed restrictions.\n\nHowever, the negative impact of this new policy on Indonesia, the world's major steam coal exporter, is limited as Indonesia mostly ships coal with low heating value, sulphur and ash content.\n\n\nShare this column\n\n‹ Back to Today's Headlines"}

They even believe he could defeat her in the nation's first nominating contest there. The enthusiasm Sanders has generated has called into question Clinton's early strategy of focusing on a listening tour of small groups and wooing big donors in private settings, the Times writes. \"We are worried about him, sure. He will be a serious force for the campaign, and I don't think that will diminish,\" said Jennifer Palmieri, the Clinton campaign's communications director, on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" on Monday.\n\nCarson's cash: Before Republican presidential hopeful Ben Carson was vying for votes from members of Christian organizations, he was charging them tens of thousands of dollars for speeches. As Politico writes, Carson brought in nearly $2 million delivering inspirational speeches to faith-based groups including Christian high schools and pregnancy centers in 2014. A Politico analysis of his financial disclosure form showed that four of his five most lucrative speeches were at such Christian venues. His speaking fees varied widely, from $12,320 to $48,500, according to the disclosures.\n\nThe next liberal cause: The Washington Post's Greg Sargent writes that Senate Democrats will soon roll out a new universal pre-kindergarten proposal. If it gets a vote, he says, it will put members of both parties on the record as to whether they support national action to dramatically expand the availability of child care to poor and working families. The proposal could be paid for by reining in corporate tax breaks, according to the Democrats. Specifically, the program would be funded by scaling back corporate \"inversions,\" in which companies declare their U.S. operations are owned by a subsidiary abroad. That results in profits being shifted to places where they are taxed at lower rates.\n\nTrump workers talk: Donald Trump's recent comments about drug dealers and rapists crossing into the U.S. from Mexico aren't sitting well with some of the workers building a new Trump hotel in downtown Washington.

{"text": "Contemporary photo of a cannon and embrasure at Fort Stevens\n\nQuick Facts Location: Washington, DC Significance: Civil War Fort Designation: National Park OPEN TO PUBLIC: Yes\n\nFort Stevens, now partially restored, was built to defend the approaches to Washington from the 7th Street Pike (now Georgia Avenue) which was then the main thoroughfare from the north into Washington. Originally called Fort Massachusetts by the soldiers from that state who constructed the fort, it was later named after Brig. Gen. Isaac Ingalls Stevens, who was killed at the Battle of Chantilly (Ox Hill), Virginia, September 1, 1862.\n\n\nBy the summer of 1864, the great bulk of Union troops in the east were engaged in siege operations around Petersburg, Virginia. In fact, when Ulysses S. Grant moved south in the Spring of 1864, he stripped Washington, D.C. of many well trained troops to add weight to his offensive. As a result, in July of 1864, there were only 9,000 troops to defend the city, down from over 23,000 the year before. Those that were left were primarily poorly trained reserves. Robert E. Lee was desperate to reduce the pressure on his forces around Petersburg, and so decided to send General Jubal A. Early and about 20,000 troops to strike at Washington which spies had reported was poorly defended.\n\n\nOn June 12, Early began his march north from Petersburg and by July 9, was at Frederick, Maryland, where he demanded and received $200,000 to spare the city. On the same day, Early defeated Union Gen. Lew Wallace at the Monocacy River. In the light of later events, Wallace's defeat after a stubborn fight became a victory for the Union because he was able to delay Early's advance for a day. On July 10, Early encamped at Rockville, Maryland, only 10 miles from Fort Stevens.\n\n\nReacting to this threat to Washington, Grant ordering the 25th New York Cavalry, the 1st and 2nd Divisions of the 6th Corps and part of XVIIII Corps to the capital on July 7. Leading elements of these units reached Fort Stevens at midnight of July 10, the same day Early reached Rockville.\n\n\nOver the following several days, Early probed Fort Stevens and its environs but never mounted a full-scale attack. Union reinforcements had reached Washington and Fort Stevens just in time.\n\n\nLocated atop the parapet of Fort Stevens is a commemorative stone dedicated to Abraham Lincoln. On July 12, 1864, the President stood atop the parapet to observe the fighting and came under fire from Confederate sharpshooters. It is the only time in American history in which a sitting president came under direct fire from an enemy combatant.\n\n\nIn the years to come, many individuals would claim the honor of advising the President Lincoln to come down from the parapet. The most notable was a young officer named Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. His remarks to the president were short and straightforward: \"Get down, you damn fool!\" Holmes would eventually serve as a justice on the U.S. Supreme Court, 1902-1932."}
{"text": "Today, it has become ubiquitous to see people, mostly women, wearing a fox tail with a medieval or renaissance costume. Ask them why they are wearing it and you'll probably be regaled with a story that, in history, it signified marital status, or perhaps even signified a somewhat licentious nature. You might also be told that the item is a 'flea fur' used to attract fleas off of the wearer's body (we'll deal with the myth of the flea fur in a future post).\n\nBut, is the wearing of fox tails proper in historic re-enactments specific to the 16th to 18th century?\n\nThere is some evidence that fox tails were being worn as undergarments in the 14th century. In Chronica Johannis de Reading et Anonymi Cantuariensis, John of Reading complains, in an entry dated 1344, that women were wearing clothes so tight that they wore a fox tail hanging down inside their skirts at the back to \"hide their arses.\" John of Reading equates this immodesty in dress with the sin of pride and complains that it will surely bring down future misfortune. (As quoted in The Black Death by Rosemary Horrox).\n\nComing to the 16th century, we do find surviving images of a fox tails being worn. Perhaps the most telling of these is The Cripples, painted by Peter Bruegel the Elder in 1568. Here we see disabled beggars adorned with fox tails covering their clothing.\n\nOther 15th and 16th century engravings by Bosch and Durer depict fools wearing fox tails at their belts, and ears upon their hoods. The English poet, Stephen Hawes, dresses his fool in \"a hood, a bell, a foxtayle and a bagge.\"\n\nThe French humanist Rabelais, in his work La vie de Gargantua et de Pantagruel, writes a character named Panurgi who mocks academics by sneaking upon them and hanging fox tails from their backs. This insult is effective because the fox tail is clearly associated in the 16th century mind with the fool.\n\nBy the 17th century, the first revolutionaries of Holland assumed the nickname of Les Gueux (The Ragamuffins) after the Count Berlaymont told the Duchess of Parma that they were \"the scum and offscouring of the people.\" Once this insult had been made public, the party adopted the nickname in defiance of the old order and began to dress as beggars, adopting a fox tail upon their garments instead of feathers.\n\nThus, we must conclude that fox tails, while appropriate for wearing in historic re-enactment, are not a symbol of sexuality or availability, but rather a symbol of vagrants and fools. Anyone choosing to adopt a fox tail in their garments at a re-enactment should be willing to accept such a societal role for their character. The re-enactor should further be prepared to explain the symbol they wear in the correct historic context, leaving aside any modern 'renaissance faire' symbolism with which the fox tail has become imbued.\n\nAdvertisements"}

(Supplied)\n\n\"This bill will reduce the high cost of borrowing for payday loans and help ensure that alternative financial assistance and short term credit options are available to all Albertans.\"\n\nExperts say payday loan customers are often the working poor. The annual percentage rate on some of these loans can work out to 600 per cent.\n\nOfficials say the bill could bring that rate down to a range of 88 to 130 per cent.\n\nJeff Loomis of Momentum, a group that works with low income Calgarians, says another proposed change that allows borrowers repay loans in installments will make a big difference.\n\nJeff Loomis of Momentum says installment payback might allow some people to get out of a 'debt trap.' (CBC)\n\n\"One of the big challenges with payday lending is someone would have to pay back the entire amount in two weeks, so for someone borrowing that money and having to pay that entire amount back, it's very difficult … if you're on a limited income,\" Loomis said.\n\n\"By moving to installment payments it makes it so people have more of a chance to get out of a debt trap.\"\n\nBill Baker of Cash Money, a U.S.-based payday lending company with 28 Alberta locations, tells CBC News the company is disappointed with the legislation, saying it goes too far.\n\n'\"The biggest thing that's concerning is that this is going to limit the availability of short term credit for folks in Alberta,\" Baker said.\n\nHe said it effectively reduces revenue by about 34 per cent and his company may have to close some locations.\n\nLisa Holmes is president of the Alberta Urban Municipalities Association.\n\nLisa Holmes of the Alberta Urban Municipalities Association says Bill 15 requires companies to disclose all costs up front, which is a good thing for consumers. (CBC)\n\nShe applauds the changes which would require companies to disclose all costs up front and explain financial options available to borrowers.\n\n\"The economy in Alberta is not the greatest right now,\" Holmes said.\n\n\"We're seeing more people that are laid off. More people will be accessing these types of loans and so this is an important way to be able to protect them in a proactive sense.\"\n\nThe lower rates could come into effect as early as the summer."}
{"text": "The Milwaukee Bucks made the right move in turning down the Minnesota Timberwolves' proposed trade for Khris Middleton.\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks like Ricky Rubio. That's a fact that has long been established, and Zach Lowe confirms as much in his recent piece about Rubio.\n\nThe Spanish point guard is often derided for being a non-shooter, and that's a legitimate gripe. But comparing him directly to Michael Carter-Williams is incorrect in multiple facets.\n\nRubio is a terrific floor general and on-ball defender, and far more consistent than Carter-Williams. He's also older, but only slightly. It's shortsighted to consider Rubio replacing MCW as a lateral move–it would be a definite improvement in terms of pure point guard play.\n\nThat fact along with the Bucks infatuation for Rubio makes it extra terrifying that the two teams talked at length about a trade that would've sent Rubio to Milwaukee, and that Khris Middleton was what Minnesota asked for.\n\nMiddleton for Rubio is an awful trade for the Milwaukee Bucks. They lose the only sure shooter on the team, and a guy who's shown vast improvement in every facet of his game who also happens to be under contract until 2020.\n\nEven though the Bucks trade record has been spotty recently, it's not difficult for any front office to turn down Rubio for Middleton. Things apparently got more interesting than that though, as the Timberwolves considered throwing in their protected 2016 first round draft pick.\n\nThe Timberwolves are currently the fifth-worst team in the NBA, with a 29 percent chance of getting a top three pick. The protection on that pick is unknown, but considering Minnesota's current draft spot it's not unlikely that it might've been a top one or two protected pick.\n\nThat's a chance for the Bucks to add two more talented rookies in the 2016 NBA Draft, which is tantalizing. But no draft pick is a sure thing, not even Ben Simmons.\n\nBut even if Simmons is a sure thing, the Timberwolves likely won't end up with the first overall pick necessary to take him. And even if the balls bounced right, if the Bucks acquired that pick and it had that top one protection than Minnesota would get both Simmons and Middleton.\n\nFrankly, with the growth that Khris Middleton has shown it's somewhat surprising that he was ever on the table in the first place. Lowe's piece does mention that Milwaukee retorted with a MCW for Rubio swap, and talks ended shortly thereafter.\n\nIt's encouraging that the Bucks front office thinks highly enough of Middleton to turn down what could be a great draft pick for him though. That's the most important part of this entire story.\n\nAlthough this season has turned into a setback, Milwaukee's braintrust has clearly decided that the team needs to retool, not rebuild. This core of Middleton, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker is good. Maybe even great.\n\nInstead of breaking that up for another shot at who-knows-what, the Milwaukee Bucks decided to stand pat in the face of adversity. That's unequivocally the right call in this situation."}
{"text": "(Mayor's Office)\n\nEric Garner died in police custody in part because for several decades the NYPD has doggedly enforced smaller, seemingly innocuous \"quality-of-life\" crimes. According to Mayor de Blasio and Police Commissioner Bratton, the NYPD will continue to strictly enforce laws against loosie peddlers and subway dancers. \"I can understand why any New Yorker may say, that's not such a big offense,\" de Blasio said. \"But a violation of the law is a violation of the law.\"\n\nCommissioner Bratton added, \"We need the public's help also to appreciate that when an officer does approach you to correct your behavior, that you respond. That's what democracy is all about.\"\n\nThe pair were speaking at a press conference to discuss the reforms they're putting in place after Garner's death, including a planned retraining of the entire NYPD, the CCRB study into chokeholds (\"Over the last two decades [the CCRB] has not played a particularly important role in this city, certainly not the role it was supposed to play,\" the mayor admitted), and continued conversations with community leaders.\n\nTimes reporter David Goodman asked what Bratton meant when he remarked shortly after his swearing-in that falling crime rates implied that \"the intrusion of police into citizens' lives should also diminish.\" Did this apply to open container laws and having two feet on the subway seat?\n\n\"I'm still trying to find the balance,\" Bratton said. \"I'm dealing with the Elmo craze in Times Square, or dealing with house parties you have 300 or 400 people showing up at 3 or 4 in the morning. We had three of those parties this past weekend that had extensive violence. At two of them people just started shooting. In the third instance, an AK-47 was found on the lawn when we responded.\"\n\nBratton added, \"Would you not want us to deal with that quality of life crime?\"\n\nLeft unsaid was the fact that the high number of minor marijuana arrests under Mayor Bloomberg's tenure have not budged since de Blasio took office. Bratton also responded to a bizarre question about \"onlooker interference\" in videos depicting police use of force (videos that were the subject of a recent federal lawsuit against the NYPD for violating citizens' rights, though the reporter didn't mention this).\n\n\"There is no denying that in some of the videos that what you see is interference on the part of onlookers, maybe relatives, maybe friends, who should not be interfering,\" Bratton said. \"That interference certainly exacerbates the situation.\"\n\nPretty stunning stat from NYPD transit bureau chief: 268 summonses, 94 arrests this year for \"littering violations\" in the transit system. — Matt Flegenheimer (@mattfleg) July 28, 2014\n\nEditor's Note: Due to a hasty transcription, we initially reported that Bratton said the following: \"It's important that when an officer does approach you to correct your behavior, that you respect them.

{"text": "The stress of being the new kid on the block may cause changes to the immune system, leaving the body vulnerable to getting sick, finds a new study on monkeys.\n\nResearchers knew that social stress of being the low female on the dominance totem pole induces social stress in monkeys, but Jenny Tung, an associate professor at Duke University, wanted to see how this stress impacted them physically.\n\n\"It's possible to actually change an individual's social status and in that way induce social stress in some individuals and not others,\" Tung told LiveScience. \"We extended prior work in rhesus macaques to the modern genomic era.\"\n\nManaging monkeys\n\nResearchers worked with 49 female rhesus macaque monkeys, placing them in new social environments in which they endured different levels of social stress. Ten new groups of five monkeys each were created, and a monkey's social status was determined by how early on they were placed into the group. The last monkeys to enter the group had the lowest social rank.\n\n\"Lower-ranking females are exposed to a different social environment. Day to day, they are subject to more stressful interactions,\" Tung said. \"There are particular threatening faces and gestures that female macaques can make to each other. They [the low-ranking females] tend to be the target of those threat gestures more often.\"\n\nBut the low-ranking females weren't being slapped, bitten or kicked, she said. Instead, Tung said, they suffer a \"social stress.\"\n\nThe researchers took the blood from each of these monkeys and analyzed it for differences in gene expression, which shows genes that are \"active\" and being turned into proteins. They saw big differences in genes related to the immune system and inflammation; these types of genes were expressed in much higher levels in the lowest-ranking individuals, indicating their immune systems were out of whack.\n\nSocial changes\n\nThe researchers also had a second set of blood samples collected from seven of the monkeys after they moved up the social ladder. They saw that it was the social stress that caused the changes in gene expression, not individual differences in immune gene patterns.\n\n\"We were able to find that with changes in social environment, you see the gene-expression pattern seems to change with it. If you can improve your social environment, then that gene signature seems to go away too,\" Tung said. This means that by improving their social status, the monkeys could also improve their health.\n\nPrevious research has also shown the effects of social stress in humans, including increased incidence of cardiovascular disease. Humans could very well also experience immune system changes in response to increased levels of social stress, Tung said.\n\n\"There's no direct parallel for macaque dominance ranks in humans, but we know that the social stress imposed by dominance ranks seems to have similar physiological effects as socioeconomic status or job ranks at work,\" Tung said.\n\nThe study was published today (April 9) in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nYou can follow LiveScience staff writer Jennifer Welsh on Twitter, on Google+ or on Facebook.

{"text": "Photo\n\nCairo\n\nSOMEDAY I'd love to create a journalism course based on covering the uprising in Egypt , now approaching its first anniversary. Lesson No. 1 would be the following: Whenever you see elephants flying, shut up and take notes. The Egyptian uprising is the equivalent of elephants flying. No one predicted it, and no one had seen this before. If you didn't see it coming, what makes you think you know where it's going? That's why the smartest thing now is to just shut up and take notes.\n\nIf you do, the first thing you'll write is that the Islamist parties — the Muslim Brotherhood and the Salafist Al Nour Party — just crushed the secular liberals, who actually sparked the rebellion here, in the free Egyptian parliamentary elections, winning some 65 percent of the seats. To not be worried about the theocratic, antipluralistic, anti-women's-rights, xenophobic strands in these Islamist parties is to be recklessly naïve. But to assume that the Islamists will not be impacted, or moderated, by the responsibilities of power, by the contending new power centers here and by the priority of the public for jobs and clean government is to miss the dynamism of Egyptian politics today.\n\nCome with me to Cairo's dirt-poor Shubra el-Khema neighborhood and the dilapidated Omar Abdel Aziz School, where I watched the last round of voting on Wednesday at a women-only voting center. We were guided by Amr Hassan, a 22-year-old commerce student from the 'hood — a secular youth, who fought to topple the Hosni Mubarak regime in Tahrir Square last year.\n\nHere is what was so striking: virtually all the women we interviewed after the voting — all of whom were veiled, some with only slits for their eyes — said that they had voted for either the Muslim Brotherhood or the Salafists. But almost none said they had voted that way for religious reasons.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMany said they voted for Islamists because they were neighbors, people they knew, while secular liberal candidates had never once visited. Some illiterate elderly women confided that they could not read the ballot and just voted where their kids told them to. But practically all of them said they had voted for the Muslim Brotherhood or Salafist candidates because they expected them to deliver better, more honest government — not more mosques or liquor bans.\n\nPhoto\n\nHere are some quotes from Egyptian women on why they voted Islamist: \"I love the Muslim Brotherhood; they are the only honest ones. ... I want good education and clean air to breathe. ... We need proper medical care. ... I want my kids to be properly educated. They can't find any jobs. ... The Muslim Brotherhood is not just an Islamist party. It is going to help solve all the problems of the country. ... We have to get the youth working and to raise salaries. Education here is only getting worse. ... My biggest fear is lack of security. We sit in our homes — afraid.

{"text": "The news comes on the heels of Twitter's latest quarterly report, which not only revealed that it would be laying off 350 employee, but that it was also restructuring to be profitable in 2017. And no wonder -- though it continues to make money, Twitter has never turned a profit and user growth has remained stagnant. Even after co-founder Jack Dorsey took over as CEO last year, the company just couldn't seem to turn its fortunes around.\n\n2016 in particular has been rough for Twitter. Not only did it see an exodus of executives, it also faced increasing scrutiny over its constant harassment problems. The problem reached a fever pitch this year when SNL's Leslie Jones received a barrage of racist and sexist tweets, leading her to briefly quit. Twitter did eventually ban the leader of that mob as well as implement quality filters and a safety council, but the damage was already done. Plus, those efforts don't seem to have solved matters either. Marvel writer Chelsea Cain was also recently driven off Twitter due to abusive comments she received about her work.\n\nThis turned out to be a sticking point when Twitter sought to sell itself a few months ago. Several companies were interested in the deal -- Salesforce, Google and Disney, to name a few -- but all were ultimately scared off, in part because of the toxic reputation of Twitter's users. Indeed, it seems as if Disney was even really close to pulling the trigger, but Twitter's online abuse issues proved too messy for Disney's family-friendly image.\n\nMeanwhile, Vine was fading. As mentioned earlier, it was losing valuable market share to Instagram and Snapchat. Not only do they both allow for longer clips (Instagram allows up to 60 seconds while Snapchat's restriction is 10) but there's also a lot less pressure to be funny or original. Vine was a fun place to be creative and quirky, sure, but most people just want to take goofy videos of their cat. Furthermore, the stars that did emerge on Vine quickly discovered that there weren't a lot of monetization opportunities there and eventually fled to other platforms.\n\nAt the same time, Twitter is still trying to find its voice. A few months ago, it launched an audacious television ad campaign that positioned itself as a place to \"see what's happening.\" It was the beginning of Twitter trying to rebrand as a source for live news, not just a social network. It introduced Moments, a feature that highlights trends and news tweets and further integrated Periscope, its video streaming platform. Most recently, it started dabbling into live programming, such as Thursday Night Football and the US presidential debates. It's even going to air two live original shows produced by the NBA.\n\nAs the possibility of a Twitter sale dwindled, it became clear that the company needed to double down on this vision. In a leaked internal memo, Dorsey said the site was a place for \"news and talk,\" making it \"the people's news network.\" If Twitter is going to remain independent -- which it seems like it'll have to -- it needs to focus in on a single purpose. For now, that appears to be in live news and entertainment. And unfortunately, six-second video loops have no place in this world."}

{"text": "We knew that NSA had (has) monitoring access to all Pakistani telecom operators, Pakistani Internet Service Providers and other government departments, but a new leak provides undeniable evidence that it was indeed happening.\n\nCredited to ShadowBrokers — a hacker group that previously published tools, hacks and other exploits that NSA had used to infiltrate networks and governments across the world — leaked a new dump few hours ago that has information about more ways through which NSA was accessing mobile companies, private and public networks in various countries.\n\nShadowBrokers initially had put up this data online for auction, but since no one bought it, the group shared the password of the entire dump in protest.\n\nLeaked dump, which is encrypted, is terabytes in size and security researchers have started to decrypt it already.\n\nInitial decrypted files reveal step by step guide of how NSA used to gain access to Mobilink's network. It explains the entire method on how NSA accessed servers, data and other information related to mobile phone users of Pakistan.\n\nMethod shows that NSA had access — around 2006 — to CDR (call detail record) of any Mobilink user and also that how many SIMs had been used on a single handset (to identify if the user had more than one SIMs).\n\nNSA's operators could get alerts in case a new call was made. They also had mechanism to clear any access records or logs to wipe out any traces.\n\nThis hacking method, which we believe is now patched, was made possible only after NSA hacked/exploited Solaris (Oracle's proprietary) operating system, which was otherwise considered very solid and hack-proof.\n\nAs security researchers are in process of decrypting more leaked data, it is likely that step-by-step guides of hacking other Pakistani telcos and ISPs will also be revealed.\n\nIf you are wondering if NSA will be held accountable for all the illegal stealing of data (read crimes) or if Pakistani government will protest against such naked hacks, then its not happening.\n\nExactly like the elites in Pakistan, they are free to do whatever they want to. No repercussions, completel immunity from and zero accountability.\n\nWay Forward?\n\nI have often heard from friends in government about procuring ultra-expensive systems and hardware to ensure privacy, then — if I may speak frankly — there's nothing private on the internet.\n\nNo matter how secure you get, the devices that are built (in West) are going to reveal your data to outsiders one day.\n\nThe only way forward, if possible, is to manufacture your hardware and write your code yourself to protect it. Even then you will just minimize the chances of it being getting hacked, but it won't be as easy as it seems from above incidents.\n\nIt is an open secret now that certain loopholes are left on purpose, for activities like above. It is just like you are building a house and keep a back-door for emergency entries/exits, just in case. These back-doors, are then exploited and used by agencies like NSA.\n\nUntil you don't start making hardware and software yourself, don't get bothered much about these hacks and steals."}
{"text": "I posted this soundtrack eons ago. Back when no one read my blog. Now that next to no one reads my blog, I thought I'd give it another go.\n\nThe Andromeda Strain Original Electronic Soundtrack\n\nThe Andromeda Strain is a movie that came out in 1971, based on the Michael Critchon book of the same name. It was directed by Robert Wise, who also directed such classics as West Side Story and The Day The Earth Stood Still.\n\nIt's a good adaptation of the book, albeit a little slow. What's most interesting about the film (at least in my opinion) is its groundbreaking soundtrack. The score to The Andromeda Strain is the one of the very first all-electronic scores for a major motion picture. The only one I can think of that predates it is the score to Forbidden Planet, which came out in 1956.\n\nGil Mellé composed the score, using entirely instruments of his own creation. He created many of the bizarre sounds heard on the album by recording and then distorting all kinds of found sound, including buzz saws, trains and bowling alleys. So if you think about it, that probably makes The Andromeda Strain soundtrack one of the first examples of sampling as well.\n\nIt's a very important historical document, and a technical marvel for its time, even if it hasn't aged particularly well. Its extremely experimental, often sounding more like random noise than anything that might resemble electronic music music. So if you're expecting to hear something like a John Carpenter score then you may be disappointed. It's more abstract and atonal than that, very soundscape-like. Imagine what Vangelis' studio must sound like before he tunes all his synths. It's like that.\n\nBut what's even more interesting than the score is the record that it came in.\n\nThat's right, it's a hexagon! It's so odd that it came with a warning.\n\nWell duh.\n\nEven its packaging is out of this world. The record is enclosed in a die-cut hexagon that folds out, revealing linear notes about the soundtrack, as well as pictures taken from the film.\n\nThe back cover is pretty crazy too.\n\nIt's safe to assume that this one-of-a-kind packaging and pressing cost a good amount of money to produce back in the day. I've read online that the studio only made 10,000 of these in this format, which is probably why they go for a good amount of money now. As you can tell from my pictures, my copy is more than a little beat up. If it was is better shape I would probably be able to get at least $100 for it, if not more. As it is now, I bought it for about $30.\n\nThey also released a regular, non-hexagonal version, which I also have.\n\nNot nearly as cool.\n\nAnyways, if you fancy yourself a fan of electronic music then you should definitely give this one a listen. Like I said before, it's not the most melodic thing in the world, but it's definitely worth a listen."}

{"text": "Lindsey asks: How fast do electrons flow inside electrical cables?\n\nYou may be surprised to learn that electrons flow through a typical copper wire much slower than a turtle walks.\n\nEach wire that conducts a flow of electrons, producing usable electric current, is composed of billions of atoms. To move along it, the electrons have to traverse these atoms, randomly zig-zagging their way as they do, resulting in the net flow rate, called \"drift velocity,\" in a given direction being quite slow.\n\nHow slow exactly? To calculate it, we use this formula: I = n*A*v*Q or v = I/(n*A*Q)\n\nI is the current, n is the number of electrons per cubic meter, A is the cross-section of the wire, Q is the charge of an electron and v is the drift velocity of the electrons.\n\nSince the number of electrons in a copper wire (n) is 8.5 * 1028 per m3, and the charge of an electron (Q) is 1.6 * 10-19C, if we also know the cross sectional area and the current, we can calculate the electrons' drift velocity.\n\nFor example, suppose you have a current of 14 amps and a copper wire with a cross section of 3 * 10-6 m2. Plug in all the numbers and you get that the electrons are moving at a speed of 3.4 * 10-4 m/s – or about one-third of a millimeter per second.\n\nTo put it in values that are easier to conceptualize, this works out to about 1.2 meters (4.1 feet) per hour- a rate far slower than the average box turtle, which can cover about 800 feet in that same amount of time.\n\nSo how is it that something that is essentially slower than a turtle can more or less instantaneously turn on a light across a room?\n\nChain reaction.\n\nThe atoms in the wire are crammed together cheek to jowl, which, while it makes the going slow, also has the electrons more or less abutting one another. When the switch is turned on, thanks to the electrical potential difference created by the generator, a force is created to move the electrons, with each pushing its neighbor, which in turn pushes its neighbor and so on all the way through the wire.\n\nSo, while no electrons zoom through the wire to turn on the light as you might have previously thought, it ends up seeming like that is what's happening. This is not unlike how when you turn on your faucet, water instantly comes out despite the fact that your water source might be many miles away.\n\nIf you liked this article, you might also enjoy our new popular podcast, The BrainFood Show (iTunes, Spotify, Google Play Music, Feed), as well as:\n\nBonus Fact:\n\nThe land speed record for a tortoise in competition was set by a leopard tortoise named Bertie who flew up an 18-foot uphill track in just under 20 seconds (about 0.61 mph) in 2014.\n\nExpand for References"}

{"text": "RICHMOND – Virginia Commonwealth University students receive emails from VCU Health last week reporting two confirmed cases and one suspected case of mumps on campus. Other cases have been reported in the Richmond metro area, and health officials are cautioning students and residents to take precautions.\n\nMumps is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the first signs of the mumps are usually a few days of fever, headaches, muscle aches, tiredness and loss of appetite, followed by swelling of the salivary glands. The disease is preventable by the mumps, measles and rubella vaccine, which most children receive before age 4.\n\nVCU hasn't been the only target of the mumps these past weeks. Multiple universities have reported cases to the CDC as well:\n\n· U.S. News and World Report reported Monday that Kansas State reached 15 cases of mumps since February.\n\n· WTOP reported Wednesday that George Washington University confirmed two cases of mumps there.\n\n· At Louisiana State University confirmed 20 cases as reported by WAFB on March 28.\n\n· The Seattle Times reported that the University of Washington found 20 cases of mumps that were concentrated in the university's Greek system\n\n· Chapman University in California found three cases as of April 6, according to the local Fox station.\n\n· Western Illinois University, Appalachian State University and others are all on also the list of universities that have broken out in cases of the mumps in the past few weeks.\n\nIt is unclear whether the VCU students or students at other universities received the MMR vaccine. However, even with the vaccination, prevention of the virus is not guaranteed. One dose of the vaccine is about 78 percent effect and two doses roughly 88 percent effective.\n\nThis is not the first time the mumps have hit campuses across the states. According to the CDC, there were similar outbreaks throughout many universities in 2011-2013, 2014 and 2015-2016. One outbreak even went as far as affecting the National Hockey League.\n\nDr. Melissa Viray, deputy director for the Richmond City Health District, said that so far, there is no correlation between the outbreaks and university campuses. But one explanation is that mumps spreads easily when people are in close contact with each other, such as attending the same class or living in the same dormitory.\n\nViray said another reason is that people aren't as concerned as they used to be about diseases like mumps.\n\n\"I think what we are seeing overall, not just in mumps but other preventable diseases, is that people are less afraid of diseases like measles, mumps and polio that they don't push getting a vaccine as much,\" Viray said. \"They may not vaccinate their kids on the advised schedule, and it puts their children at risk.\"\n\nThe CDC recommend two doses of the MMR vaccine received at a young age. Even if students have received the MMR vaccinations, students should take extra precautions to avoid the mumps. Wash hands regularly, do not share food or drink and stay home if sick.\n\nWords By Mary Lee Clark via VCU Capital News Service"}
{"text": "By now, the story of Joy Karega is familiar to many. An assistant professor at Oberlin College and strident proponent of boycotting Israel on campus, Karega moonlighted as an unhinged anti-Semite on social media. On her Facebook page, she labeled ISIS a \"CIA and Mossad operation,\" claimed Israel downed Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, said the Mossad perpetrated the Charlie Hebdo attacks, posted a video arguing that Jews perpetrated 9/11, and shared an anti-Semitic meme of Jewish banker Jacob Rothschild that proclaimed \"We own your news, the media, your oil, and your government.\"\n\nAfter the exposure of Karega's hateful propagandizing was met with a muted response from the university–its president defended Karega's academic freedom, yet did not exercise his own to condemn her statements–Oberlin's board of trustees was forced to step in and condemn the postings as \"anti-Semitic and abhorrent.\" It called for a full investigation into Karega.\n\nAmidst all this controversy about Karega's lurid anti-Semitic outbursts, however, a much wider and more troubling failure by Oberlin has been overlooked. Because the truth is, the scandal at the prestigious school is much bigger than one professor's anti-Semitism.\n\nAs the New York Times reported, Karega, a professor of rhetoric and composition, teaches \"social justice writing courses.\" According to Oberlin's course catalog, one such class is \"RHET 204 – Writing for Social Justice.\" In it, \"Students will develop, negotiate, and revise their own writing strategies and ethics as they write on social justice issues relevant to their interests.\"\n\nIn other words, Oberlin hired an unrepentant bigot to teach undergraduates to write about justice and guide them in their moral development.\n\nThis astounding fact suggests that the entire hiring process for social justice-related fields at Oberlin is fundamentally broken and easily gamed. After all, it's difficult to imagine a greater or more systemic failure than Karega being chosen to teach students how to communicate about moral causes.\n\nSeen in this light, the debate over whether Oberlin should discipline or fire Karega is a distraction from an even more serious reckoning. Because whether Karega herself leaves or stays on, Oberlin must account for itself far beyond one individual professor. It must ask how its hiring committees missed the signs that they were contracting a bigot to teach ethics. What questions did they fail to pose during the interview process? What areas of the applicant's background and past work did they fail to investigate? Did any members of the faculty who chose Karega share her prejudices and thus allow them to slide? If Karega could slip by, who else might have?\n\nOn the other hand, if the school merely scapegoats Karega while letting off those who enabled her to come in contact with undergraduates in the first place, Oberlin will have demonstrated that it is not interested in addressing its prejudice problem, but rather suppressing its symptoms.\n\nPrevious: Oberlin Students Receive Anti-Semitic Email from Self-Proclaimed 'Truthseeker'\n\nYair Rosenberg is a senior writer at Tablet.

{"text": "Today has brought us tracklists for two anticipated upcoming rap albums, and they couldn't be more different. Kendrick Lamar's DAMN. features only two guests—Rihanna and U2—who, aside from whatever they contribute musically, function as enviable status symbols. Logic's Everybody, meanwhile, sports a deep, bizarre, and intriguing cast of characters—and that's only the beginning.\n\nRappers often seem to operate with a pack mentality when it comes to collaborations. There's always a certain group of artists it feels like show up on more rap albums than not in a given time period. Recently, that group has included Future, Young Thug, Migos, 2 Chainz, Ty Dolla $ign, etc. There's nothing wrong with this, exactly—all of those artists are great, and placing any of them in a new context allows us to hear them in a way we might not otherwise, as Drake did in coaxing a uniquely personal verse out of Young Thug on More Life's \"Sacrifices.\" But it also means that the ever dwindling supply of actual rap \"albums\" can feel interchangeable, a trend that mirrors the industry's consolidation as a whole.\n\nThe new album by Logic, a 27-year-old rapper from Maryland, will not have that problem. Everybody, his third official release on Def Jam, looks like this:\n\nWhat an objectively incredible collection of words! Killer Mike, Black Thought, Chuck D, Juicy J. A song called \"Black SpiderMan\" featuring Broadway actor Damian Lemar Hudson. \"AfricAryaN\" featuring Neil deGrasse Tyson. A song featuring Ansel Elgort and a song title that is just the National Suicide Prevention Hotline. Could those last two be related?\n\nStill, this is only scratching the surface. As you can see at the top of the image, Everybody is billed as \"starring\" the celebrity astrophysicist Tyson and BIGVON, a longtime DJ and radio personality on 106 KMEL, the premier rap station in the Bay Area. Logic's image doesn't state what exactly \"starring\" means, but retweeted something that, well…\n\nIn an interview explaining the album with the site Hard Knock TV, Logic explains that the album was inspired by the novel The Martian, which is about an astronaut stranded on Mars who has to improvise his way back to Earth. (You may have seen the movie starring Matt Damon.) Logic says that he contacted the book's author, Andy Weir, to get his permission to loosely base his album around the book, to which Weir said yes. \"I had the idea to do the skits,\" Logic says of the album's structure. \"But then it hit me: What if I actually rapped from the perspective of all the lives this guy is living?\" A great question indeed.\n\nIn the interview, Logic talks at length about how he doesn't think anyone should draw lines around his music, and, you know, as someone who is not a fan of his music, I agree. More albums with Ansel Elgort and Killer Mike on back-to-back songs. At least from this one guy."}

They formed to show the world that Witch Elves were an honourable race after the entire Witch Elf cheerleading section of the Darkside Cowboys stole their teams treasury with the aide of Nikk Three-Horn. This act brought great shame to the Witch Elves and priestesses of Naggaroth so they created a team to show The World what they were made of. The team was called the Deadly Nightshades and great success followed.\n\n\nDespite their success on the field the team was short lived as regular Dark Elf teams began to hire Witch Elves in their teams. Though their impact was never forgotten and even today Witch Elf teams can still be found playing in tribute to the great Deadly Nightshades.\n\n\nRationale\n\n\nThe Witch Elf team was solely based on The Deadly Nightshades background. The team is an all Witch Elf team. Being an all Witch Elf team it was obvious that the only positional in the team should be a Witch Elf after that came choosing a Lineman.\n\n\nI went for a Pro Elf stat line for the linemen as it would not make sense having better armoured Linemen than the positional. Ma7 was considered but because Priestesses are basically Witch Elves in training it felt more appropriate to give them lower Ma as they are not in as good physical condition as the Witch Elves.\n\n\nI went with 0-8 Witch Elves as it is a Witch Elf team after all and I also felt that having any more than 5 or possibly 6 in the roster could actually be detrimental to the team though I didn't want to limit the teams options too much and if a coach wants to play an all out crazed Witch Elf team they should be allowed to.\n\n\nSeason 2 Changes\n\n200 games played, with a win percentage of 48% which is a bit lower than expected. Although they have a relatively small number of games played so far. I expect them to be comfortably in the tier 1 range as they perform pretty well in the right hands. No change needed based on play testing and the numbers so far.\n\n\nTeam design, background and rationale by Garion\n\nIcons by Whatball and Garion\n\nPlayer artwork by Knut Rockie and coloured by Garion\n\n\nLast update: February 24, 2018"}

She has accepted donations from Wall Street donors, and Sanders has not.\n\nBut at the Democratic debate in Charleston Sunday night, Clinton unearthed a part of Sanders' record on Wall Street regulations that seems -- at least at the outset -- to complicate his claim of being a crusader for more, rather than less regulation.\n\nSpecifically, she noted that Sanders voted in favor of The Commodity Futures Modernization Act in 2000.\n\n\"Well, the last point on this is, Senator Sanders, you're the only one on this stage that voted to deregulate the financial market in 2000, to take the cops off the street, to use Governor O'Malley's phrase, to make the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission no longer able to regulate swaps and derivatives, which were one of the main cause of the collapse in '08,\" Clinton said.\n\nAnd she's right. But here's what she didn't say: Not only did President Bill Clinton sign that bill into law, but key officials in his administration were also credited with helping to craft it.\n\nThe Sunlight Foundation, as part of their \"Read the Bill\" effort to demystify the legislative process explained it this way:\n\nLeading the charge in Congress were Sens. Phil Gramm (R-TX) and Richard Lugar (R-IN) and Rep. Thomas Ewing (R-IL). In May of 2000, Rep. Ewing introduced his Commodity Futures Modernization Act. While Ewing's bill sailed quickly through the House, it stalled in the Senate, as Sen. Gramm desired stricter deregulatory language be inserted into the bill. Gramm opposed any language that could provide the SEC or the CFTC with any hope of authority in regulating or oversight of financial derivatives and swaps. Gramm's opposition held the bill in limbo until Congress went into recess for the 2000 election. Throughout the better part of the year Gramm, Lugar and Ewing worked with the President's Working Group on Financial Markets—most specifically, Treasury Secretary [Larry] Summers, CFTC Chairman [William[ Rainer and SEC Chairman [Arthur] Levitt—to strike a deal on the bill.\n\nThe final version of the bill included stronger deregulatory language, but it isn't clear whether many lawmakers knew that it was in there. (This was around the time that the country was embroiled in a contentious presidential vote recount in Florida.)\n\nThe CFMA made its way through Congress on the back of a must-pass, 11,000-page bill to fund the government that year. This is where Sanders comes in, he joined a majority of Democrats and Republicans in approving the omnibus bill, which was signed into law by Bill Clinton.\n\nBill Clinton has since said that he regrets that decision."}

{"text": "More than 500 years after Christopher Columbus set foot on the shores of the New World, what may be the first-ever depiction of the native Americans he encountered has been discovered hidden in a Vatican painting.\n\nThe discovery was made by restoration experts who were cleaning a large fresco painted by the Renaissance master Pinturicchio. Once they had removed layers of dirt, they noticed a group of tiny figures, almost in the middle of the painting.\n\nThe figures are men who seem to be dancing and are naked except for exotic-looking feather headdresses. One appears to have a Mohican-style haircut.\n\nPinturicchio created the work, which shows Jesus' Resurrection, in 1494, just a year after Columbus returned from his first journey of discovery across the Atlantic.\n\nThe head of the Vatican Museums, Antonio Paolucci, believes that the mysterious figures represent some of the native Americans whom the Genoese explorer met as he sailed around the Caribbean.\n\nProfessor Paolucci announced the discovery of the long-lost image in the Vatican's daily newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano, in an article titled \"This is the first image of native Americans as described by Columbus.\" He hypothesized that the \"nude men, who are decorated with feathers and seem to be dancing,\" were inspired by the descriptions of tribesmen that Columbus brought back from his travels.\n\nThe Pinturicchio painting, titled simply \"Resurrection,\" has adorned the walls of the Borgia Apartments in the Vatican for centuries.\n\nThe apartments were named after the notorious Rodrigo Borgia, who became Pope Alexander VI. He commissioned Pinturicchio and his assistants to paint several frescoes for the apartments, which are part of the Vatican's Apostolic Palace.\n\nThe tiny dancing figures remained unnoticed for so long because the Borgia Apartments were abandoned after the death of Pope Alexander in 1503. Subsequent popes did not want to be associated with the scandal-ridden family. They were only reopened in 1889 by Pope Leo XIII, and are now used to display a collection of religious art.\n\nColumbus's voyages across the Atlantic were commissioned by Spain, but Paolucci said the Vatican knew of his discoveries, particularly given that Pope Alexander was Spanish.\n\n\"The Borgia Pope was interested in the New World, as were the great chancelleries of Europe. It is hard to believe that the papal court, especially under a Spanish Pope, would have remained in the dark about what Columbus encountered,\" Paolucci said in the article.\n\nPope Alexander soon found himself playing a pivotal role in the New World discoveries – he had to arbitrate between the competing claims of Spain and Portugal.\n\nFollow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.\n\nThe pope had himself painted into the lavish fresco – dressed in sumptuous golden robes, he is kneeling down on the left side, his hands clasped in prayer.\n\nHe is clearly contemplating Jesus' resurrection, but he also appears to be directing his gaze at the tribesmen – ruminating, perhaps, on the enormous implications of Columbus's historic discovery."}
{"text": "The atmosphere of Mars is less than 1 percent the density of Earth's. It's one of the reasons liquid water covers much of our planet but cannot exist on the Red Planet. As more research points toward the possibility of water on early Mars, scientists have increased their studies on the density of its atmosphere billions of years ago. It's not an easy task. In fact, it's very difficult to even determine Earth's atmospheric pressure from the same time frame.\n\nGeorgia Tech Assistant Professor Josef Dufek is attempting to learn more about the past atmospheric conditions by analyzing two unlikely sources: ancient volcanic eruptions and surface observations by the Mars rover Spirit. His new findings, published by the journal Geophysical Research Letters, provide more evidence that early Mars was saturated with water and that its atmosphere was considerably thicker, at least 20 times more dense, than it is today.\n\n\"Atmospheric pressure has likely played a role in developing almost all Mars' surface features,\" said Dufek, an instructor in the School Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. \"The planet's climate, the physical state of water on its surface and the potential for life are all influenced by atmospheric conditions.\"\n\nDufek's first research tool was a rock fragment propelled into the Martian atmosphere during a volcanic eruption roughly 3.5 billion years ago. The deposit landed in the volcanic sediment, created a divot (or bomb sag), eventually solidified and remains in the same location today. Dufek's next tool was the Mars rover. In 2007, Spirit landed at that site, known as Home Plate, and took a closer look at the imbedded fragment. Dufek and his collaborators at the University of California-Berkeley received enough data to determine the size, depth and shape of the bomb sag.\n\nDufek and his team then went to the lab to create bomb sags of their own. They created beds of sand using grains the same size as those observed by Spirit. The team propelled particles of varying materials (glass, rock and steel) at different speeds into dry, damp and saturated sand beds before comparing the divots with the bomb sag on Mars. No matter the type of particle, the saturated beds consistently produced impact craters similar in shape to the Martian bomb sag.\n\nBy varying the propulsion speeds, Dufek's team also determined that the lab particles must hit the sand at a speed of less than 40 meters per second to create similar penetration depths. In order for something to move through Mars' atmosphere at that peak velocity, the pressure would have to be a minimum of 20 times more dense than current conditions, which suggests that early Mars must have had a thicker atmosphere. Click here for a video demonstration.\n\n\"Our study is consistent with growing research that early Mars was at least a transiently watery world with a much denser atmosphere than we see today,\" said Dufek. \"We were only able to study one bomb sag at one location on the Red Planet. We hope to do future tests on other samples based on observations by the next rover, Curiosity.\"\n\nCuriosity is scheduled to land on Mars on August 5. The material is based upon work supported by NASA under award No NNX09AL20G."}

The actor—who just published the book Manhood: How to Be A Better Man - Or Just Live With One—recently took part in the What Makes A Man 2014: Maps to Manhood conference and sat down with Elamin Abdelmahmoud to discuss feminism, consent and what it means to \"be a man\" today.\n\nThe entire talk is well worth a listen, but here are some particularly choice excerpts.\n\nOn feminism:\n\nI think the big thing about feminism is that it scares men because, you know—the big deal is that people are scared of being controlled...I want to be clear that feminism is not saying \"women are better than men.\" That's not what's going on...What it is is that we're talking about gender equality, true gender equality...but the problem is that men have always felt like they're more valuable...I have been that guy where I felt I was more valuable than my wife and kids.\n\nOn being outspoken about the problems with modern day masculinity:\n\nI get a lot of guys who are like, \"You know, that's good, man. That's cool,\" and I also get guys who are like, \"What are you DOING?\"...It's like, what is the big deal? But it's [that I'm] telling. [I'm] telling. \"It's MAN CODE, dude. Man Code!

In fact, she don't even want to be with me, but I don't care. I'm going to take it.\" What kind of mindset is that? Never never never never never should that ever be accepted. That's not \"code.\" That's Taliban. That's ISIS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the importance of men supporting the feminist cause:\n\nI kind of relate it to slavery. Or even civil rights. Let's not even go back to slavery, let's go to civil rights—the people who were silent at the lunch counters, when it was the black lunch counter and the white one or the schools were segregated...and you were quiet.

{"text": "Guyana and Norway yesterday hailed a historic agreement that will see the Scandinavian country invest $250m (£150m) to preserve the rainforests of the Latin America nation. With world leaders warning that no legally binding agreement will be possible at the climate summit in Copenhagen next month, the two comparative minnows completed one of the biggest forest conservation deals ever signed.\n\nBoth sides signalled their intention to \"provide the world with a working example of how partnerships between developed and developing countries can save the world's tropical forests,\" they said in a joint statement.\n\nThe former British colony, sandwiched between Venezuela and Brazil, is home to fewer than a million people but it also boasts an intact rainforest larger than England. In 2007 Guyana's president Bharrat Jagdeo made an unprecedented offer to to place its entire standing forest under the control of a British-led international body in return for a bilateral deal with the UK to secure development aid and the technical assistance needed to switch to a low carbon economy.\n\nDespite a number of false starts and assurances that it was considering the offer – first publicised in The Independent – Downing Street failed to make any concrete progress, leaving the way clear for oil-rich Norway to seize the opportunity.\n\nSpeaking yesterday during a visit to London, President Jagdeo said that public pressure was vital on rich, polluting countries to \"help progressive politicians to deliver results on climate change\". While avoiding criticism of the UK government, the Guyanese leader thanked those who had brought the country's rainforest offer into the international arena.\n\n\"The Independent was key to getting our original message to the public, and this kind of campaigning journalism will be vital in the years to come,\" he said.\n\nCountries like Guyana, whose capital Georgetown is extremely vulnerable to rising sea levels, have contributed next to nothing to the heat- trapping gases in the atmosphere that cause global warming. Yet they will be among the first victims of a changed climate and have been seeking ways to preserve the vast carbon sinks of their tropical forest without sacrifcing development in a country where many live in abject poverty.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement with Norway, Guyana will accelerate its efforts to limit forest-based greenhouse gas emissions and protect its rainforest as an asset for the world. Norway will provide financial support of up to $250m over five years in line with the Jagdeo administration's success in implementing limiting emissions and halting deforestation.\n\n\"Through this partnership, we are building a bridge between developed and developing countries,\" said Norway's Minister of the Environment and International Development Erik Solheim. \"We are giving the world a workable model for climate change collaboration between North and South. It's not perfect, but it's good, and it will be improved upon as we learn and develop together.\"\n\nThe accelerating destruction of the rainforests that form a cooling band around the earth's equator is recognised as one the main causes of climate change.\n\nTropical deforestation accounts for one-fifth of all carbon emissions, more than the entire transport sector – including the aviation industry. The landmark Stern Review concluded that forests offer the single largest chance for cost-effective and immediate reductions of carbon emissions."}
{"text": "Most Municipal Police Departments In State Not Accredited\n\nBut many starting to seek the credentials\n\nChief Carl Sferrazza has used it as a template for 18 years to maintain the Enfield Police Department's standing as one of the most effective and cutting-edge agencies in the region.\n\nChief Jack Drumm used accreditation – the law-enforcement version of that badge of competence so crucial to schools and hospitals – to help pull the scandal-laden Madison police department out of the rubble.\n\nDifferent chiefs. Different reasons. Same idea: Use the accreditation process -- that quest every three years to pass muster in the eyes of unforgiving outside evaluators – to initially force feed nationally tested standards to the police officers, and then watch the approach, over time, become ingrained in the department.\n\nFrom high-speed pursuits, use of force, and preserving evidence, to racial profiling, handling prisoners and dealing with immigrants – cops who work for accredited departments can avoid the pitfalls of a backward agency – that dusting off of the outdated policy manual when there's a crisis, or learning upon moving to another shift that the new crew \"does things their way.\"\n\nBut the list of accredited police departments in Connecticut is shorter than the public may think, despite the obvious benefits. Some chiefs say the accreditation process would strain department resources.\n\nOnly 29 of the 104 municipal, state, university and tribal police departments in Connecticut are accredited. That number represents all of the agencies with the exclusive, more costly national credential, or the state's version, which is free, offered in phases, and is relatively easier to attain. About half of the agencies have both designations.\n\nBut the percentage of credentialed agencies here is too low given the pace of reform nationally, and the serious missteps of some Connecticut police departments that have led to federal indictments, firings, or costly discipline, say state criminal-justice officials, police trainers, and police chiefs.\n\n\"I'd like to see more,'' said Harold T. \"Ted\" Lemay, the former Avon police lieutenant who has run the state's accreditation program at the Police Officers Standards and Training Council in Meriden for the last seven years.\n\n\"As a citizen, I'd like to see every department accredited,'' said Wethersfield Police Chief James Cetran, whose agency holds both the state and national credentials. \"The department tends to be more professional and you know where you stand because you're standards have been tested against national practices.''\n\nMichael Lawlor, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy's criminal-justice adviser, said there's a clear trend among agencies nationally to adopt the newest and best procedures.\n\n\"And accreditation validates that,'' said Lawlor, adding that there have been early discussions in Connecticut about mandating some level of accreditation or tying it to grants or other funding.\n\n\"More and more leaders are recognizing the consequences of not keeping pace,'' said Lawlor, a former state representative in East Haven and former state prosecutor. \"The East Haven Police Department is a case in point, but there are others. You expose yourself to multi-million dollar lawsuits, or Department of Justice investigations, or both.''"}
{"text": "The National Park Service and the Coast Guard say they will hire contractors for positions typically filled by civilian employees, something a federal union says is illegal.\n\nBoth agencies say they are within their legal rights. Under federal law, agencies are prohibited from contracting out certain functions performed by civilian employees.\n\nNPS and the Coast Guard maintain that the positions they seek to fill constitute new work and do not affect existing employees. The American Federation of Government Employees, which represents the civilian workforce at both agencies, called the plans \"illegal outsourcing\" of jobs that have been \"designated for performance by federal employees.\" AFGE called on the Office of Management and Budget to weigh in on the debate and to issue governmentwide guidance clarifying agencies' responsibility to keep jobs in house.\n\nThe Coast Guard wants contractors to collect new user fees at its National Vessel Documentation Center in Falling Waters, W.Va. The subagency is largely fee funded, and due to a recent drop off in business it will soon add a new annual renewal user fee. The Coast Guard said it cannot use federal employees, who have historically collected all user fees, because of the Anti-Deficiency Act, which prohibits agencies from spending more money than they have been authorized to spend by Congress. It also stressed no current federal employees will lose their jobs because of the contract.\n\nAFGE disagrees with that assessment.\n\n\"An annual renewal user fee is just another user fee, not new work,\" the union's National President J. David Cox wrote in a letter to OMB. He added, \"Why would the NVDC be able to spend money to pay contractors but not federal employees, whether permanent or temporary, to perform the same function?\"\n\nNPS also argued it could not afford new federal employees. The agency plans to contract out custodial and grounds-keeping work at the Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, Pa. In a letter to Rep. Bob Brady, D-Pa., who first contacted the agency about the positions, NPS said the contract will not impact any current employees and would give it \"budgetary and operational flexibility.\"\n\n\"Our position is no federal employee lost their job because of the contract,\" said Jane Cowley, an NPS spokeswoman.\n\nIn a second letter to OMB, AFGE's Cox asked the Obama administration to ensure all custodial and grounds-keeping contracts that are \"inconsistent with the law\" are cancelled and the work is brought back in house. He added the NPS policy was an insult to AFGE itself.\n\n\"I consider NPS' sourcing and workforce management policies to be not just inconsistent with the law, not just anti-taxpayer, and not just anti-federal employee, but also profoundly anti-union,\" Cox wrote.\n\nAFGE said the agencies did not provide the previously required cost-benefit analyses to back up the contracts, and the use of such a process is no longer legal in the cases anyway.\n\nCORRECTION: This story previously said functions performed by fewer than 10 civilian employees were exempt from requirements to keep jobs in house. While the relevant section in U.S. Code still provides for such an exception for non-Defense positions, a 2009 appropriations act struck the clause."}

Denzil Minnan-Wong and Coun. Shelley Carroll appeared Tuesday on CBC Radio's Metro Morning, one day after Justice Charles T. Hackland ruled that Ford's council seat be vacated for violating the city's conflict of interest rules.\n\nBoth councillors were disappointed at comments Ford made following the ruling. On Monday, Ford told a crowd of reporters gathered outside his office that the decision to remove him was the result of \"left-wing politics.\"\n\n\"I think it's an unfair characterization to say the judge has a certain political agenda,\" said Minnan-Wong. \"I think that's false and not entirely appropriate.\"\n\nCarroll agreed.\n\n\"This is a man who has come through this consequence and his comment is still: 'I'm not going to let people — and by people he means a court of law — tell me what I can and cannot do.'\"\n\nCarroll said the judge's decision will hurt Ford politically. Minnan-Wong agreed but said a core base of Ford's support will likely remain.\n\n\"This has hurt him, but there is still a substantial constituency out there who believes that he's a victim and that still support his agenda,\" said Minnan-Wong. \"He has a pretty strong core, the real question is will he maintain that core if his intention is to run in 2014?\"\n\nCity faces key issues in coming weeks\n\nBoth Minnan-Wong and Carroll said Monday's ruling will force every member of council to work harder and overcome an impression among many voters that the city has devolved into a partisan circus unable to deal with the business of governing Canada's largest city.\n\nBoth said the city faces key issues in the coming weeks. A council meeting likely to span three days got underway Tuesday morning and the often gruelling budget process will begin later in the week.\n\n\"We have to redouble our focus on the business of the city,\" said Minnan-Wong. \"We, as a council, continue on. We have ... some really important issues coming up today.\"\n\nCarroll said councillors have to prove they can rise to the challenge in the wake of the Ford decision.\n\n\"I'm hoping that the sombre tone yesterday is an indication that people realize that this is serious and we've got to demonstrate that in this uncertainty, council can take hold,\" said Carroll.\n\nAs for the question of who will wind up sitting in the mayor's chair, both councillors told host Matt Galloway that they must allow the appeal process to unfold.\n\nMinnan-Wong said the timing of any appeal Ford may file will likely determine whether or not the city should hold a byelection, should Ford not be restored as mayor after the appeal process is exhausted.\n\n\"It really depends on how much time is left in the mandate,\" said Minnan-Wong. \"If there's a significant time left in the mandate, the pressure increases to serve democracy and go to the people.\""}
{"text": "OTTAWA — A top organizer for both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is actively working with the NDP — and predicts Canadians will conclude that Leader Tom Mulcair is the only person who can defeat Stephen Harper. Jeremy Bird was President Obama's national field director in 2012, helping to identify and motivate individual voters at the grassroots level. More recently, he was one of the figures inside the political action committee promoting Clinton as a presidential candidate. He's now well acquainted with Canadian politics, and speaks with ease about regional support levels, vote splits and party records. \"A lot of what you see from the Conservative policies of the Harper government are a lot like the rhetoric we're hearing from the Republican Party primaries — economic policies to help the rich get richer at the expense of the middle class, a budget that's only balanced on the back of working class families ... denials of climate change,\" Bird said in an interview from Washington, D.C. \"Fortunately we share democratic values with the NDP, and I think climate change is just one example of that.\" Bird spoke to NDP party members at a 2013 NDP convention, and in the intervening years his Chicago-based firm 270 Strategies has advised the party on improving their contact with potential voters. Bird, who has come up to Canada a few times since the election began, discounts Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau as a credible threat to Harper's hold on power. \"It's a riding by riding election in which the candidates have to make their case at the riding level,\" said Bird. \"Their strength in Quebec gives them a massive advantage in terms of being the real alternative that can put together enough seats to form government that is not led by Stephen Harper.\" The Obama for America campaign became legendary for being able to use data to identify supporters and also other voters who might be persuadable. Digital messages and those delivered in person were tailored to the specific individual — called micro-targeting. Armies of volunteers fanned out across districts to make sure ballots were cast. But the Conservative Party is good at that sort of campaign too. They've had success at stitching together the right numbers of voters in particular ridings with the right messages, using a well-fed party database. Bird dismisses this Conservative prowess, saying the tactics are ineffective if the party's record falls flat with voters. His firm has been helping the New Democrats learn how to pinpoint battleground ridings, and then harness the energy of local volunteers and organizers — including offering them training. Ensuring that a voter's online interactions with the party are meaningful is also key, said Bird. \"What it's really going to come down to is operations on the ground, neighbours talking to neighbours, people talking to people in their riding.\" The Conservatives made headlines earlier this month when it was revealed they had been using the services of Australian campaign consultant Lynton Crosby, credited with helping secure victories for John Howard as well as for British Prime Minister David Cameron. \"The election in Canada is going to be won based on the strength of the three leaders and their ability to appeal to the majority of Canadians and the strength of their party,\" said Bird. \"It's not going to be decided based on any outside consultants, whether they be from Australia, England, the United States, etc.\"\n\nLike Us On Facebook\n\n\nAlso on HuffPost"}
{"text": "Associated Press\n\nEvery so often in Formula One, a team comes up with a completely revolutionary design which gives them a massive advantage over the competition.\n\nIn 2009, Brawn GP developed a double diffuser which significantly increased downforce and allowed Jenson Button to win six of the first seven races before other teams started to catch up. The lead he built in the championship was so large that although Button did not win again that season, he was able to take the Drivers' title.\n\nThis year, turbocharged engines have returned to F1, and Mercedes has come up with an innovative design that has given the team (and to a lesser extent, its engine customers) a significant advantage on the track.\n\nThe innovation is that the two parts of the turbocharger, the turbine and the compressor, are split rather than packaged together, as per usual. Sky Sports' Martin Brundle explains it well in this video:\n\nIn hindsight, this trick seems relatively simple, although it is obviously not—otherwise Mercedes would not be the only manufacturer to come up with it.\n\nIn Motor Sport Magazine (via Sky Sports) Mark Hughes detailed the numerous advantages of this turbocharger design, including less turbo lag, more power available from the Energy Recovery Systems and greater fuel efficiency.\n\nHe also notes ancillary benefits such as smaller sidepods—meaning improved aerodynamic efficiency, since the air going from the turbocharger to the engine does not require as much cooling—as well as a better centre of gravity for the car.\n\nI wrote before the season that teams designing their own engines and chassis would have a significant advantage this season. While that has not been the case for Ferrari, it certainly has for Mercedes.\n\nForce India, Williams and McLaren all have the same Mercedes power unit, and all have improved significantly relative to last season. However, they had access to the power units much later than the Mercedes design team and so were not able to find all the same aerodynamic advantages that the Silver Arrows have.\n\nMark Thompson/Getty Images\n\nThe biggest advantage for Mercedes, though, might be the engine homologation rules. From February 28, engine development has been frozen, aside from fixing reliability issues or generating cost savings (and then only with the approval of the FIA).\n\nThis means that Renault and Ferrari will be unable to copy the Mercedes design until next season.\n\nWhile some fans may be worried that Mercedes' running away with the championship will be as uninteresting as Sebastian Vettel's winning streak at the end of last season, the 1988 season is probably a much better comparison.\n\nThat year, McLaren had the best car by far—the MP4/4 won 15 of 16 races—but the championship battle was anything but boring. Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost duelled back and forth and the Drivers' title was not decided until the second-to-last race of the season.\n\nWith any luck, we will see a similar tilt between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg this year—even if Mercedes does have the Constructors' Championship wrapped up by the summer break.\n\nFollow Matthew Walthert on Twitter:\n\nFollow @MatthewWalthert"}

{"text": "Please enable Javascript to watch this video\n\nMADISON (WITI) -- It has been one year since Colorado and Washington legalized marijuana, and this year, half of the states will consider similar legislation. A Democratic Wisconsin representative has introduced a bill into the state Assembly to legalize marijuana.\n\nThe bill has attracted six Democratic co-sponsors.\n\nLRB 3671 would legalize marijuana for recreational and medicinal purposes in Wisconsin.\n\nRep. Melissa Sargent says the bill is a good start to bringing a policy we've seen implemented in Colorado and Washington State to Wisconsin.\n\n\"After researching this issue extensively, I believe that this bill will benefit Wisconsin and its citizens in many ways, including: addressing racial disparities in arrests, providing medical benefits, time and cost savings to law enforcement, and additional revenue for the state,\" Rep. Sargent stated in a press release posted on her website.\n\n\"It just makes sense,\" Gary Storck told FOX6 News.\n\nStorck is one of Wisconsin's leading advocates for decriminalizing marijuana. As a glaucoma patient, he learned in the 1970s that smoking cannabis reduced his inter-ocular eye pressure and helped to save his vision.\n\n\"It has helped me. I've been using cannabis every day since then, that I've been able to access it,\" Storck said.\n\nStorck founded the group \"Is My Medicine Legal Yet?\" or IMMLY.\n\nMedical marijuana is already legal in 20 states, and 14 others are considering medical marijuana laws this year.\n\nAs for Wisconsin...\n\n\"I don't think you're going to see anything serious anytime soon here, but if other states did, maybe in the next Legislative session there'd be more talk about it,\" Gov. Walker said.\n\nGov. Walker spoke with Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper at last week's National Governor's Assocation meeting, where Hickenlooper said his state would see $134 million in sales tax revenue for the year -- much higher than expected.\n\n\"He talked about the upsides of the revenue. He also talked about how they weren't rushing to spend that on other things because, he said, it's early and they're still concerned about the side effects,\" Gov. Walker said.\n\nDespite the fact that Rep. Sargent has introduced LRB 3671, the consensus among state law enforcement officials seems to be that marijuana is a \"gateway drug,\" and should remain illegal.\n\nGov. Walker agrees, but says he isn't completely shutting the door on this issue.\n\n\"It may be something that resonates in the future, but I just don't see any movement for it right now,\" Gov. Walker said.\n\nThat means for now, folks like Gary Storck must weigh criminal penalties against crippling pain.\n\n\"I have to buy it on the black market, like so many patients, and it's really sad because people want this medicine, they want legal access, but because our lawmakers haven't yet caught up with public opinion, they still have to break the law,\" Storck said.\n\nWhat do you think? Is Wisconsin ready for the legalization of marijuana?"}
{"text": "New mother Kelly Barnes is heartbroken and angry.\n\nShe's heartbroken because she has endured what no mother should have to endure. While pregnant with twins, she lost one of them at 30 weeks. The other baby, Kinsleigh, was born with serious heart problems.\n\nBut Barnes is angry because her insurance company, Aetna, held up paying thousands of dollars in medical charges. The reason? The insurance company said the newborn might have been suffering from a pre-existing condition.\n\n\"I don't know how something could be pre-existing in a baby, so it was very shocking to me to see something like that,\" Barnes told \"Good Morning America.\" \"It's a slap in the face. Her medical bills are the last thing I should be worrying about. I should know that my baby is being taken care of.\"\n\n\"Under Aetna's own definition, in order to deny for pre-existing condition, there has to be medical advice or care that was rendered or given,\" Barnes' attorney, Tom Caldwell, said. \"And in this case, of course, that would be real hard, given the fact the baby was still in the womb.\"\n\nBarnes said she called Aetna hoping for a resolution.\n\n\"It's like you're talking to somebody who is reading from a script,\" Barnes said. \"They don't have answers for you based on what you're telling them.\"\n\nFinally, Barnes contacted \"GMA.\" We called the insurance company in September and they claim that the pre-existing condition hold up was a simple coding error and have been paying back Barnes' claims since July. But Barnes said that no one ever told her that and it wasn't until \"GMA\" got involved that all the costs were finally paid this week.\n\n\"It is my personal belief that they will -- they do this to you, expecting you not to follow up with it,\" she said. \"And I'm sure most people don't.\"\n\nConsumer expert Deann Friedholm said what Barnes experienced is not uncommon.\n\n\"It really might be a clerical error, but let's face it, it is in the company's interest to not pay bills. The fewer bills they pay, the better their bottom line is,\" Friedholm said.\n\nKinsleigh still needs heart operations, but those Aetna said they'll be paying for. Even so, Barnes said she'll never forget the nightmare that Aetna put her and her family through.\n\nFollowing the \"GMA\" investigation, Aetna apologized to Barnes.\n\nCLICK HERE to read Aetna's response to our story.\n\nTips for the Insured\n\nThe following tips were provided by Deborah Senn, former Insurance Commissioner for the State of Washington and author of an upcoming book called \"Survival Insurance.\"\n\nLook at your Explanation of Benefits form very carefully.\n\nQuestion everything and if it doesn't look right, ask.\n\nIf you have to challenge the companies, don't stop fighting.\n\nWhen you talk to the insurance company, try to do it online. That way, you can get a record of the conversation online. This can be really helpful."}
{"text": "MSNBC is at it yet again, slandering conservatives wishing to protect the religious liberties of business owners as \"anti-gay\" bigots.\n\nThe latest example comes with the headline for Adam Serwer's March 21 story, \"Georgia Republicans tack anti-gay amendments onto unrelated bills.\" To his credit, Serwer himself avoided needless invective, giving a rather fair description of the controversy at hand, even though it was a bit paltry in space devoted to those favoring the legislation. What's more, Serwer seemed rather incurious as to how the average Georgian feels about corporate interests -- you know, the bad guys in the eyes of the Left when they favor tax cuts and other pro-business moves -- being a significant factor in scotching the bill (emphasis mine):\n\nA last minute attempt by Republicans in Georgia to pass an Arizona-style religious freedom bill failed Thursday, after the sponsor withdrew the proposal.\n\nGeorgia Republican State Senator Josh McKoon attempted to attach the measure to two unrelated bills in the state legislature, hoping to get the controversial measure passed on the last day of the session. McKoon said on Twitter that he had backed off after \"opposition from large moneyed special interests.\"\n\n\"It's the exact same legislation that was going around the nation that [Arizona Republican Governor] Jan Brewer vetoed,\" said Bryan Long, executive director of the liberal advocacy group Better Georgia. \"It would allow a business in Georgia not to serve anyone as long as they have a religious reason to do that.\"\n\nThe amendments, put forth by McKoon, are similar to legislation proposed by conservative state lawmakers across the country designed to make it easier to claim religious exemptions to laws that \"substantially burden\" religious belief. If a business refused to serve a customer for religious reasons or grant an employee certain benefits they might otherwise be eligible for, the proposal would also make it easier for the person to defend themselves in court by claiming that doing so would impair their ability to practice their faith. The proposals have been spurred in part by incidents in states where business owners have been unable to claim religious exemptions to state laws banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Georgia does not have a state law banning such discrimination.\n\nAfter Brewer vetoed a similar bill in Arizona, and Georgia lawmakers got an earful from business groups in the state like Delta and Coca-Cola, the Georgia version of the legislation appeared to have been left for dead by Republican leaders in the House.\n\nPro-LGBT rights activists discovered Thursday that McKoon had added amendments to bills related to unemployment insurance, one of which would deny benefits to public school workers during the summer. As of Thursday evening however, McKoon had withdrawn his amendment from one bill and said that the other one was unlikely to come up.\n\nSince this is the last day of the session, the proposal is dead for the year. It would have been the first such victory for religious conservatives, who have otherwise failed to get any such laws passed in nearly half a dozen states.\n\nIronically McKoon, the sponsor of the Georgia proposal, had introduced a separate bill in January that would have prevented lawmakers from voting on legislation introduced at the last minute.\n\n\"It winds up producing bad public policy,\" McKoon said at the time."}
{"text": "Earlier this year, I published a project I was working on, a general purpose NodeMCU breakout board (Multi-purpose NodeMCU breakout PCB). I designed this board to securely carry a NodeMCU board, a 4-channel level shifter, a DHT22 sensor, and breakout headers for every pin on the NodeMCU, on a self-contained PCB.\n\nSince then, I've been using these boards as remote temperature/humidity sensors all over my house, as well as LED controllers for kitchen under-cabinet lighting.\n\nRemote temperature sensor boards (MQTT)\n\nWS2812 Remote LED controller (MQTT)\n\nThe sensors allow me to chart temperatures throughout the house, and adjust heating/cooling registers in each room to try to equalize the system.\n\nNeedless to say, raw PCBs were not exactly well received by the missus, and I also wanted to have local temperature display, so after spending some time over the last week or so, I created this:\n\nThe enclosure is designed in Fusion360, printed on my Prusa i3. I added an OLED screen to locally show temperature and humidity, while the NodeMCU carrier board/temp sensor is fully enclosed behind it. Sensor is read once a minute, and sent to the local screen and my MQTT topic in openHAB.\n\nMy topic in openHAB is set up like this:\n\nNumber Temperature_Ensuite \"Ensuite Temp [%.1f F]\" <temperature> (SF_Ensuite,Temp_Chart_2) {mqtt=\"<[broker:home/Ensuite/temperature:state:default]\"} Number Humidity_Ensuite \"Ensuite Hum [%.1f %%]\" <humidity> (SF_Ensuite,Hum_Chart) {mqtt=\"<[broker:home/Ensuite/humidity:state:default]\"}\n\nI can then use the items in a sitemap, or view the chart with the tracked temp/humidity.\n\nFor anyone interested in making their own, I've published the design on Thingiverse, and published my version of the NodeMCU ESP8266 code on Github.\n\nI've also created how-to videos on my YT channel:\n\nI continue working on the design, making different iterations of the enclosure, e.g.:\n\n(DONE) WS2812 LED controller (smaller, no OLED screen/DHT, with JST connector)\n\n(DONE) PIR motion sensor\n\nDifferential Pressure sensor (for HVAC system flow monitoring)\n\nSound sensor (for presence detection)\n\nAir quality sensor\n\n…?\n\nI am now changing the software for the sensor to ESPEasy. Leveraging all of the work (and supported sensors) the ESPEasy team has done, I can focus more on the hardware/applications of my sensor, instead of spending redundant effort on making these sensors work. Adding new sensors (including analog) should be MUCH simpler going forward!\n\nHopefully, someone else finds this as useful as I have!"}

{"text": "In the 62nd minute of Minnesota United's 3-2 loss at Toronto FC on Saturday, Kevin Molino stepped up and took a terrible penalty kick that rolled right into the arm of Toronto goalkeeper Alexander Bono.\n\nBut here's what makes Molino worthy of United's big-money transaction that brought him to the MLS expansion team this offseason: He strolled right back up to the blocked ball and coolly slotted home the rebound.\n\nThat goal was Molino's second of the match and the second time he started the Loons' ultimately unsuccessful comeback. Several other attacking players had golden opportunities to score, including rookie Abu Danladi in the first half and substitute Johan Venegas late in the second. Only Molino capitalized.\n\nThe Trinidad and Tobago native has started and played 10 matches for United, missing one because of national team duty. He has five goals and three assists this season. But before the Toronto match, his last goal was in a 4-2 victory over Salt Lake on April 1, and his last assist was in a 2-2 draw at Houston on April 15.\n\nThe reason for Molino's sudden uptick in offense might have a bit to do with a lineup adjustment. Molino has played mostly on the right wing this season. But against Toronto, he played more centrally in a playmaking position. Danladi took his spot on the right.\n\n\"We put him underneath … to try to get him a bit more involved in the game and to try and see if he can link up with Ibson,\" coach Adrian Heath said. \"We've got the two midfield players [who] are both very good first touch, and they can find the little pockets of space in behind. And that's when Kevin's at his best. So I just wanted to see if we could get him on the ball a little bit more … and I thought we did a little bit.\"\n\nMolino\n\nMolino, though, isn't one to wax poetic about his two goals Saturday. Instead, he lamented the wasted chance of bringing the momentum of a big victory against one of the league's top teams into Sunday's matchup with the LA Galaxy at TCF Bank Stadium.\n\n\"Most important, the game is a team sport, and we all want to go home happy together, collectively, with three points,\" Molino said in a team news release. \"The two goals are good to keep my confidence up, and I look forward to the next game against the LA Galaxy.\"\n\nHeath said the challenge with Molino is just to give him opportunities. Because as the penalty-kick-gone-wrong-turned-right evidenced, Molino won't squander them.\n\n\"He's a quality footballer,\" Heath said. \"I expected before this season started, he'd get double figures in both categories [goals and assists]. So if he stays healthy, he'll get his 12 to 13 goals.\n\n\"But more importantly, we need to keep him involved in the game because that's the hardest thing with football, to score and make goals. So the more we can keep him active and in and around the game and the ball, the better he's going to be.\""}

We'll have to wait and see, I guess.\" He'll be waiting for the phone to ring again at his home in Utah, where he became the NBA's third-most winningest coach of all time (1,221-803) before abruptly stepping down last February. After 23 seasons, the job became too taxing for the longest tenured coach in league history.\n\nBack when he first walked away from the Jazz, Sloan wasn't mentally and physically ready to jump right back in and set up camp on another sideline. But anyone who has ever spent time around him could hardly see Sloan permanently adopting the lifestyle of the gentleman farmer back on his spread in McLeansboro, Ill.\n\n\n\"Before, I was just visiting with people [from teams], but they knew that I wasn't ready to coach … back in the summer,\" said Sloan, who returned to his house in Utah in recent months. \"I didn't know if anybody was going to call [after that]. Maybe they won't. I don't know what my reaction would be. I had some people call when they'd lost their coaches. I was honest with them.\"\n\nBut the honest truth has changed since then. And considering energy has played such a significant part in Sloan's decision-making, he's sounding as if a return could be in the cards.\n\n\"My energy level has changed a great deal since I quit coaching,\" said Sloan, who is an avid walker. \"It's changed a lot now.

{"text": "IN THE 1990s black Americans began returning in significant numbers to the South. This marked a reversal of the Great Migration, in which their parents and grandparents fled Jim Crow racism in the 1920s and 1930s for jobs in the industrial cities of the north-east, Midwest and West. But since 2000 the destination of many inner-city blacks has shifted again, according to details from the latest census. From Oakland to Chicago to Washington, DC, blacks are surging from the central cities to the suburbs.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\nAnalysis of 2010 census data by William Frey, chief demographer for the Brookings Institution, shows that more than half the cities with large concentrations of blacks have seen significant declines in their black populations. About half of black Americans now live in the suburbs, up from 43% in 2000.\n\nThis is proving a mixed blessing. Well-educated blacks are finding better jobs, bigger houses and newer schools, just as white-flight suburbanites did in previous generations. But many lower-income migrants from the inner cities are finding poverty, crime and poor social services when they arrive in their new homes. In the past decade, poverty has increased more than twice as fast in the suburbs as it has in the cities.\n\nAlthough the black exodus is happening across the country, its consequences are especially vivid in Seattle and nearby Portland, two of America's whitest big cities. In each of these cities, blacks were squeezed by restrictive property covenants and racial prejudice into a small but highly visible central district—black-majority islands in a white sea.\n\nBy 2010 the islands had largely gone. Seattle and Portland had become \"smart cities\", magnets for hordes of young, highly educated and highly paid newcomers, most of them white and childless. Hungry for \"diversity\" and rushing into relatively rundown black neighbourhoods, they snapped up the only housing bargains left. White-owned banks were eager to make loans to yuppies. Tens of thousands of houses were gutted and rebuilt. As gentrification gathered pace, property prices exploded. Black homeowners cashed in, taking their windfalls to the suburbs. Black renters were squeezed out by higher rents.\n\n\"My clientele has all moved away,\" says Charlene Williams, owner of De Charlene's Beauty & Boutique in Seattle's Central District. Her neighbourhood was 79% black when she set up shop in 1968. It was 58% black as recently as 1990. Now it is 21% black. Ms Williams once had 13 hairdressers on her payroll; now she employs none. The young Ray Charles once performed in black-owned nightclubs in the Central District. Those clubs are gone, as are the restaurants where Ms Williams used to buy pork-chop sandwiches and peach pie. Eateries now offer crepes, wood-fired artisan bagels and north-west fusion cuisine.\n\nThe total number of blacks in the greater Seattle area has grown in the past decade, but they are widely dispersed to suburbs such as Renton, a dozen miles away. A few thousand black Seattleites still get together on Sunday mornings. They drive in from the suburbs to downtown churches. \"There's a community,\" says Ms Williams, \"but no unity.\""}

It shows the rebel-controlled area (dotted red line). The Ukrainian controlled area is basically the rest (blue dotted line). Dobropole is in the red circle. Since the remaining two GRADs returned to Horlivka, they might have initially started their operation from there too. The route from Horlivka to Dobropole is selected by avoiding the main roads where Ukrainian checkpoints are, and also avoiding villages as much as possible. With a normal car this might be 1:41 hours driving. With GRADs maybe 3-4 hours? This means when they drive very early in the morning they will not likely be detected and filmed or photographed. Of course their plan was to attack and then get back to base without being noticed again. IF they had succeeded in this, how would this have looked like? It would have looked like as if the Ukrainians indiscriminately attacked civilians, because it was in the middle of THEIR territory... But luckily the plan failed. Conclusion: PLEASE DEAR READER understand this: SINCE THE BEGINNING the (pro)Russians have been staging deadly scenes to blame 'Right Sector' and 'Nazis' and you name it. It is their nature. They go to great length to get this done, because when they win the Information War, half of the battle is already won. UPDATE: Aah, look: the Russian Trolls ARE using this to blame Ukraine:\nThis how they transported the GRADs into Ukraine. Disguised as trucks! Это БМ-21 \"Град\" замаскированный под грузовой Урал.

{"text": "The World Economic Forum's annual gathering of globalist political, financial and cultural elitists is underway in Davos, Switzerland, but the organization's founder is planning an emergency Washington, D.C., meeting in 2017 for worried elites worldwide to discuss how to deal with President-elect Donald J. Trump.\n\n\"The World Economic Forum is listening to Donald Trump,\" Bloomberg's Stephen Morris and Erik Schatzker wrote on Sunday. \"The organization will convene a special meeting in Washington this year to discuss issues raised during the president-elect's campaign and the populist wave that swept him to victory, WEF founder Klaus Schwab told Bloomberg Television on Sunday. The gathering will explore U.S. investment and job-creation opportunities for companies that participate in the forum, he said.\"\n\nKlaus Schwab, who in 1971 founded the group that eventually became the World Economic Forum which hosts the annual retreat for business, political and cultural elites in the Swiss Alps, told Bloomberg that the event in Washington, D.C.—which was previously not planned—is going to be meant to address globalist concerns with the rise of populism as evidenced by the election of Trump to the presidency.\n\n\"It's very natural that with the new administration we plan a major event in the U.S. to see what are the implications of the new president and how the business community could engage,\" Schwab said, adding that in Davos in 2017 there are populists present who the globalists plan to hear from to try to assuage a \"silent fear\" of the masses.\n\n\"People have become very emotionalized, this silent fear of what the new world will bring,\" Schwab added. \"We have populists here and we want to listen. We have to respond to these individuals' fears and to offer solutions. It's not just enough to listen; we have to provide answers and that's what we're here for in Davos.\"\n\nSchwab said that the Davos gathering is not supposed to be about the glamorous parties and receptions for the elites present, or about the \"outrageous excesses of life\" exhibited by them there, but rather his goal is to create a \"global village\" where in the words of Morris and Schatzker \"participants can mull weighty issues facing the world without the distractions of a large city.\"\n\n\"My biggest fear is that we will believe there are very simple answers to very difficult questions,\" Schwab said. \"The right solution will require a lot of effort and many steps in the right direction. I am optimistic that in a new multi-polar world we still have the notion of a joined and shared destiny.\"\n\nIn 2017, the \"Party of Davos\" so to speak, the World Economic Forum's annual gathering there in the Swiss Alps, is as Breitbart News has previously reported a gloomier event than usual. Last year, the world elites gathered in Davos were certain that British voters wouldn't vote to Leave the European Union and that Donald J. Trump would never be elected president of the United States—and that all these fears of populist uprisings around the world would never materialize. But they were wrong, and now Davos attendees are scrambling to try to figure out why."}
{"text": "Developers Epic and DICE are focused on the future\n\nAt this point, most gamers probably won't be surprised to hear that the Wii U isn't a primary focus for third party companies. Well, you should never say \"never,\" but for the hopeful Wii U owners out there, both Epic and DICE have confirmed that Nintendo's newest platform really isn't their primary focus right now. That is to say, the Unreal Engine 4 and Frostbite 3 aren't catering to the Wii U.\n\nConsidering the Wii U is pretty much the same generation as the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, the revelation really isn't much of one. On the subject, Epic Games' co-founder Mark Rein explained that they simply aren't aiming for the current era of \"PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, or Wii U. It's next-gen technology.\" And that's where their aim is set.\n\nAs it stands, Epic can boast that the Unreal Engine 3 remains the best non-Nintendo engine for the Wii U. So when it comes to the Unreal Engine 4, Epic really wants to keep their eyes ahead on the fast-approaching next generation. Rein said:\n\n\"The truth is, if a developer wanted to take an Unreal Engine game and put it on Wii U, they could. Unreal Engine 3 is kicking ass on Wii U. The best games on Wii U are made on our technology. What more do you want from us?\"\n\nDICE has the same outlook when it comes to Frostbite 3 and Wii U support. Battlefield's Patrick Bach did a fair job of explaining things from a developer's perspective. Concerning Frostbite and the Wii U, he remarked:\n\n\"The biggest problem we have right now is we don't want to back down from what we see as our low spec machines. We right now don't have support for the Wii U in the Frostbite engine. The reason for that is it takes development time. What should we focus on to create the best possible Battlefield experience? We are now focused on PC and the current-gen platforms, and then there might be other platforms in the future that we can't talk about...\"\n\nDICE has already confirmed that Battlefield 4 won't be released to Wii U. Recently, BioWare did announce that Dragon Age III and the next Mass Effect would both be running on Frostbite 3.\n\nIf you're curious to see exactly what Epic's Unreal Engine 4 can do, the studio has been eager to show it off in tech demos. The most recent one, seen at GDC, will undoubtedly leave you breathless.\n\nUpdate (3/31/2013): Just to be clear, the Unreal Engine 4 can run on current-gen hardware, even if Epic is choosing to focus on next-gen. In an interview with Engadget, Mark Reins laughed over entire thing, and everyone's apparent overreaction to the obvious. He clarifies:\n\n\"You heard the stupid gaffe yesterday about the Wii U. If someone wants to take Unreal Engine 4 and ship a game on Wii U, they can! If they wanna ship an Unreal Engine 4 game on Xbox 360, they could make it happen.\"\n\nThanks for the tip, nnnddd101010!"}
{"text": "Lawyers have raked in more than $7.5 billion in fees from the federal Disability Insurance program since 2009, according to a Manhattan Institute report issued Friday. And that money has come directly out of the pockets of workers through the Social Security payroll tax.\n\nThe report, \"Wheels of Fortune,\" finds that fees paid by the Social Security Administration to those representing disability applicants totaled $1.23 billion last year.\n\nBy October of this year, these fees had already topped $970 million.\n\nThe way the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program works is that, if a person secures legal representation while applying for benefits, and then qualifies for the program, the advocate gets a cut of the money.\n\nThe idea behind these payments — which are capped at $6,000 per enrollee — is to make sure that no one is denied disability benefits simply because they can't afford to navigate the system.\n\nBut as the Manhattan Institute report notes, lawyers have \"found ways to exploit legal rules in disability statutes to their personal benefit.\" The paper highlights allegations of fraud, kickbacks and other schemes to get the maximum number of people on the disability rolls.\n\nIn addition, those who've been turned down twice by the program can appeal their denials to an administrative law judge, some of whom have a record of approving 90% or more of those appeals.\n\nNot surprisingly, the amount of money lawyers collected in SSDI fees nearly tripled between 2001 and 2013.\n\nAt the same time, the number of workers on disability has been climbing at a rate far faster than people known to have disabilities.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2010, SSDI rolls shot up 48%, even though the number of actual working-age disabled climbed only 15%, according to Census Bureau data.\n\nAlmost half of the nearly 9 million workers collecting SSDI benefits had enrolled in the program in just the past five years.\n\nNot surprisingly, SSDI's costs have exploded as well, with spending up 155% since 2000 — faster than other major entitlement programs. Social Security, for example, climbed 90% over those years; Medicare spending rose 153%; and Medicaid was up 125%, budget data show.\n\nAnd at $140 billion, the federal government now spends more on disabled workers than it does on education, housing aid, and food stamps combined.\n\n\"Disability insurance has become more like permanent unemployment insurance or a general welfare program,\" notes Tad DeHaven of the Cato Institute.\n\nTo be sure, the extent to which aggressive fee-seeking attorneys are to blame for the sharp rise in the disability rolls isn't entirely clear.\n\nBut the promise of those fees, combined with looser eligibility rules and more generous disability benefits, has created the perfect entitlement storm.\n\nLeft unchecked, SSDI's trust fund will go bankrupt in 2016, forcing Congress to take some action to avoid a massive benefits cut. The disability boom also is draining funds from Medicare — since enrollees are eligible for that program after two years.\n\nAnd it's dampening economic growth, because those who go on SSDI almost ever rejoin the workforce, thereby shrinking the available pool of labor.\n\nFollow John Merline on Twitter: @IBD_JMerline"}
{"text": "Following Donald Trump's surprise visit to Mexico City to meet with President Enrique Peña Nieto on Wednesday, Mexicans are wondering if Hillary Clinton will follow her Republican challenger's lead across the border.\n\nPeña Nieto said he invited both candidates over for a chat, but only got one RSVP in return. Will Clinton send hers next?\n\nThe Clinton campaign confirmed they had received a letter from Peña Nieto but did not give further details on a potential meeting.\n\n\"Secretary Clinton last met with President Peña Nieto in Mexico in 2014 and our campaign is in a regular dialogue with Mexican government officials. She looks forward to talking with President Peña Nieto again at the appropriate time,\" a Clinton aide told Fusion in an email when asked if the Democratic candidate would also make the trip south.\n\nFor now it's unclear if the \"appropriate time\" will come during or after the campaign. Instead the Clinton camp is criticizing Trump's performance in Mexico.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Donald Trump has made his outlandish policy of forcing Mexico to pay for his giant wall the centerpiece of his campaign. But at the first opportunity to make good on his offensive campaign promises, Trump choked,\" said Clinton campaign chair John Podesta in a press release. \"What we saw today from a man who claims to be the ultimate 'deal maker' is that he doesn't have the courage to advocate for his campaign promises when he's not in front of a friendly crowd.\"\n\nBut would Clinton benefit from visiting the Mexican president during her campaign?\n\nPeña Nieto probably would. If Clinton did decide to go it would help the Mexican president justify his meeting with Trump by showing that his invitation was in fact about opening a dialogue with both candidates, and not just a failed attempt to mollify Trump's hardline stance on immigration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it's unclear what incentives Clinton would have for making her own quick trip to Mexico. The Democrat already has a big lead in the polls with Latinos voters in the U.S., and has the support of Mexicans in Mexico by virtue of being Trump's opponent.\n\nPlus, Clinton doesn't have to prove that she can act diplomatic or presidential. As secretary of state she's met many world leaders already. A handshake with Peña Nieto, an unpopular president tied to a series of security and corruption scandals in Mexico, isn't exactly the boost Clinton is looking for right now.\n\nThe press could also give Clinton trouble if she goes to Mexico. The media might ask her about corruption scandals in Mexico, the flow of firearms across the border, the NAFTA free-trade agreement signed by her husband, the U.S.' position on the disappearance of the 43 students from Ayotzinapa, or the pending extradition of drug lord Chapo Guzmán. Any words that she utters on any of those touchy issues in Mexico would provide fodder for media headlines for days—and not necessarily the type Clinton wants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClinton, as Secretary of State, showed signs that she understood the importance of Mexico as a partner to the U.S. But a trip to Mexico right now would involve many risks and few returns. There's always the incentive of building a bridge with a neighboring country, but for now she appears to be prioritizing the election over diplomacy."}

To verify that the account number and routing information is correct, the brokerages automatically send small \"micro-deposits\" of between two cents to one dollar to the account, and ask the customer to verify that they've received it.\n\nMichael Largent allegedly used a script to open 58,000 online brokerage accounts in the names of cartoon characters, and other aliases.\n\nHank Hill courtesy Fox BroadcastingLargent allegedly used an automated script to open 58,000 online brokerage accounts, linking each of them to a handful of online bank accounts, and accumulating thousands of dollars in micro-deposits.\n\nI know it's only May, but I think the competition for Threat Level's Caper of the Year award is over.\n\nLargent's script allegedly used fake names, addresses and Social Security numbers for the brokerage accounts.

{"text": "This week's post concerns vehicle towing, which hopefully will be more interesting that you might imagine. The data comes from Open Baltimore and consists of approximately 62,000 vehicles towed over the last five years (October 23rd, 2010 to November 12th, 2015). Unfortunately, for each towing, a street address, rather than a latitudinal and longitudinal coordinate, is recorded. However, thanks to the power of Google (and a few bucks from yours truly), it is possible to convert almost all of these addresses (98.3%) into latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates, which can then be visualized. Doing so gives a broad overview of towing in the city:\n\nFrom the above visualization it is possible to discern that the majority of towing occurs downtown. However, it is difficult to accurately compare between regions due to overplotting (i.e. the number of vehicles towed from the same location cannot be differentiated). A two dimensional density plot circumvents this concern:\n\nThe disproportional number of vehicles towed from downtown visually compresses the variation between other regions of the city. After excluding downtown and midtown, the same plot highlights other areas of the city with a large number towed vehicles.\n\nWith latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates, it is possible to pinpoint exact locations with the greatest number of towed vehicles. Not surprisingly, the majority of these points were downtown, although a notable number occurred at the MedStar Union Memorial Hospital to the north and at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institute to the east:\n\nIn line with the above observations, the University of Maryland Medical Center, in the lower left hand corner below, topped the list with the greatest number of vehicles towed:\n\nAdditionally, specific streets had a disproportional number of vehicles towed. The top ten streets, reflecting ~12.5% of all towing, are:\n\nStreet Number of Towing N. Charles St. 1159 W. Lombard St. 1018 E. Fayette St. 849 E. 33rd St. 813 Reisterstown Rd. 759 Hillen Rd. 698 St. Paul St. 670 Greenmount Ave. 577 E. Monument St. 559 E. Lexington St. 533\n\nPlotting these points over a road map captures their geography:\n\n\nOverlaying these points with the density map from above illustrates that these streets significantly contribute to areas of high density towing:\n\nDude, where's my car?\n\nFor each towing, whether the vehicle was flagged for being stolen is noted. Many of the vehicles marked as stolen were towed from neighborhoods in west Baltimore:\n\nTurf wars\n\nFinally, the data also includes which company towed the vehicle. Plotting the six companies responsible for ~95% of all towing reveals clear regional differences:\n\nMany companies compete for the high number of vehicles downtown, including City Towing and Greenwood Towing, both of which principally tow from downtown. However, the competition becomes more regionalized in the city's periphery, and McDel's Towing, Frankford Towing, Universal Towing, and Jim Elliott's Towing show strict regions of operation:\n\nThat's it for this week. I hope you enjoyed the post, and stay tuned!\n\nReproducibility"}

I must say I'm not sure how I feel about this since I did want him to reconcile with Surge with whom he broke up with years ago. Now considering he has all the skills and/or memories of all the X-men his pliable sexuality may be a side effect of his former powers.

{"text": "According to reports out of Korea, Chinese audiences won't be able to watch South Korean television shows on streaming services anytime soon, due to an ongoing political dispute disrupting ties between the two countries.\n\nOver the weekend, Korean news outlet Yonhap reported that China has blocked videos of South Korean music and television dramas from streaming services. The move came as part of continued economic backlash by the Chinese government in response to South Korea deploying the United States' Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system near Seoul.\n\nSouth Korea is stationing the anti-ballistic missile system on its soil as a deterrent against North Korea, but China objects to THAAD, on the grounds of its ability to threaten Chinese territorial security, while simultaneously raising tension between the Koreas.\n\nMany Chinese streaming services have stopped updating video clips of South Korean entertainment. According to Yonhap, one website posted on its social media account that \"everybody should be aware of the reason for this,\" referencing the Chinese government's toughened stance on Korean cultural imports.\n\nSouth Korea television dramas and variety shows are extremely popular in China, with popular shows garnering billions of views on Chinese streaming sites and reality series, like Running Man, getting remade by China. The widely popular 2016 drama Descendants of the Sun was viewed over 4 billion times on Chinese website iQIYI, and resulted in China's Ministry of Public Security issuing warnings about the danger of watching too many Korean dramas.\n\nBlocking access to South Korean streamed content comes after months of increasing economic retaliation by Beijing. In August, shortly after South Korea announced plans to deploy THAAD, the New York Times reported that K-pop boy band EXO had several concerts in China canceled. Several actors were also unable to hold events and the Times reported that joint Chinese-Korean television projects were put on hold.\n\nThe same month, China's official press agency Xinhua cited a survey that claimed over four-fifths of China's population would support a ban of South Korean entertainers if the government proposed one. \"It reflects Chinese placing love for their home country before popularity of entertainment stars,\" wrote Xinhua.\n\nAs South Korea moved forward with THAAD, China continued to move against imports. In January, the Korea Times reported that the rejection of 19 Korean cosmetic \"K-Beauty\" products by Chinese authorities was part of China's politically-oriented financial response to South Korea's actions. The same month, China canceled 3 performances by Grammy award-winning soprano Sumi Jo.\n\nSince the summer, SM Entertainment and YG Entertainment, Korea's largest K-pop agencies, saw their stock prices plummet to their lowest point in five years. Both companies have made broad attempts to enter international markets and have held multiple concerts in China. SM in particular has focused on Chinese audiences: Multiple singers signed to the agency are Chinese or of Chinese descent, such as f(x)'s members Victoria and Amber, while both Super Junior and EXO have formed subunits that release Mandarin-language music, and promote primarily in China.\n\nAlong with the external political crisis wreaking havoc on Korea's arts and entertainment, South Korea is still dealing with a presidential impeachment trial and a blacklist that restricted over 10,000 Korean artists."}

But, I do think Sheffield United are a good side and will be up in the top six.\n\n\"I don't think they're going to fall over.

{"text": "Well after asking around a bit I've found a general idea of the final price. Assuming between 21 and 40 mugs are ordered the base price will be 6.55USD per mug. I believe this is the overall price per mug with design included. I'm going to double check with Glass With a Twist just to be sure. Inside the U.S. Should be relatively cheap. I found a box which will ship flat rate. Good news is it can hold up to four mugs. Bad news is that if you want just one mug then shipping will be the same price. This means that the final price for one mug plus shipping will be 17.90USD plus some cheap insurance on the package. Around 18.50USD. After that, 3 more mugs can be added at no additional insurance increase and only the price per mug. Since there are two different designs then this should be good news to those who would want one of each. Now I must apologize to those in other countries for I have to be the bearer of bad news. I had an estimate done for shipping to Australia (about as costly as international shipping can get) and for a cheap rate, it would cost 28.00USD per mug. This is because only 4 lbs. are allowed to go though the cheapest rate and each mug weighs nearly that in box. For those in other countries who are interested though, I have two suggestions. 1) Give me a location I can ship to and I'll go ask FedEx and UPS as well for their rates, in person. Maybe they will be cheaper. Just email me and I'll get an estimate back. 2) I can give you the images used for the mugs via email should you be interested. If you have a company in your country that could produce etched glassware then feel free to use those images. Even if each glass would cost 20.00USD to make that is still cheaper than the shipping. Feel free to email me. I'll begin taking orders now for those who are interested. For the two designs, refer to the one with wheat on the edges as \"Wheat\" and the other as \"Dress\". If you would like multiple orders then say something such as Wheat x2 Dress x4 If you have any other questions then ask in the email. I'll be collecting the money prior to shipping. I'll produce an exact total BEFORE placing an order so you can give a final confirmation that you wish to purchase. I have also been promised a return policy by the glass manufacturer in case something like the handle breaks off. From my experience so far they're bar quality glasses. I think I've even seen them around town in restaurants minus the engravings. One final note, some people complained in a thread a few days back about the face. Upon viewing the pictures in more detail, I believe it is mostly the camera quality (cell phone). Without gray scale as a viable engraving source some shortcuts are required such as filling in the eyes. I for one am extremely happy with how the demo mugs turned out though if it means anything.\n-EDIT-\nAll payment will be handled though Paypal using the email, pyritesalesman@gmail.com\nWith your order include a state, or if international, a country. This way I can give an estimate."}
{"text": "Drugs Lessen Multiple Sclerosis Damage in Mice\n\nAt a Glance In a mouse study, 2 drugs already on the market activated stem cells and repaired the type of brain damage seen in multiple sclerosis (MS).\n\nMore research will be needed to determine whether the drugs could lead to novel MS therapies.\n\nMegan Kern, courtesy of Case Western Reserve University.\n\nMS is a disease in which a nerve-insulating compound called myelin is mistakenly attacked by the immune system. The breakdown of myelin disrupts communication between the brain and the body, leading to muscle weakness, numbness, and problems with vision, coordination, and balance.\n\nWhat triggers the disease is unknown. Anti-inflammatory drugs, which modulate the immune system, can help prevent the episodic relapses common in MS. However, they're less effective at preventing chronic disease and disability. An alternate approach might be to develop therapies that promote myelin repair.\n\nMyelin is laid down around nerve cells by specialized cells called oligodendrocytes in a process called myelination. Oligodendrocytes are derived from stem cells called oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). OPCs multiply in the brains of MS patients, but for unknown reasons fail to form oligodendrocytes that can remyelinate nerve cells.\n\nA research team led by Dr. Paul J. Tesar at Case Western Reserve University and Dr. Robert Miller at George Washington University investigated whether drugs already approved for other uses could stimulate OPCs and boost myelination. The study was partially funded by NIH's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). Results appeared online inNature on April 20, 2015.\n\nThe scientists began with mouse OPCs and screened compounds for their ability to boost production of a protein that marks oligodendrocytes. They tested more than 700 drugs with a history of safe use in humans. The compounds came from a drug library maintained by NIH's National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS).\n\nThe researchers found that 2 compounds, miconazole (an antifungal) and clobetasol (a steroid), stimulated mouse OPCs into generating oligodendrocytes. Tests confirmed that the drugs also induced human OPCs to differentiate into oligodendrocytes.\n\nThe team next examined whether the drugs could improve remyelination when injected into a mouse model of MS. Both drugs were effective in activating OPCs to enhance myelination and reverse paralysis. Almost all of the animals regained use of their hind limbs. Further investigation showed that the drugs acted through 2 distinct molecular mechanisms.\n\n\"Our ultimate goal was to enhance the body's ability to repair itself,\" Tesar says. The researchers caution that more research is needed before these drugs can be tested to treat people with MS in clinical trials. The compounds are currently only approved for use as creams or powders on the surface of the body. Their safety when used in other forms, such as injections, is unknown.\n\nThe research team is also planning to expand the library of drugs screened against OPCs in the near future to identify other promising compounds."}
{"text": "There is no greater food than chocolate. I'll do just about anything for chocolate. Perhaps the only thing that's greater than chocolate itself, is some other item covered in chocolate. Like chocolate donuts, chocolate covered raisins, or chocolate lava cakes. Then there is the liquid form of chocolate. On the liquid side, all trust is placed with chocolate milk. (Actually, I have this Chocolate Zinfandel sauce I got in California…O.M.G..sooo good…anyway, back to chocolate milk)\n\nIf you like chocolate milk – I've got a deal for you. You can drink more of it. In fact, you can replace your after-workout recovery drink with it. Cause it's been scientifically proven to aide muscle recovery just as much as Gatorade. A study published a while back in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism discusses the merits of chocolate milk over other sports recovery drinks. Check this out:\n\n\"In the study, nine male cyclists rode until their muscles were depleted of energy, then rested four hours and biked again until exhaustion. During the rest period, the cyclists drank low-fat chocolate milk, Gatorade, or Endurox R4. During a second round of exercise, the cyclists who drank the chocolate milk were able to bike about 50% longer than those who drank Endurox, and about as long as those who drank the Gatorade.\" (Article)\n\nAnd it's not just random scientists that's drinking the stuff after workouts. My former hometown University of Washington Huskies football team even uses it after every practice. Each player is required to drink a small carton before leaving the field.\n\n\"The Huskies are experimenting with a new form of nutritional replacement following practices. Along with giving the usual water and sports drinks to rehydrate and replenish during grueling preseason practices, Washington's football staff is requiring its players to drink a small carton of fat-free chocolate milk. \"It tastes good to me and, hey, if it's nutritious and helps my body, I'm all for it,\" wide receiver Cody Ellis said.\" (Article)\n\nSo there ya have it – do you really need any more excuse now to down chocolate?\n\nI've actually been using it since last summer and I've found it works pretty well. While I can't scientifically pinpoint chocolate milk as helping me personally to recover, I can say it seem to help…and heck – it certainly tastes better than some of the recovery drinks out there.\n\nSpeaking of which, I usually just make my own chocolate milk from Hershey's Chocolate Syrup. I recently noticed that they have a 'Lite' version that has 50% less calories. I figured I'd give it a shot. Based on my extensive testing (really, it was hard work!), it tastes the same. The only interesting thing I've noticed is that it doesn't seem to mix as easily as the regular stuff. Meaning, it takes a bit more oomph to get it to mix 'cleanly' into the chocolate milk. Ya know…like 4-5 more seconds of work. Just in case you were curious about the difference between the two options.\n\nSo go forth and drink thy chocolate milk!"}
{"text": "The ExoWorlds\n\nThe ExoWorlds list of exoplanets and their host stars being available for public naming at the initiative of the IAU is a list compiled from several exoplanet databases, including exoplanet.eu [2] and exoplanets.org [3].\n\nThis list includes well-studied exoplanets discovered over twenty years, up to 31 December 2008. A period of at least five years since the discovery has been considered as a simple and satisfactory criterion to include exoplanets which can be considered as confirmed. All the discoveries were made using various methods, including radial velocities, transits, microlensing and direct imagery.\n\nFor these exoplanets, the scientific nomenclature follows the nomenclature rules widely adopted by the scientific community, which are drawn from the rules for naming binary stars. For each planet, the name of the host star (around which planets are orbiting) is followed by a lower-case letter: b for the first discovered exoplanet, c for the second, etc. (The letters are capitalized in the case of binaries: the \"primary\" star name is followed by \"A\", and its companion stars are labelled by the same name followed by \"B\", \"C\", etc.).\n\nIn the ExoWorlds list, five stars already have common names: Fomalhaut (alpha Piscis Austrini) is one of the four \"royal stars\" of ancient Persia, with Aldebaran, Antares, and Regulus; Pollux (beta Geminorum) is the twin brother of Castor, son of Zeus (Jupiter) and Leda, from the ancient Greek and Roman mythologies — the constellation Gemini is named after them (Gemini means twins in latin). Three other stars also have common names: gamma Cephei (Errai, Arabic for shepherd), epsilon Tauri (Ain, Arabic for the bull's eye) and iota Draconis (Edasich, Arabic also). These stars have common names as well in other cultures [1].\n\nConsequently these five stars cannot be considered for public naming.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Kunitzsch, P, and Smart, T., 2006, \"A Dictionary of Modern Star Names\" (2nd Revised Edition, Sky Publishing, Cambridge, MA, USA)\n\n[2] Schneider, J., Dedieu, C., Le Sidaner, P., Savalle, R., and Zolotukhin, I. 2011, \"Defining and cataloging exoplanets: the exoplanet.eu database\", Astronomy & Astrophysics, vol.532, id.A79, 11 pp.\n\n[3] Wright, J.

{"text": "On Friday morning, before Donald Trump's campaign rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin, the speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly, Robin Vos, posted an op-ed greeting him with the words, \"Welcome to Wisconsin, Mr. Trump, but let's get something straight - we are Ryan Republicans here in Wisconsin, not Trump Republicans.\"\n\nVos went on to say of Trump, \"I'm embarrassed that he's leading our ticket,\" in the opinion piece posted on RightWisconsin.com. The Assembly speaker objects in particular to Trump's unwillingness to endorse Ryan before the Wisconsin primary, which is Tuesday. Ryan does not appear to be in much danger of losing the primary -- he's popular not only in his district, but also statewide.\n\nStill, Vos slammed Trump for his \"kind words\" for Paul Ryan's primary opponent, Paul Nehlen, declaring that \"it revealed a lack of judgement [SIC] from our nominee that I just cannot look away from or forgive.\"\n\nTrump tweeted this earlier in the week, after Nehlen had praised Trump.\n\nThanks to @pnehlen for your kind words, very much appreciated. -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 1, 2016\n\n\nVos called on Trump to admit he'd made a mistake in \"supporting a bigot like Paul Nehlen, who said we should ban a religion.\" Trump has not endorsed Nehlen. And of Ryan, Trump said that he's \"not there yet\" on an endorsement, an echo of Ryan, who had said the same thing when he didn't immediately endorse Trump, once he had clinched the GOP nomination.\n\nThe top Republicans in the state are all skipping the Trump rally Friday. Gov. Scott Walker, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, will be touring flood damage in the northern part of the state, while Paul Ryan will be in his district, and Sen. Ron Johnson cited \"prior commitments,\" according to the Journal Sentinel.\n\nTheir lack of participation isn't surprising -- Ted Cruz walloped Trump in the Wisconsin primary and the statement Trump issued after his loss insulted the winner, the governor and the state's Republicans. \"Lyin' Ted Cruz had the Governor of Wisconsin, many conservative talk radio show hosts, and the entire party apparatus behind him,\" the campaign's statement that night read.\n\nWalker's eventual endorsement of Trump was a tepid one, and after Trump withheld his endorsement of Ryan, Walker immediately tweeted that he stood with Ryan.\n\nWe stand with Paul Ryan! pic.twitter.com/O16vThk5dA — Scott Walker (@ScottWalker) August 3, 2016\n\n\nOn Thursday, Walker expressed frustration with the GOP nominee's messaging, as stories about Trump's remarks about the parents of Capt. Humayun Khan continued to dominate the news.\n\n\"What's frustrating to me is I wish Donald Trump would just talk about Hillary Clinton, and what he's going to do to make everyday Americans' lives better,\" Walker told WISN's \"Jay Weber Show.\"\n\nWalker also made it clear he's not with Trump on his comments about the Khans. \"I will never question a Gold Star family on anything,\" Walker said. \"They deserve our respect.\" Johnson has explicitly called on Trump to apologize to the Khan family."}
{"text": "Published College Program Standards\n\nProgram standards apply to all similar programs of instruction offered by publicly-funded colleges across the province. The development of program standards by the Ministry first started in the 1990s to bring more consistency to college programming, broaden the skills of college graduates to include essential employability skills and provide accountability for the quality and relevance of college programs.\n\nEach program standard for a postsecondary program of instruction includes the following elements:\n\nVocational learning outcomes (the vocationally specific learning outcomes which apply to the program in question),\n\nEssential employability skills* (the essential employability skills learning outcomes which apply to all programs of instruction), and\n\nGeneral education requirement (the requirement for general education in postsecondary programs of instruction).\n\nThe vocational and essential employability skills components of program standards are expressed in terms of learning outcomes.\n\nCollectively, these elements outline the essential skills, knowledge and attitudes that a student must reliably demonstrate in order to graduate from a program. Expressing standards as vocational learning outcomes ensures consistency in the outcomes for program graduates, while individual colleges offering the program of instruction determine the specific program structure, delivery methods and other curriculum matters to be used in assisting students to achieve the outcomes articulated in the standard. Individual colleges also determine whether additional learning outcomes will be required to reflect specific local needs and/or interests.\n\nVocational learning outcomes and elements of performance\n\nThe learning outcomes set out the culminating demonstration of learning and achievement that the student must reliably demonstrate before graduation. Learning outcomes are inter-related and when viewed as a whole, they identify what students will be able to do at the completion of a program.\n\nThe purpose of the elements of performance is to provide support for the learning outcomes so that there is clarity as to what level and quality of performance is required to meet the intended outcome. The elements of performance represent a means of tracking progress toward achievement of the intended outcome. Accordingly, graduates are expected to perform at the level of the vocational learning outcomes at program completion, not at the level of an individual element of performance. The elements of performance do not stand alone but collectively describe the vocational learning outcome.\n\nHow program standards are developed\n\nThe ministry develops and reviews selected program standards annually. A program standard is developed through a broad-based consultation process involving a range of stakeholders with a direct interest in the program area, including employers, professional associations and program graduates working in the field, in addition to college students, faculty and administrators. It represents a consensus of the participating stakeholders on the essential learning that all program graduates should have achieved. Program standards are updated depending on changing requirements of the sector. This ensures that standards continue to be appropriate and relevant to both the needs of students and employers.\n\nHow program standards are used\n\nWhere they exist, program standards provide the basis for curriculum development in the college system. They influence the kinds of learning activities that program faculty design for students and how students are evaluated. Students will have a clear indication of what they are expected to learn and demonstrate. Program standards promote accountability for program quality.\n\nSelect the links below to view those standards available online.\n\n* Essential Employability Skills (ESS) replaced the Generic Skills Standard (GSS) in 2005 as per the Framework for Programs of Instruction (appendix A and B)."}
{"text": "\"I think the only major financial institution that Glass-Steagall would have a major effect on is probably Citi, which still has some of the supermarket elements,\" Bernanke added. Bernanke: I'm 'puzzled' by the focus on Glass-Steagall\n\nBen Bernanke is \"a little puzzled\" by the focus of some Democratic presidential candidates on reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act as a means of regulating or breaking up financial institutions, the former Federal Reserve chairman said Wednesday.\n\nDemocratic candidates Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley have pledged to reinstate the Depression-era act that created a separation between commercial and investment banking, and was repealed in the 1990s when Bill Clinton was president. Hillary Clinton's proposal for Wall Street reform does not include an explicit call for the break-up of so-called \"too big to fail\" financial institutions.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\"I'm actually a little puzzled by the focus on that particular provision,\" Bernanke said during a discussion with POLITICO's Ben White at an America's Fiscal Future event in Manhattan. \"I think that if you look at the actual, what happened a few years ago in the crisis, that Glass-Steagall was pretty irrelevant to it because you had banks like Wachovia or [Washington Mutual] that went bad because they made bad loans, and you had investment banks like Bear Stearns and Lehman that went bad because of their investment banking activities.\"\n\nEven if Glass-Steagall were still in place at the time of the financial crisis, \"it would have had no effect on most of these firms,\" he said, including AIG, which required massive and repeated bailouts.\n\n\"I think the only major financial institution that Glass-Steagall would have a major effect on is probably Citi, which still has some of the supermarket elements,\" Bernanke added.\n\nFor the most part, though, he remarked, \"it would just be an example of breaking up firms for the purpose of breaking them up without a clear rationale for doing that. I think there are other ways to simplify banks that would be more effective.\"\n\nPart of that, Bernanke said, is simplifying banks to make them smaller and more efficient.\n\n\"We are moving towards a situation where banks are now evaluating their own size and complexity in light of the fact that on the one hand, there are economic benefits to size, but on the other hand, it's becoming much tougher to be a big bank,\" he said, referencing the fact that larger banks \"are trying to shrink\" because they do not want to hold as much capital as is required of the largest institutions.\n\n\"You put the incentives in the right place and force banks to think about whether their size and complexity is justified in an economic sense, or whether it basically could be dispensed with and you could get simpler banks. I think over time, the pressure will be on banks to simplify,\" he added, touting the example of the liquidation authority under the Dodd-Frank Act that gives regulators the ability to more cleanly unwind a bank on the brink of collapse.\n\n\"Just breaking them into tiny little pieces, you're going to lose a lot of value if you do that, without thinking about what the economics is,\" he added."}

{"text": "If you followed the financial drama of 2008-09, you might remember \"the scariest chart ever\" — a graphic comparing U.S. jobs losses during the crisis to those in previous downturns. The '08-'09 crisis was by far the worst since the Great Depression.\n\nThat \"scariest chart\" is now history as the U.S. has regained all those job losses. But Capital Economics has published a new one that might just might deserve that same name — if you're a real estate owner in Greater Toronto.\n\nThe chart compares Toronto house prices, as measured by the Teranet house price index, to the city's sales-to-new-listings ratio — basically the number of homes sold as a percentage of new homes coming on the market.\n\nThe chart shows that house prices follow the ratio up and down very closely — what happens to the ratio happens to prices a few months later. And right now, for Toronto, that ratio has dropped off a cliff:\n\nNow, don't panic just yet. What this chart shows is that house prices are in for a decline on the scale seen during the financial crisis — from which Toronto's market quickly bounced back.\n\nBut the risk is that even more homeowners will put their houses on the market, and/or demand for homes will decline even further than it has already (sales dropped by a steep 20.3 per cent in May).\n\nAnd if that happens, prices will likely fall even further.\n\n\"The housing boom is over, with a correction in prices coming.\"\n\n— David Madani, Capital Economics\n\nDavid Madani, Capital Economics' senior Canada economist, recently predicted a 40-per-cent price drop for the Toronto area — likely the most pessimistic prediction out there.\n\n\"Overall, the incoming data suggest that the housing boom is over, with a correction in prices coming,\" Madani wrote in a client note Wednesday.\n\n\"With banks pulling back, alternative mortgage lenders getting squeezed and tighter regulatory policy curbing demand, housing will likely become a drag on the economy this year.\"\n\nBut that price correction hasn't quite arrived. Although Toronto's average house price dropped in May, that number tends to be volatile from month to month, and the benchmark price of comparable homes continued to rise last month.\n\nThe May edition of the Teranet-National Bank house price index, released Wednesday, recorded a 28.7-per-cent increase from the same month a year earlier. Month to month, Toronto recorded its strongest price growth ever, with prices rising 3.6 per cent from April to May.\n\nAll the same, the sudden decline in sales and equally sudden spike in new listings has most analysts predicting at least a cooling off — something that might actually be welcome news for homebuyers, as Toronto's affordability levels have hit historic lows.\n\n\"That trajectory is exactly what the region needs,' CIBC Capital Markets economist Benjamin Tal wrote earlier this month. \"A market that is falling due to the force of its own gravity as opposed to an external shock.\"\n\nWhat's Going On In Housing?

{"text": "(MENAFN - Investors Ideas)\n\nVANCOUVER - April 4, 2017 (Investorideas.com Newswire) The David Suzuki Foundation is encouraged by the release of the BC Green Party's climate change platform, which includes numerous proposals to help B.C. regain its status as a climate leader. The platform includes ideas that the David Suzuki Foundation has long advocated for, such as:\n\nReinstating annual increases to the provincial carbon tax incentive Applying the provincial carbon tax to include fugitive emissions from oil and gas companies Increasing provincial government investment in public transit and cycling infrastructure Legislating a zero-emission vehicle standard to increase the availability of non-emitting vehicles Supporting energy efficiency improvements to buildings across the province\n\n\"The BC Green Party platform makes several key pledges to restore B.C.'s reputation as a climate action leader,\" Foundation science and policy director Ian Bruce said. \"This is the first platform we've seen from a major B.C. party that goes beyond the minimum standard for carbon pricing set by the federal government.\"\n\nThe BC Green Party has committed to a range of policies to put B.C. back on track to reach its target of 40 per cent below 2007 levels by 2030. With current provincial policies, B.C.'s emissions are projected to rise.\n\nThe platform includes a pledge to raise the province's carbon tax by $10 per year for four years beginning in 2018, surpassing the federal government's requirement for provincial carbon pricing policies to achieve a price of $50 per tonne of emissions by 2022.\n\n\"It's promising to see the Climate Leadership Team recommend a commitment to mid-term emissions reductions targets,\" Bruce said. \"B.C. has a real opportunity to prosper in the emerging clean energy economy, but we need to take action immediately if we don't want to be left behind.\"\n\nMissing from this announcement are details of a funding framework for public transit infrastructure investment and a firm commitment to expand the use of low-impact renewable energy sources such as wind, solar and tidal power to achieve the province's energy needs.\n\nThe Foundation's 2016 report Breaking Gridlock: B.C.'s transit investment deficit and what can be done to fix it recommends that the provincial government live up to its 2008 pledge to provide 43 per cent of the funding for new transit projects, reducing the burden on local governments by empowering municipalities to raise new sources of revenues.\n\n\"Expanding public transit through reliable provincial funding and expanding the use of low-impact renewable energy in B.C. are two things we can't afford to overlook,\" Bruce said. \"Excluding job-creating industries like wind and solar power in favour of big hydro projects fails to recognize the potential of these rapidly growing industries.\n\n\"We look forward to hearing more details about all parties' climate action strategies as the election unfolds.\"\n\nMedia contact:\n\nEmily Fister, Climate Change & Clean Energy Communications Specialist\n\nDavid Suzuki Foundation\n\n604-440-5470\n\nRenewableEnergyStocks.com: investing ideas in renewable energy stocks Like Renewable Energy Stocks?

{"text": "The '7 worst words in the world' could signal trouble for this stock market, warns Oaktree Capital's Howard Marks\n\n45% of Americans pay no federal income tax\n\n77.5 million households do not pay federal individual income tax\n\nMany Americans don't have to worry about giving Uncle Sam part of their hard-earned cash for their income taxes this year.\n\nAn estimated 45.3% of American households — roughly 77.5 million — will pay no federal individual income tax, according to data for the 2015 tax year from the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan Washington-based research group. (Note that this does not necessarily mean they won't owe their states income tax.)\n\nAlso see: Americans pay more in taxes than for housing, food, clothes combined\n\nRoughly half pay no federal income tax because they have no taxable income, and the other roughly half get enough tax breaks to erase their tax liability, explains Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.\n\nDespite the fact that rich people paying little in the way of income taxes makes plenty of headlines, this is the exception to the rule: The top 1% of taxpayers pay a higher effective income-tax rate than any other group (around 23%, according to a report released by the Tax Policy Center in 2014) — nearly seven times higher than those in the bottom 50%.\n\nRead: Compared to most countries, we're undertaxed\n\nOn average, those in the bottom 40% of the income spectrum end up getting money from the government. Meanwhile, the richest 20% of Americans, by far, pay the most in income taxes, forking over nearly 87% of all the income tax collected by Uncle Sam.\n\nRead: Compared to most countries, we're undertaxed — honest\n\nRich people pay nearly 87% of all federal individual income tax in America\n\nIncome level Share of total federal\n\nindividual income tax paid Average income tax bill\n\nper person Lowest 20% -2.2% -$643 Second lowest 20% -1.7% -$621 Middle income 4.2% $1,743 Second richest 20% 12.9% $6,285 Richest 20% 86.8% $50,176\n\nSource: Tax Policy Center\n\nThe top 1% of Americans, who have an average income of more than $2.1 million, pay 43.6% of all the federal individual income tax in the U.S.; the top 0.1% — just 115,000 households, whose average income is more than $9.4 million — pay more than 20% of it.\n\nWhen it comes to all federal taxes — individual income, payroll, excise, corporate income and estate taxes — the distributions of who pays what is more spread out.

{"text": "Finally, an update to the very outdated mod_blog that's been available since September 3, 2009. There still isn't much documentation because, as of yet. I doubt what's here is enough but for the most dedicated to go through the code to see how this works. REQUIREMENTS If you don't meet these requirements, then you probably won't get very far. The software was written in C (don't bother asking for Perl code---there isn't any, and there won't be any) and as such, makes certain assumptions, such as: * Linux (or any POSIX compilant UNIX system) * GCC (or any C99 compiler that may come with your system) * Apache * Lua 5.1 or higher The code right now assumes you'll be running this under Apache. COMPILATION You'll need to install my CGILIB library (6.6 or higher) to compile this blog software. You can install it from https://github.com/spc476/CGILib To install it once it's downloaded, all it should take is \"make\" and then \"make install\" as root. The library assumes a POSIX environment and should compile as is on most modern Unix systems. Once that is installed, you should be able to do a \"make\" and generate the blog engine. It's built as a setuid program to avoid having a world-writable directory, but if that is a concern, you can certain remove the setuid'ness of it, but make sure the data directories are writable by Apache. INSTALLATION The assumption on the blog engine is that the executable resides in a directory visible to Apache and runnable from within Apache's docroot for the the site in question. I have my copy named as \"boston.cgi\" and Apache configured to execute such programs via CGI. The htdocs/ subdirectory contains a sample website to run the blog. There's also a sample htaccess file that shows the method I use to run the blog engine. In the journal/ subdirectory is out-of-band files (which should not be served up by Apache). There you will find a sample configuration file and a sample entry to see how the data is stored (each entry is a separate file, stored under a Year/Month/Day directory structure). And yes, there is code to do email notifications, but it's not enabled by default. I only left the code in to support the half dozen people that did sign up to receive email notifications. The HTML entry form works, but it's not my primary method for new entries---for that, I use email. I have the following line in '/etc/aliases': myjournal: \"/path/to/boston.cgi --config /path/to/config --email --cmd new\" To make an entry, I format an email to the journal address as: +-----[top of file]---------------------------- |author: [who you set at author---exact match] |title: [title of entry] |class: [keywords] |status: [status repeated on Facebook] |adtag: [keyword used for advertising network] | |body of entry, usually including HTML | ... +---------------------------------------------- And that's pretty much it. Good luck."}
{"text": "Microsoft's Office team has been on a roll. In the few past months, it's been busy creating the upcoming Office 2016 for Windows, as well as new universal apps for Windows 10 that work on mobile devices just as well as the desktop. It turns out Mac users, however, will be the first to see what the team has up its sleeve this year.\n\nMicrosoft has just released a preview of Office 2016 for Mac, which includes updated versions of Word, Excel PowerPoint, OneNote and Outlook. All of these are now optimized for retina displays, support full-screen views and have revamped ribbon interfaces.\n\nAs you'd expect, they're also connected to the cloud for accessing your files anywhere. Curiously, there's only support for Microsoft services at the moment: OneDrive, OneDrive for Business and SharePoint.\n\nMicrosoft announced a partnership with Dropbox on its mobile Office apps last month, and recently began adding support for other platforms too, so we wouldn't be surprised if these made their way into Office for Mac by the time the full product is released.\n\nOf course, there are a ton of new app-specific features as well.\n\nWord's design tab helps manage layouts, colors and fonts throughout a document, while a navigation pane similar to the one in PowerPoint makes it easy to find the pages you're looking for. Comments are now threaded too, which should make editing sessions a lot less of a pain.\n\nExcel features improvements to charts, graphs, keyboard shortcuts and data entry, including a formula builder and autocomplete. New functions added in Excel 2013 for Windows helps make the app more powerful, while assuring your calculations will work across platforms.\n\nFor users working on more complicated statistics, the Analysis ToolPak introduces several statistical functions like moving averages and exponential smoothing.\n\nPowerPoint is introducing a nifty 'Presenter View' feature, which basically works as a hub only the speaker can see; it can display your next slides, a timer and notes, while your audience only sees the current slide. There's also a new animation pane and slide transitions to add some pizzazz.\n\nThe new Outlook is basically an update to what Microsoft introduced back in October, which isn't a bad thing. There's an improved conversation view that automatically threads your conversations, and message previews now show you the first sentence of an email in addition to the subject line.\n\nFinally, Microsoft has also been pushing out updates to OneNote recently, all of which are included in Office 2016. You can now organize your notes more effectively with tags, and use optical character recognition (OCR) to parse text from images and handwriting.\n\nAlthough Microsoft pushes out small updates to its Office for Mac intermittently, the last time the apps saw a full revamp was 2011. There isn't an exact launch date for the final version of the productivity suite, but the company says to expect it sometime this summer.\n\nIf you want to give it a try, head on over to Microsoft's Office for Mac page – you can install it alongside your older version of Office if you want. Just keep in mind you'll have to be running OS X Yosemite to get it installed.\n\n➤ Office for Mac 2016\n\nRead next: Forget MVPs, startups need to create minimum 'lovable' products"}
{"text": "The United States Anti-Doping Agency informed the UFC that Brock Lesnar failed a drug test on the night he fought Mark Hunt.\n\nThe positive test, coupled with the formality of a \"B\" sample showing a similarly dirty result, means that Lesnar likely forfeits his win, part of his purse, and two years of any MMA career the professional wrestler hoped to pursue. The UFC's former heavyweight champion previously tested positive for an out-of-competition test in the lead-up to the Hunt bout. In both instances, Lesnar reportedly popped positive for clomiphene, an estrogen inhibitor typically taken at the conclusion of a steroid cycle to block the natural surge in estrogen that accompanies the unnatural surge in testosterone. It also helps the body naturally produce testosterone after a steroid cycle signals the body to stop producing much of it. Clomiphene, among other effects, helps prevent the growth of breasts in males using steroids. In women, it promotes fertility. This substance also found its way into the urine of Chael Sonnen and Jon Jones before their suspensions.\n\nThe UFC released a statement addressing the development:\n\nThe UFC organization was notified today that the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) has informed Brock Lesnar that his in-competition sample collection from July 9, 2016, at UFC 200, has tested positive for the same substance as his previously announced out-of-competition collection on June 28, 2016. USADA, the independent administrator of the UFC Anti-Doping Policy, will handle the results management and appropriate adjudication of this case. It is important to note that, under the UFC Anti-Doping Policy, there is a full fair legal review process that is afforded to all athletes before any sanctions are imposed. The Nevada State Athletic Commission also retains jurisdiction over this matter as the sample collection was performed at UFC 200 in Las Vegas. Consistent with all previous potential anti-doping violations, additional information will be provided at the appropriate time as the process moves forward.\n\nLesnar looked like his old, young self in a dominant victory over Hunt after nearly five years away from the sport. He took down the Super Samoan at will in the first and third rounds, viciously pounding his face with fists, forearms, and elbows from the top position. The judges saw it unanimously 29-27 for Lesnar.\n\nBut Hunt saw this all coming. He criticized USADA for granting a waiver to Lesnar to return to competition without the usual four-month testing window preceding it. The New Zealand-born fighter battled Antonio Silva to a draw several back before results showed Big Foot used banned substances. That fight, as the fight with Lesnar will eventually do, reverted to a \"no contest.\" Hunt also battled at least five other fighters besides Silva and Lesnar linked to performance enhancers during their careers through failed and dodged tests. Hunt, evidently experienced in spotting the signs in opponents, described Lesnar as \"juiced to the gills\" prior to the bout.\n\nLesnar joins other UFC legends, including Anderson Silva, Frank Mir, and Jon Jones, in testing positive for banned substances. The promotion instituted a stringent new screening regime administered by USADA, which not only figures to catch more malefactors but promises to punish them more, too."}

See Privacy/Disclaimer for more information. Some pattern names are the registered trademarks of their respective owners.\n\nStatistics updated on 8/17/18\n\nFor more information on this pattern, read Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns Second Edition , pictured on the right, pages 149 to 163. That chapter gives a complete review of the chart pattern, compared to what is described below.\n\nCup-with-Handle\n\nImportant Bull Market Results for Cup with Handle Overall performance rank (1 is best): not ranked Break even failure rate: 5% Average rise: 52% Throwback rate: 62% Percentage meeting price target: 62% The above numbers are based on 912 perfect trades. See the glossary for definitions.\n\nCup with Handle Identification Guidelines\n\nCharacteristic Discussion Price trend Upward leading to the pattern. I use a 6-month look back (high to high). If price is higher at pattern start than 6 months ago, then I accept it. Otherwise, I visually check to see it's in a short-term uptrend. I no longer require a 30% upward move. Shape A rounded turn that looks like a cup with a handle on the right. U-shaped cup The cup should be U-shaped, not V-shaped. Handle The cup must have a handle on the right. Cup duration From 7 to 65 weeks Handle duration 1 week minimum with no maximum. Handle Forms in upper half of cup. Cup Cup rims should be near the same price level but be flexible.\n\nCup with Handle Trading Tips\n\nConsult the associated figure on the right.\n\nTrading Tactic Explanation Measure rule Measure the height from the right cup lip ( A ) to the lowest valley ( B ) then multiply by the above 'percentage meeting price target.' Add the result to the breakout price ( A ) to get a target. Inner cup Cups often form within cups (points 1 and 2 ), so trade the inner cup when price rises above the handle (the dashed green line at point 3 ). Trendline If possible, draw a down-sloping trendline along the handle peaks. A close above the trendline signals an early buy. I show this as the blue line extending down from point A on the chart to the right. Buy Buy when price closes above the right cup rim (point A , and the top horizontal red line). Stop The handle low (point C ) is a good place to put a stop. Raise the stop as price rises. Throwbacks Throwbacks hurt performance. Short handle Stocks with handles shorter than the median 22 days show superior post breakout performance. The Measure Rule\n\nCup with Handle Example\n\nThe figure on the right shows an example of a cup with handle chart pattern. The rise leading to the cup with handle begins at C and reaches the left cup lip at point A . Since this is on the weekly scale, the price chart appears narrower than usual, but price rounds downward forming a cup with the right cup lip at B . The handle lasts a few weeks before price begins moving up. The next week, price rockets upward about seven points.\n\n-- Thomas Bulkowski\n\nOther Cup with Handle Examples"}
{"text": "Mushrooms normally grow outside in the grass, but what do you do when they're sprouting in your bedroom? Fungus and mold can take hold in your carpet and start to spread if you don't invest in regular cleaning. Once they appear, getting rid of the growth can be tricky. Bleach isn't a solution because it will also destroy your carpet, but other cleaners may not kill the spores. The good news is that you can rid your carpet of the growth and reclaim a healthy home. Here's what you need to know about carpet fungus and how to combat it.\n\nSigns of Carpet Mold\n\nSometimes, you can see the mold on the carpet and you know you have an issue. Other times, it's slowly spreading beneath the carpet in hidden areas. Be wary of musty odors because they can indicate the presence of mold. If people in the home have allergies and you notice that they're struggling with them year-round, then mold is likely present.\n\nMold on the top of your carpet will commonly appear as discoloration, so be wary of black, brown, white or green stains on the rugs. If your carpet has been wet recently, then you should run a dehumidifier to prevent mold from forming. Finally, if you still aren't sure, peel up one corner and take a peek under the carpet to see if mold is present.\n\nSources of Carpet Mold\n\nMold needs moderate temperatures, food, and water to survive. Any part of your home can provide the right environment if there is a water leak in the area. Mold can easily use your carpet as a food source, and it only takes a small amount of moisture to start the process. If you find carpet mold, you must also find the water source and correct that problem. Otherwise, the mold will just return at a later time.\n\nThe Dangers of Mold\n\nNot all mold is deadly, but it can all cause respiratory problems for people with allergies. It can spread unchecked if not corrected and removed. The spores break off readily and drift through the air, so it can start forming in other areas of the home. Given enough time, it can cause serious illness and structural damage, so it's important to address the issue as soon as possible.\n\nLift, Vacuum, Steam Clean\n\nStart by lifting any large areas of mold and removing them from the carpet. Put a damp paper towel over any chunks of growth, fold the towel around it and place it in a plastic garbage bag. With the largest chunks removed, start vacuuming the mold. Once most of the mold is vacuumed up, you can steam clean the carpet to blast out the remnants of mold and clean them away. Run a dehumidifier in the area to remove any residual moisture and stop the growth. Finally, lift the carpet in that area to ensure that you don't have mold growing underneath it.\n\nIf you have found mold on your carpet, you may be worried that you need to buy new carpeting. However, professionals at High Quality Carpet can address the problem for you. We can kill the spores with safe cleaning solutions and effectively remove most mold infestations. Before you call for new carpet, call us to see if we can address the situation and save your carpet."}

{"text": "Donald Trump and Wilbur Ross. REUTERS/Mike Segar We've heard a lot of disconcerting things about trade from the Trump administration, but in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross may have just topped them all.\n\nIt was about a new tariff the administration just put on Canadian lumber.\n\n\"I wouldn't regard the Canadian situation as being anything like the war with ISIS, but it certainly is a very precise set of tariffs on a very precise set of imports,\" Ross said. \"The reason we're putting it on is Canada's forests are owned by the various provinces, and the provinces charge very discounted, we believe, very subsidized prices to the lumbermen, which in turn lets them get a subsidized low price coming into the US.\"\n\nHe continued (and this is that part that should actually be more upsetting than the ridiculous ISIS reference, emphasis ours): \"It simply seems unfair because in the US most of the forests are privately owned and therefore pay full-price market rate for the stumpage.\"\n\nOh, now we slap tariffs on countries because something simply \"seems\" unfair?\n\nThat's not exactly how this works.\n\nThe privatization of US timberlands goes all the way back to the Homestead Act of 1862. We chose a private model for that industry, and no other country can make us change it. Canadians chose a different model, and no country can make them change it.\n\nAs Carnegie Mellon economist Lee Branstetter pointed out to Business Insider, this reality has for a while been a sticking point for the US and Canada for the same reason Ross cited: It seems unfair. But the thing is, according to World Trade Organization rules, it's not.\n\nHere's a relevant passage from the WTO and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, from 1947 and 1994, to explain (via Reuters):\n\n\"The products of the territory of any contracting party imported into the territory of any other contracting party shall be accorded treatment no less favorable than that accorded to like products of national origin in respect of all laws, regulations and requirements affecting their internal sale, offering for sale, purchase, transportation, distribution or use.\"\n\nIn other words, member nations can't enact laws that favor domestic industries over foreign ones, but this isn't a law. This is simply the nature of Canada's logging industry. It seems unfair. But technically, it's not.\n\nEt tu, Wilbur?\n\nSo now we're doing trade policy based on how things feel? I saw this coming from the head of the White House National Trade Council, Peter Navarro, who has repeatedly said he feels our trade with Germany is unfair because it negotiates as a member of the European Union rather than by itself.\n\nBut billionaire investor Ross? Less so. Then again, last month he told CNBC he was \"horrified to learn that billions of dollars of [WTO] duties that have been won after ... hard-fought cases have never been collected.\"\n\nIn other words, he's a newbie here, just like everyone else in the White House now — with a boss looking for wins anywhere they can be found. Maybe that means starting fights out of thin air; maybe it doesn't.\n\nBut that's sure what it seems like."}

I'm delivering my postal route,\" Grays responds.\n\nSeconds later, the situation escalates and an officer demands for him to \"stop resisting.\"\n\n\"I'm not resisting!\" Grays says.\n\nGrays is led away in handcuffs, with his mail truck left unattended.\n\n\"The only thing I think saved me is that it was on videotape,\" Grays said. He said he tried to comply with the officers' orders.\n\n\"Never been arrested, never received a summons. I was extremely terrified. I wouldn't say afraid - I passed the stage of afraid,\" Grays said. \"I was afraid that if I didn't comply that something was going to happen to me.\"\n\nGrays was frisked and put in an unmarked patrol car. That's when the video ends.\n\nOn the ride to the precinct, Grays said he was told to \"shut up a numerous amount of times.\"\n\n\"They rear ended the car and I wind up from the back seat, banged my left shoulder onto the driver seat and banged my face into their armrest,\" Grays said.\n\n\"If it can happen to the mailman, it can happen to anyone in the community,\" said Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams.\n\nAdams, who is also a former NYPD captain, released the video to the public.\n\n\"Those officers were extremely aggressive and I believe that they wanted him to resist. He was smart enough not to resist,\" he said. \"I believe because of that, he's sitting here today telling his story.\"\n\nThe NYPD has been hit with other caught-on-camera incidents of alleged police harassment against people of color, including the 2014 death of Eric Garner.\n\n\"One grabbed my arm and I said, 'You know, my wife is a cop.' He told me he doesn't care,\" Grays said.\n\nGrays hasn't returned to work yet. He said he wants justice. To him, that means disciplinary action.\n\n\"I don't want them to be jobless because they might have family, kids they need to support,\" Grays said. \"It's sad that I thought that when I put on a uniform that I'll be treated a little different, but it's no difference. You know, I'm just another brother with a uniform.\"\n\nGrays has a court hearing scheduled in early May for the disorderly conduct charges.

{"text": "Jakarta's Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, also known as Ahok, arrives for his court hearing in Jakarta\n\nJakarta's Christian governor may escape jail for alleged blasphemy after prosecutors Thursday recommended only probation, a day after he lost in a religiously charged run-off that damaged Indonesia's image as a bastion of tolerant Islam.\n\nThe recommendation of two years probation in the trial of Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, with a possible one-year jail term if he commits a crime during that period, was lighter than expected as he could have been sent to prison for several years.\n\nThe sentence demand for allegedly insulting Islam came after he was defeated Wednesday by Muslim challenger Anies Baswedan who was accused of pandering to hardliners to win votes in the race for the Jakarta governorship.\n\nAfter his victory, former government minister Baswedan celebrated with Islamic hardliners who helped organise mass protests in the capital against the governor by praying at a major mosque.\n\nThe blasphemy allegations and Purnama's subsequent poll loss have sparked fears that pluralistic traditions in the world's most populous Muslim country are under threat from the influence of hardliners, who pushed for the governor's prosecution.\n\nChief prosecutor Ali Mukartono recommended that Purnama, known by his nickname Ahok, be found guilty of blasphemy and be given two years probation, with a possible one-year jail sentence.\n\nHe said a light sentence was being recommended as Purnama had contributed to \"advancing the city of Jakarta\" and had acted politely during his trial.\n\n- Hardline anger -\n\n\"If within the two years, Ahok doesn't commit any new criminal act, like corruption, stealing... he will be free,\" his lawyer I Wayan Sudirta told AFP.\n\n\"If within that two years he does commit a criminal act, he has to serve the one-year jail sentence.\"\n\nA sentence recommendation is a normal step in an Indonesian court case, and is usually followed within weeks by a verdict.\n\nThe controversy began in September when Purnama, known for his outspoken style, outraged Muslims when he controversially quoted a passage from the Islamic holy text ahead of elections for the Jakarta governorship.\n\nHe insinuated that his opponents had used a Koranic verse to trick people into voting against him.\n\nAn edited version of his speech went viral online, sparking outrage far beyond Jakarta, where Purnama has ruled since his predecessor Joko Widodo became president in late 2014.\n\nThe governor apologised but Indonesia's highest clerical body declared the remarks blasphemous and urged authorities to bring charges\n\nBefore the blasphemy controversy erupted, Purnama enjoyed a large opinion poll lead due to his determination to clean up traffic-clogged, polluted Jakarta.\n\nThe trial started in December and dragged on for months, with both the prosecution and defence calling more than 40 witnesses. Purnama's team have accused the prosecution of calling biased witnesses, saying that many were not even present when the alleged blasphemy took place.\n\nCritics want the country's blasphemy laws overhauled. The legislation was rarely used during the 32-year rule of strongman Suharto, but in recent years it has been exploited to persecute minorities, rights groups say."}

Considerable suspicion has fallen on a local Benghazi militia, Ansar al-Sharia, known for its intensely conservative and anti-democratic Islamist politics.

The regional Qaeda affiliate, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, is active near Libya but has focused primarily on attacking local governments.\n\nSpeaking on CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" Mr. Magariaf said that Libya has arrested as many as 50 people over the assault. At least a few, he said, had come from outside Libya, possibly Algeria or Mali. And he also said that he believed the non-Libyans had been involved in planning the attack in the months since they entered the country, and that it was meant to coincide with the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nReferring to \"ugly deeds, criminal deeds,\" Mr. Magariaf insisted that the attacks \"do not resemble any way, in any sense, the aspirations, the feelings of Libyans towards the United States and its citizens,\" emphasizing the role of \"foreigners.\"\n\nAppearing on the same program, Susan Rice, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, said the attacks began \"spontaneously in Benghazi as a reaction to what had transpired some hours earlier in Cairo.\"\n\n\"But soon after that spontaneous protest began outside of our consulate in Benghazi, we believe that it looks like extremist elements, individuals, joined in that effort with heavy weapons of the sort that are, unfortunately, readily now available in Libya post-revolution,\" Ms. Rice said. \"And that it spun from there into something much, much more violent.\"\n\nThe United States did not believe the attack was preplanned or premeditated, Ms. Rice said, adding that whether the extremists \"were Al Qaeda affiliates, whether they were Libyan-based extremists or Al Qaeda itself I think is one of the things we'll have to determine.\""}

Kronos One was the flagship of the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.\n\nContents show]\n\nHistory Edit\n\nIn 2293, Chancellor Gorkon traveled aboard Kronos One to meet the Federation starship USS Enterprise-A, which was to escort it to a peace conference on Earth. During the journey, however, Kronos One was fired upon, apparently by the Enterprise, and seriously damaged by two photon torpedoes. Once Kronos One was disabled, two assassins beamed over from the Enterprise, and began to systematically murder members of the crew, including Gorkon.\n\nAfter Kronos One had restored power, General Chang, the chancellor's chief of staff, took command and prepared to fire on the Enterprise, but Captain Kirk, hoping to preserve the truce, promptly surrendered. It was later revealed that Kronos One was actually fired on by an experimental Bird-of-Prey which had the unique ability to fire while under cloak, as part of a conspiracy to sabotage peace talks between the Federation and the Klingon Empire. (Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country)\n\nPersonnel Edit\n\nSee: Kronos One personnel\n\nAppendices Edit\n\nBackground information Edit\n\nThe name of the Klingon homeworld was first mentioned in The Undiscovered Country, in which it is identified as Kronos (spelled that way in the film's script). The spelling \"Qo'noS\" was subsequently devised by Marc Okrand for Star Trek: The Next Generation, in order to conform to his previously developed rules of Klingon orthography. In Klingonese, Kronos One would be written Qo'noS wa', but MA uses the script spelling for this ship. For more information see the talk page.\n\nThe Star Trek Customizable Card Game also uses the spelling Kronos One.\n\nThe name of this ship mimics Air Force One, the airplane of the President of the United States. (Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (Special Edition) text commentary)\n\nVisual effects director Bill George discussed the modifications made to the Kronos One in the January 1992 issue of American Cinematographer, and later in Charting the Undiscovered Country: The Making of Trek VI.\n\nIn the article he said:\n\n\"The model needed to be repainted anyway, so I proposed that we make it look very distinct from those in the first film, especially since it was one of the few models we could alter to look new for this show. We did some research into military costuming, and came up with the concept that when these ships return victorious from battle, the Klingons build some sort of epaulet onto their wings or paint a new stripe on. We painted the model brown and red with gold highlights, then added golden etched brass epaulets on it, based on some of the helmet designs we'd seen. It contrasts nicely with the Enterprise, which is very smooth and monochromatic and cool, while this Klingon ship is very regal and ostentatious and warm.\"\n\nThe Starships RPG sourcebook uses the spelling \"Quo'noS One\" and gives its registry as IKC-7748."}

{"text": "In one of the first major announcements to come out of this year's San Diego Comic-Con , Dynamite Entertainment has confirmed Masks , a new mini-series that not only sees the first team-up of classic pulp heroes like the Shadow, the Spider and the Green Hornet , but also sees Alex Ross' first full interior work on a comic in years . The book is written by Chris Roberson ( MonkeyBrain Comics , iZombie ).Although he's contributed pages to other Dynamite projects like Project Superpowers and Kirby: Genesis in recent years, Ross -- who made his name with the photo-realistic work on classic projects like Marvels and Kingdom Come in the 1990s -- hasn't handled the art chores for an entire comic since 2009's Justice Society of America Kingdom Come Special: Superman , and even then, he wasn't providing fully-painted art as he does in the first issue of Masks. In fact, his last solo painted project was JLA: Liberty and Justice , way back in 2003. What brought him back, he explained in a statement, is the chance to be part of history:\n\nFor years now, Dynamite Entertainment and I have desired to unite all of the varied pulp characters they've been publishing into one big crossover event. When the Green Hornet and Kato paved the way for a successful relaunch of the original masked duo characters, we knew that the grand prize of revivals should then be the ultimate original, the Shadow. Now, to be able for the first time in history to have these legends meet, along with fellow mysterymen; The Spider, Zorro, Black Bat, and others, makes this project a unique accomplishment. I always thought that illustrating the first hero archetypes like The Shadow would be a milestone in my career. I'm thrilled to touch upon the legends that began the very concept of the superhero in Masks with a crossover that is literally the longest overdue.\n\nThe series takes place in the late 1930s, as the newly-established Justice Party sweeps into political power in New York and quickly establishes a corrupt police state. With the authorities out for their own reward, it falls to costumed vigilantes to defend the powerless... and maybe make a change for the better in the way things are done, as well.\n\nMasks not only brings together characters who have their own Dynamite series like Zorro, the Green Hornet, the Shadow and the Spider, but -- as Ross hinted at above -- other pulp heroes from the same era, including the Black Bat, Miss Fury and more. The man responsible for writing all of this? None other than MonkeyBrain Comics' Chris Roberson, who calls the series \"the comic I've wanted to write since I first discovered the pulp heroes in the 1970s.\"\n\n\"When we were exploring writers, I emailed Chris and we spent a couple of emails back and forth and in that short span, he laid out a basic framework that was pitch-perfect for what we were looking for,\" Dynamite Editor Joe Rybandt said in a press release, explaining what made Roberson the right fit for the project. \"Alex had initially laid out a character list and high concept, but Chris added the flesh to the bonesand we've got something really cool coming together here.\"\n\n\nMasks launches later this year from Dynamite."}

Here's what builder Nick Birkby has to say about his T30s:\n\nI built two full size T30's using JBL 2206 drivers. The sound from these cabs is nothing short of STUNNING! The bass has real authority and is fast and dynamic! Overall, the cabs have a way of reproducing bass in a very effortless manner, even with with heavy DJ/ dance material. Such a change from that 'struggling woofer' sound you get from typical 2x15 cabs. The waveform of the bass is 'tactile' if thats the right word. You can almost sense the momentum the wave builds up while travelling the length of the horn. Like a friggin e xpress train when it emerges! Yes I am waxing a bit lyrical here, but the satisfaction of firing these up was unique treat! Construction was relatively easy for me using very limited tools. I built the second much faster than the first, and used a handheld circular saw for the internal cuts, the rest being cut to size by the timber guys. The sheer presence and authority of these cabs outweighs any hauling gripes. Big thanks to Bill and the excellent Forum resource!\n\nBuild options abound with the T30. They may be built from 16 to 30 inches wide, loaded with one or two ten or twelve inch drivers. Build costs start from about $180 for a 16 incher loaded with an Eminence BP102.\n\nTuba 45\n\nThe T45 is an oblong version of the T30. It uses the same drivers and has similar response to the T30, but its side profile measures 24 by 45 inches. Loaded with a ten inch driver it may be built as narrow as 13 inches, loaded with a twelve as narrow as 15 inches. The design is 'end firing', just like the T60, so it may placed laid down, or stood up on end where floor space is tight.\n\nConstruction Degree of Difficulty: 5\n\nPerformance Quotient: 10\n\nSuggested Audience Size, using 16 inch wide cabs:\n\n2 cabs to 300; 4 cabs 250-600; 6 cabs 500-1,000; 8 cabs 800-2,000\n\nWider cabs and dual driver cabs will handle larger audiences.\n\nEquivalent Retail Value: $899 to $2999, depending on cabinet size and driver complement.\n\nRecommended Tops: SLA Pro, TLAH Pro, DR200, DR250, DR280, OmniTop 12, OmniTop 15, Simplexx 10, Simplexx 12\n\nThe T30 and T45 are separate plans.

MacDonald would last exactly 1 minute before Lawler dropped him for the come-from-behind TKO.\n\nIt's been 13 months since MacDonald's lone shot at a UFC belt ended in devastating defeat, and while Lawler is no longer the champion, MacDonald is no longer with the UFC. The 27-year-old Canadian opted to sign with Bellator MMA in free agency, a move which was formally announced on last Friday's Bellator 160 card.\n\nDuring MacDonald's appearance on The MMA Hour on Monday, he brought up Lawler's UFC 189 drug test results, implying that Lawler may not have been fighting \"clean\" in their fight.\n\n\"Actually right before this conversation, something very interesting came up to me. We are going to have to see where it goes, but it has something to do with the title fight against Robbie Lawler. Some very interesting information just came about. We'll see what happens with that. I don't really want to speak too loud about it, but it's something that really grabbed my attention and I think a lot of people are going to be very interested to hear about this if it actually is true, I have to do my research.

I always believe in myself that if I work hard, work on my techniques, train hard that I can get to the top and be the best. The fact that whatever happened in there, if this is true, it pisses me right off to my core. Some test results came out four times higher than the limit for my fight with him. It could be bullsh*t. That's why we have to look into it. I don't want to start pointing fingers or anything. Look at that team's history.

{"text": "WayForward On Cancelled Shantae Games, And The Difference Between Pirate's Curse And Half-Genie Hero\n\nBy Ishaan . October 3, 2014 . 12:31pm\n\nWayForward Technologies have wrapped up work on Shantae and the Pirate's Curse, which is coming to Nintendo 3DS (and Wii U), and plan to release the game sometime this Fall. In a recent interview with Siliconera, series director Matt Bozon explained how they went about designing the game, which is heavily inspired by Metroid's non-linear gameplay—a first for Shantae.\n\nPirate's Curse isn't the first time that WayForward have experimented with Shantae in different ways either, although most of those other experiments haven't worked out. Back in the Game Boy Advance days, WayForward prototyped a game called Shantae 2: Risky Revolution, which was to be a sequel to the original Game Boy Color Shantae. The first world of the game was playable, and late last year, WayForward actually showed it off on a livestream for the first time. You can view this in the video embedded above.\n\nBeyond Risky Revolution, there were other prototypes that didn't get made into full games either, a lot of those being 3D games.\n\n\"We had a polygonal Shantae that could be run around in three distinct gameplay 'gyms',\" director Matt Bozon shared with Siliconera. \"One was a spline-scroller (like Namco's Klonoa), one was a free-range 3D like Mario 64, and the last was an isometric 3D platformer. We've done a lot of exploration in this area… Shantae was a sprite/3D hybrid for PlayStation and PC, and was free-roaming on the PlayStation 2.\"\n\n\"She even rode a river raft on the GameCube,\" he revealed. \"It's possible that we'll see a polygonal Shantae down the line, but only if it serves the style of gameplay we want to create at the time.\"\n\nNow that Pirate's Curse is done, Bozon is concentrating his next project, Shantae: Half-Genie hero, which is going to be an entirely different game. The most obvious difference between the two new Shantaes is that while Pirate's Curse is heavily inspired by Metroid, with its interconnected areas and gradual item progression, Half-Genie Hero is a more straightforward action platformer. We asked Bozon if there were any other notable differences between the two titles.\n\n\"The games are fairly different,\" Bozon said. \"The teams have no real crossover besides me and Jake (Virt) Kaufman. Half-Genie Hero is more about dancing, over-the-top spectacle, arcade action, and some light quest elements to keep it true to the series (and it's still in development, so anything can happen!). It's like a Shantae TV show come to life!\"\n\n\"Pirate's Curse has a deeper narrative and is more rooted in 16-bit stylings, even though it has higher resolution paintings and occasional voice over,\" he continued. \"Pirate's Curse expands the original gameplay and takes into new territory. Half-Genie Hero goes back to belly dancing and magic, but adds a ton of variety with more playable characters and HD visual design.\""}
{"text": "Jane Elliott is an educator whose famous blue eyes/brown eyes exercise showed social psychologists (and her students) the impact that racism has on education and how social psychology can be applied to real-world situations. In this lesson, we'll learn about the exercise and its impact on social psychology.\n\nJane Elliot\n\nJane Elliot was a white teacher from Iowa who wanted to help all men and women achieve equality.\n\nIn the 1960s, America was a country divided. The black civil rights movement had swept across the country, and as more and more African Americans fought for equality, many racists fought against them.\n\nIn the midst of this movement, Jane Elliott, a white teacher from a mostly white town in Iowa, watched as the world around her battled on the streets of cities like Atlanta, Chicago and Washington D.C. She, too, wanted to be involved in gaining equality for all men and women, regardless of race. But how?\n\nAnd then, one night in April 1968, a shot rang out in Memphis, Tennessee. As Jane Elliott watched the media coverage of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., she felt appalled by the way the white reporters could not seem to understand what the black community was going through.\n\nElliott realized that the problem was the disconnect between what whites knew about racism and what blacks experienced. So, Elliott developed an exercise to change the way her white students thought about racism.\n\nThe Blue Eyes/Brown Eyes Exercise\n\nOne morning after King's assassination, Elliott informed her class that they were going to change the way things were done. Blue-eyed children were given pride of place in the classroom. They were given extra recess time, a second helping of food at lunch, and they were allowed to sit at the front of the classroom and participate in class discussions.\n\nBrown-eyed children, meanwhile, were forced to sit at the back of the class and were more severely reprimanded for the same type of behavior that blue-eyed children got away with. Elliott even made up a scientific 'fact' that the melanin that caused blue eyes had been found to be linked with a higher intelligence.\n\nThe blue eyes/brown eyes exercise affected how students performed on assignments.\n\nThe results were stunning. By the end of the day, the blue-eyed children viciously put down the brown-eyed children. Not only that, but the quiet, struggling blue-eyed students did much better on class assignments, and the louder, successful brown-eyed students did not do as well.\n\nThe next day, Elliott reversed the exercise, promoting brown eyes as better than blue eyes. Much of the same results happened, though the brown-eyed students didn't taunt their blue-eyed classmates quite as viciously. By the end of the second day, when the exercise ended, the blue-eyed and brown-eyed children hugged and cried with each other. A class of all-white students had learned what racism felt like.\n\n× Unlock Content Over 75,000 lessons in all major subjects Get access risk-free,\n\njust create an account.

{"text": "Turkish President Erdoğan says gender equality 'against nature'\n\nISTANBUL\n\nFirst Lady Emine Erdoğan is pictured with her husband (R) at a political event. REUTERS Photo\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdoğan appears set to anger women and rights groups in Turkey once again after voicing his strong objection to the equality of women and men, instead recommending what he called \"equivalency.\"\"When we are able to look at human beings from the point of view of justice, then the elimination of discrimination between women and men would be possible in a much more fair, humane and conscientious way. What do women need?\" Erdoğan said Nov. 24, delivering a speech at an international gathering in Istanbul aimed at discussing women's rights and freedoms.\"Sometimes, here they say 'men and women equality.' But 'equality among women' and 'equality among men' is more correct. However, what is particularly essential is women's equality before justice,\" Erdoğan said at the Women and Justice Summit hosted by the Women and Democracy Association (KADEM).\"Equality is turning the victim into an oppressor by force or vice versa. What women need is to be able to be equivalent, rather than equal,\" the president said.He also reiterated an argument he voiced in the past, announcing: \"You cannot bring women and men into equal positions; that is against nature because their nature is different.\"\"For example, in work life, you cannot impose the same conditions on a pregnant woman as a man,\" Erdoğan said.The Turkish president has consistently exhorted women to have at least three children, while also terming abortion \"murder\" and railing against Caesarian sections.He also used the occasion to stage a strongly-worded attack on \"feminism and feminists,\" claiming that they \"reject the concept of motherhood.\"\"Our religion [Islam] has defined a position for women [in society]: Motherhood. Some people can understand this, while others can't. You cannot explain this to feminists because they don't accept the concept of motherhood,\" he said.Erdoğan quoted remarks attributed to Prophet Muhammad, saying \"Paradise lies at the feet of mothers,\" and also gave a personal anecdote: \"I would kiss my mother's feet because they smelled of paradise. She would glance coyly and cry sometimes. Motherhood is something else.\"The president's mother, Tenzile Erdoğan, passed away in 2011 at the age of 88.His speech at the Women and Justice Summit did not mark the first time he publicly praised motherhood. Back in 2008, he declared that designating just one day as Mothers' Day was an \"insult to mothers.\" \"In our beliefs, one kisses the feet of mothers. Paradise is next to the mother's feet. That's how we approach them,\" he said at the timeWomen rights activists and lawyers constantly criticize the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government, which was led by then-Prime Minister Erdoğan from 2003 until he was elected to the presidency in August, for the increasingly conservative and authoritarian political culture they say it is fostering.Turkey ranked 120th of 136 nations in the World Economic Forum's 2013 Gender Gap Index, down 15 places since 2006, while a 2011 U.N. report indicated that Turkey's domestic violence rates are almost twice those in the United States and 10 times higher than in some European countries."}
{"text": "These are the facts. At some point, someone somewhere in the US government had an amazing idea: why not build a compressed natural gas (CNG) filling station in Afghanistan? Forty-three million taxpayer dollars later, the city of Sheberghan, in the far north of the country, got its gas station. But, according to the watchdog agency probing Afghanistan reconstruction spending, nobody seems to know — or wants to admit — who signed off on the project or how its costs spiraled so completely out of control.\n\nThe whole thing is so strange and wrongheaded that the crazily high price tag — more than 100 times what a similar facility would cost in neighboring Pakistan — is not even the worst thing the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) found.\n\nNatural Gas? For what Cars?\n\nEven more troubling than the high price tag is that there was no point in building the gas station in the first place. While Afghanistan has vast natural gas reserves, it does not have a sufficient number of cars that run on natural gas, and converting a vehicle literally costs as much as the average Afghan earns in a year.\n\nHad a feasibility study been conducted, somebody probably would have figured this out, but SIGAR found no evidence of such a precaution having been taken.\n\nYou might think the Department of Defense (DOD) would want to get to the bottom of this waste of money. After all, the project was part of the Task Force for Stability and Business Operations (TFBSO), which was created by the Deputy Secretary of Defense and reported directly to the Office of the Secretary.\n\nInstead, DOD stonewalled.\n\n\"One of the most troubling aspects of this project is that the Department of Defense claims that it is unable to provide an explanation for the high cost of the project or to answer any other questions concerning its planning, implementation, or outcome,\" SIGAR John Sopko wrote in a letter to Defense Secretary Ashton Carter.\n\nDid the Dog Eat the Records?\n\nDOD's excuse for its lack of cooperation is that TFBSO, an $800 million program, was shut down in March of 2015 and now nobody is around to address SIGAR's questions. That didn't sit well with Sopko, who recently gave an exclusive interview to WhoWhatWhy in which he discussed the staggering amount of taxpayer funds wasted in Afghanistan.\n\n\"Frankly, I find it both shocking and incredible that DOD asserts that it no longer has any knowledge about TFBSO, an $800 million program that reported directly to the Office of the Secretary of Defense and only shut down a little over six months ago,\" he wrote to Carter.\n\nSopko vowed to continue the investigation to determine \"whether any conduct by TFBSO staff or contractors was criminal in nature\" — as opposed to just crazily lucrative — for some well-connected insiders.\n\nRelated front page panorama photo credit: CNG Pump Nozzle (Andreas Geick / Wikimedia).\n\nWhere else do you see journalism of this quality and value?

{"text": "Australia's central bank boss has urged workers to ask for pay rises for the good of the economy – an extraordinary call likely to reignite the penalty rates debate.\n\nSpeaking at a forum in Canberra on Monday, Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe pointed to record-low wage growth and labour's declining share of national income as major economic threats.\n\nHe said workers haven't been asking for more money because they fear losing their jobs to \"the foreigners and the robots\".\n\n\"When any one of us feel like there's more competition you are less inclined to put your price up. Firms act like that and workers act like that,\" Dr Lowe told the Crawford Australian Leadership Forum.\n\n\"We value employment security in an uncertain world and so we're less inclined to put our price up.\"\n\nOne solution Dr Lowe proposed was to \"put pressure on the labour market\" in the hope it would \"energise workers to overcome these fears of competition and uncertainty\" and start putting their hands out for more money.\n\nThat's economist speak for lowering the unemployment rate, which is thought to give workers more bargaining power when it comes to demanding pay rises.\n\nDr Lowe's comments were interestingly timed, given that the Fair Work Commission's cuts to the penalty rates of more than 600,000 low-wage workers will commence in the new financial year.\n\nThe Shop, Distributive and Allied (SDA) Union responded to the speech with the following statement: \"The Reserve Bank knows we need wages to go up. How come the Turnbull government is allowing a pay cut for hundreds of thousands of Aussies on 1 July?\"\n\nThere are two official measures of wages in Australia and both are at very low levels, as the chart below shows.\n\nThe RBA's Dr Lowe also acknowledged that the \"labour share of national income is in decline\".\n\nThis was a reference to the fact that Australia's latest gross domestic product (GDP) number showed that the share of GDP going to wage earners fell in the March quarter to 51.5 per cent, the lowest level since 2009.\n\nThe result was perilously close to a 53-year low. Before 2009, the wage share of national income hadn't been so small since it hit 51.3 per cent in 1964.\n\nMeanwhile, the share of national income going to profits rose to a five-year high of 27.5 per cent.\n\nInstead of being scared of the impact of technology – especially robots – on the labour force, Dr Lowe argued instead for a greater focus on the benefits of education.\n\n\"These problems we're talking about aren't going to be solved in one year or two years. They're going to be solved in a decade, maybe, if we're lucky. So in a decade you can really make a difference to the way we do human capital accumulation. It seems to me that needs to be the focus, rather than moaning about technology all the time,\" he told the audience.\n\n\"Does anyone here think we can make ourselves wealthier by not having improvements in technology and by actually going backwards on technology? It's kind of fanciful really.\n\n\"Technology is the basis of improvements in our living standards. So we've got to work out how to do that, how to survive in that, and I think that's the education system.\""}
{"text": "7-2-15\n\ntags: Civil War\n\nJoan E. Cashin is a history professor at Ohio State University\n\nThe Battle of Antietam - Wikipedia\n\nIn the national outcry over the Charleston Massacre, and the ensuing debate over the Confederate flag, most people white and black have assumed that the entire population of Southern whites supported the Confederacy in 1861.\n\nNothing could be further from the truth. In fact, perpetuating this false stereotype only serves the interests of the plantation class and those who support those values today.\n\nIn every American war, from the Revolution to the U.S. invasion of Iraq, some citizens have opposed the war effort. That was true for the Civil War. The country broke up in the aftermath of the presidential election of 1860, when the voters had to decide, should slavery expand into the trans-Mississippi West? The issue was not states rights per se, or the abolition of slavery in the U.S., but the expansion of slavery.\n\nFour candidates ran in that election, and they offered voters a clear choice. The Republican Abraham Lincoln of Illinois stated that the expansion of slavery had to stop. The Democratic Party could not agree on a candidate, so two candidates ran: John Breckinridge of Kentucky, who insisted that the slave states should secede if anyone tried to stop slavery's expansion, and Stephen Douglas of Illinois, who argued that the decision should be made by the territorial legislatures, before statehood.\n\nThe forgotten man of the election, Senator John Bell of Tennessee, ran as a Unionist candidate. He declared that all political issues should be resolved within the Union—that no political issue was important enough to justify secession. A former Whig, like Lincoln, he began a political independent when the Whig Party collapsed in the 1850s.\n\nJohn Bell won three states in the election—Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee—and lost Missouri by approximately a thousand votes. He took about a third of the vote in Alabama and North Carolina. Overall, some 40 percent of the voters in the slave states voted against secession. (In 1860, the electorate in the slave states, and the free states, consisted only of white men.) We have to remember that some three-fourths of the white Southern population did not own a single slave, so the expansion of slavery was not in their opinion worth seceding from the union.\n\nAfter Fort Sumter, a significant portion of the white Southern people opposed the war effort. These unionists undermined the Confederate war effort in a variety of ways, and some of them ended up in Southern prisons for speaking out against the government. When the Confederacy instituted a draft in 1862, there was widespread draft resistance, especially among working-class white Southerners. Approximately 100,000 white men from the South made the ultimate statement of loyalty and fought in the Union army. The Confederacy was so deeply divided that some historians believe that is the principal reason it lost the war.\n\nSo when white Southerners proclaim that the Confederate flag represents their history, they are misrepresenting their own history. Some of their ancestors opposed the war effort, and some of them fought for the United States flag. The myth of the united South is just that—a myth. Taking down the Confederate flag honors the unionists of the South, whose memory should also be preserved."}

{"text": "T\n\nhe call came in around 5 on a tepid January night in Gainesville, Florida. Officer Bobby White was patrolling an area nearby when he heard the complaint; kids were playing basketball too loudly in street. The officer on duty for that district was on another call, so White picked it up.\n\nVideo from White's dashboard camera shows him pull onto NW 21st Street, where a couple of teenage boys were shooting a basketball on a single hoop over the street.\n\nAs his patrol car came to a stop, the boys quit playing. White got out of his car and approached them.\n\nA scene as old and terrifying as the list of headlines that preceded it -- Trayvon Martin, Freddie Gray and others -- but what happened next did not befit the precedent.\n\n\"I knew how I wasn't going to react,\" White said. \"I knew I wasn't going to come here and make the kids stop playing basketball.\"\n\nThere was no confusion. No chaos. Just more basketball.\n\n\"Can you believe someone called in a noise complaint about kids playing basketball in the street?\" White asked as he approached 17-year-old Aahtrell Johnson.\n\nOfficer White quickly smiled -- \"Obviously, I ain't got no problem with it.\"\n\nThen he and the boys started playing together. It began small, with the two kids who were there when he originally pulled up. But as the minutes passed, more kept showing up.\n\nThere were the several from inside Tyree Thomas' house -- the hoop stood in his front yard. \"My friend came in and said the police was outside,\" Tyree explained, \"so we went outside to see what they did. Turns out they did nothing wrong.\"\n\nBy the time White left, there were eight kids playing. The whole event took about 10 minutes.\n\n\"Any time I have a chance, even when I'm not on active duty, to get out and interact with kids in the community, I do so,\" he said.\n\nA few days after the encounter, officer Ben Tobias, the public information officer for the Gainesville Police Department, posted White's dashboard camera footage online. Since then, it has received more than 17 million views on the department's Facebook page alone.\n\nOvernight, White became the \"Basketball Cop,\" and the hashtag #HoopsNotCrime began to trend.\n\nPeople also began donating basketballs and hoops. The Orlando Magic invited the group of boys to come to a basketball game and sent their bus to pick them up. Rock sporting apparel sent basketballs. The mayor of Gainesville invited them to his house. The Florida Gators gave them tickets to one of their games.\n\nThey've also had a few high-profile drop-ins. Shaquille O'Neal came to Gainesville after he heard the story and played basketball with the kids. The Harlem Globetrotters came to play and gave them game tickets.\n\n\"The response has been incredible,\" White said. He was even able to get a couple of local businesses to donate time and supplies to build a permanent basketball court in Tyree's backyard. The boys would no longer have to play in the street.\n\n\"I feel safe,\" Antwan Thompson said. \"Like this is my home.\"\n\nPolice video courtesy of Gainesville Police Department"}
{"text": "AIR FORCE ACADEMY, Colo. (AP) -- The first woman to lead the Air Force Academy says she faced resistance and sexual harassment in her career, but competence and confidence helped her push through the ranks to one of the top jobs in the service.\n\nLt. Gen. Michelle Johnson said in an interview Tuesday she isn't surprised that 32 years passed between her graduation from the academy in 1981 -- in the second class to include women -- and her appointment as its first female superintendent.\n\n\"It takes 32 years to make a lieutenant general,\" she said referring to the experience and training it takes to reach the three-star rank required for the superintendent's job.\n\nShe became superintendent on Aug. 12 at a time the military is under increasing pressure from Congress and the president to prevent sexual assaults.\n\nThe Pentagon estimated in May that up to 26,000 military members may have been sexually assaulted last year. A series of sexual assault scandals made clear how serious the problem is, including allegations of misconduct against officers who led sexual assault prevention programs and a commander overturning a sexual assault conviction.\n\nJohnson acknowledged she suffered sexual harassment but didn't provide specifics.\n\n\"It's not been a systematic thing,\" she said. Her response was along the lines of \"Knock it off,\" she said.\n\nJohnson brushed aside questions about whether the military as a whole is improving and whether changes proposed by Congress would help, but she said the academy is making progress.\n\nThe number of sexual assault victims at the academy who are willing to provide information to investigators and prosecutors has risen about 50 percent in the past six months, she said, although the overall numbers are small.\n\nAn academy spokesman said later that specific numbers on recent months weren't available yet.\n\nJohnson said the academy emphasizes caring for the victims of sexual assault and teaching cadets about the broad range of sexual violations, from harassment to violent assault.\n\n\"I think we're on to something here,\" she said.\n\nThe academy opened its doors to women in 1976, and Johnson enrolled the next year, in \"the bow wave of history,\" she said.\n\nShe became the school's first female Rhodes scholar and first female cadet wing commander. She played varsity basketball all four years at the academy and is the women's second-highest all-time scorer with 1,706 points.\n\nNot everyone was happy to see women as cadets, she said.\n\n\"When I showed up, it was about change, and not everybody is happy about change,\" she said.\n\nJohnson said she proved her worth at the controls of jet-powered C-141 cargo planes and KC-10 aerial fueling planes, and in her 20s, often commanded aircraft crews of men old enough to be her father.\n\n\"That opens a lot of doors,\" she said.\n\nCoast Guard Rear Adm. Sandra Stosz was the first woman to lead a U.S. military academy, becoming superintendent of the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Conn., in 2011.

Some days, she almost feels like she's got it, she's found all the missing pieces, and she's ready to find the places they go in, but they never quite fit. It's never long before she loses them again, before something breaks her concentration and it's all lost, all so many little meaningless words that don't fit or connect anywhere.\n\nShe clings to what she has anyway. The last time she thought she remembered something important, it was just a name, but it seemed the most important name she had ever heard, it seemed so important, like someone had screamed it three streets away and the wind had carried it here. She stole a scrap of parchment and a quill and wrote it down. She hadn't held a quill in so long that it shook, and her handwriting was large and messy, like a child's. It was just five letters:\n\nHarry.\n\nAnd then, later, when she remembered something else, another five letters, strung together, it seems, almost by chance:\n\nJames.\n\nMost of the time they don't mean anything. But sometimes, when she is alone in her room-no matter how full of flowers it is, no matter how beautiful and constantly in bloom they are-she pulls the bit of parchment out from the slit in the seam of her dress and reads the names. Mouths them. Memorizes them. And something tugs deep down inside her, and she finds her face wet, and she knows that she has done something wrong, something very bad and wrong, but she can't remember what. She rolls up the parchment tight and hides it in the lining of her shoes, to be discovered again and again and memorized again and again, and-\n\nThere are footsteps. He's coming. She scrubs her face and sleeve on her robes and tries to look bright and cheerful-he hates to see her sad-and she finishes the bouquet she is arranging on the dining room table.\n\nThe front door opens. It is storming outside, and the wind is ghastly. \"Lily?\"\n\n\"In here,\" she says. The cold air is already creeping around her bare feet, but she hears the door shut and lock, and footsteps. He fills the doorway like a spider fills a corner, suddenly, almost all web and no weight to him, shaking snow from his cloak. He pushes his hood back and shrugs the thing off. She takes it from him. Snowflakes melt into her palms like the tiniest, newest ocean.\n\nHis hand on her shoulder is cold from outside, and it's shocking that anyone can feel so cold and still be alive. It makes her start. But he's her best friend, she chides herself, and he's so gentle with her, and he takes care of her ever since-\n\nHis lips are so cold on her forehead that she might be being kissed by a corpse. But it feels good to have him home.\n\nHome. Harry. James. Like thinking in another language, one she learned as a child and hadn't spoken in years.\n\nShe shakes her head again, and smiles up brightly. \"How was your day, Sev?\""}

{"text": "By Patricia Maresch, Contributing Reporter\n\nRIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL – While a caipirinha is more likely to spring to mind when thinking of a Brazilian drink, do not rule out a glass of Brazilian produced wine, especially a sparkling one. Wine importers around the world are discovering Brazilian wines and exports from Brazil are rising rapidly, with sales of sparkling wines achieving a 12 percent growth in 2010.\n\nAccording to a survey by the Brazilian Wine Institute Ibravin (Instituto Brasileiro do Vinho), in 2010 12.5 million liters of sparkling wine was sold, compared to 11.1 million gallons placed in 2009.\n\n\"We have never sold so many sparkling wines,\" says Ibravin chairman Julius Fante. Exports in 2010 have gone mainly to neighboring Paraguay and Russia, with England, the United States and Japan as runners up. Ireland, Hong Kong and China have recently opened up their markets for Brazilian wine as well.\n\nOf all the Brazilian wine producers, the house of Miolo saw the biggest growth in 2010. The company reported a 17 percent increase in total exports, 20 percent growth in average price, in addition to opening new markets.\n\nMiolo alone grossed US$1.2 million, exporting to 24 destinations across three continents. The international success of Brazilian wines can be attributed to the quality of the wines as well as new market strategies.\n\nBrazil is a very geographically diverse country with several major vineyard areas. The principal wine-growing region is the state of Rio Grande do Sul. The Serra Gaucha has more than 90,000 acres planted to vine, where winegrowers produce crops twice a year.\n\nThe Portuguese Jesuit priests established vineyards in Rio Grande do Sul in the Seventeenth century, but it took the knowledge of wine-making from Italian immigrants in the late Nineteenth century to really develop a Brazilian wine.\n\nTheir influence on Brazilian Spumante and Prosecco wines continues today. Brazilian sparkling wines receive international acclaim for being fruity, sophisticated and with a perfume that indulges ones palate.\n\nThe growing export numbers are also enhanced by successfully introducing Brazilian wine at international events and fairs and getting the wine on the market in bars, restaurants and hotels. Miolo also launched a wine produced especially for the export market.\n\n\"Sales in England rose by over 200 percent with this wine. It was very well received and appreciated by the English,\" says a spokesperson at Miolo.\n\nLast year the overall Brazilian wine export to the Netherlands grew by 150 percent due to a highly successful wine tasting mission in partnership with the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nBrazil is the fifth largest producer of wines in the southern hemisphere, only beaten by Argentina, Australia, South Africa and Chile. Although average wine consumption in Brazil is low – less than two liters per capita – Brazil's middle class is on the rise which attributes to the rise of the wine market.\n\nIt is calculated that Brazil's wine market is still emerging with a wine drinking population of 20.8 million. They also expect Brazil to become a more prominent player in the world of wine. However, new players in the Brazilian wine market should take into account that Brazil's foreign tax policy is still changing and evolving, which could greatly impact the wine import business for 2011."}

{"text": "Millions more homes should have solar panels on their roofs, the new energy secretary has suggested, vowing to \"unleash a new solar revolution\" across Britain.\n\nAmber Rudd, the former climate change minister, was promoted to lead the energy department in this week's reshuffle, in a move that was welcomed by many green groups .\n\nMs Rudd indicated she would back the continued expansion of household solar panels , which are heavily subsidised by consumers through levies on energy bills.\n\n\"I want to unleash a new solar revolution - we have a million people living under roofs with solar panels and that number needs to increase,\" she told her local newspaper, the Hastings & St Leonards Observer .\n\nThe Coalition government introduced a generous subsidy scheme to encourage households to install solar panels, triggering a boom that far exceeded ministers' expectations and saw them embroiled in a High Court battle over attempts to rein in the payments.\n\nIn total about 640,000 homes now have panels installed. The annual cost of the scheme is now estimated to be in excess of £800 million a year - almost twice the level ministers originally anticipated, as a result of the early boom.\n\nCritics say the scheme enables wealthy families to rake in subsidies paid for by many who are already struggling with their energy bills.\n\nAmber Rudd MP becomes Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change @DECCgovuk #reshuffle #Ministers2015 pic.twitter.com/uNdJITxUND — UK Prime Minister (@Number10gov) May 11, 2015\n\nWhile the payments are less generous than they once were, a household can still expect to make thousands of pounds in profit by installing panels.\n\nA typical solar panel installation of 16 panels on a large family home could cost in the region of £6,000 but an owner could expect to recoup that cash within 7 to 8 years and thereafter make profit, according to the Solar Trade Association.\n\nSolar panels being installed on a roof\n\nThe homeowner is paid for every unit of electricity the panels generate – while also saving on cash by not having to buy energy from a supplier. If the panels produce more power than the home needs, the owner can get paid for selling it on to the National Grid.\n\nAside from solar, Ms Rudd told the newspaper that she wanted to \"shout loud about the benefits of switching energy tariffs\" and to improve home insulation.\n\n\"My ambition in my new role is quite simple: to keep the lights on and carbon emissions down, whilst saving consumers money on their energy bills,\" she said.\n\nAmong the key priorities for Ms Rudd will be implementing the Conservatives' manifesto pledge to \"halt the spread of onshore windfarms\" by ending subsidies for new projects, and awarding energy companies new exploration rights to frack to shale gas.\n\nBoris Johnson, the Mayor of London, said the new Conservative government would \"certainly\" be the \"greenest ever\" – five years to the day since David Cameron pledged that of the Coalition.\n\nHe told BusinessGreen that \"huskies are go\", in a reference to Mr Cameron posing with huskies in 2006 on a Norwegian glacier as part of efforts to show the party cared about tackling global warming.

{"text": "A veteran unionist figure has said that if Ireland was reunited by a narrow margin in a border poll then it would spark \"civil war\".\n\nLord Kilclooney, a former top UUP MP who now sits as a cross-bench peer in the House of Lords, was speaking to the News Letter after the taoiseach declared that he would not want Irish reunification to come about as a result of a mere 51%-to-49% margin.\n\nLeo Varadkar dismissed the prospect of a united Ireland without significant majority support in Northern Ireland\n\nThe taoiseach's words – drawn from an interview on BBC Spotlight last night, and circulated publicly before broadcast – stirred a strong reaction from both the SDLP and Sinn Fein, who said his stance ran counter to the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nMr Varadkar said: \"I wouldn't like us to get to the point whereby we are changing the constitutional position here in Northern Ireland on a 50%-plus-one basis.\n\n\"One of the best things about the Good Friday Agreement is that it did get very strong cross-border support – that's why there was a 70% vote for it. I don't think that there would be a 70 % vote for a united Ireland in the morning, for example, or anything remotely to that.\"\n\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood declared in a statement that the \"principle of consent in the Good Friday Agreement cannot be undone\".\n\nWhilst he said he rejected the \"numbers game\", he concluded that the Good Friday Agreement \"provides that a simple majority is the mechanism\" for a united Ireland.\n\nSinn Fein MLA Conor Murphy said \"the overwhelming majority of people on this island support Irish reunification\".\n\nHe added: \"If a simple majority vote in favour of reunification, both governments are then obliged to legislate for it. The Good Friday Agreement is the legal and internationally binding position.\"\n\nIn a 2015 interview, published in the News Letter, Lord Trimble – one of the key architects of the Good Friday Agreement – said he \"knew that we needed over 70% [of voters to back the agreement] to be certain that we had a majority of unionists behind us... if we had fallen short of that we would have been in an enormously difficult situation\".\n\nYesterday, Lord Kilclooney told the News Letter that polls do not show anything like 50% support for a united Ireland in the Province, so \"to talk about more than 50% is of course, in my opinion, absolutely crazy\".\n\nHe said the bulk of the Catholic community vote for nationalist parties for \"reasons of community division and not because they actually want a united Ireland\".\n\nHe added: \"Assuming we were wrong on this, and there was a 50.1% in favour of a united Ireland, in no way would one dare have a united Ireland.\n\n\"Because the reality on the ground in Northern Ireland is there would be civil war.\n\n\"You cannot force Northern Ireland out of the UK by a 1% majority.

{"text": "Laser rangefinders are excellent tools that help you to determine longer distances that wouldn't be practical or possible to measure by hand. Since their inception, these gadgets have been improved and modified to become serious pieces of equipment. Their scope of use extends far beyond standard construction or labor contexts however.\n\nLaser rangefinders are also a great asset to use when mountaineering or hunting, along with other outdoor activities. www.bestrangefinderreviewsguide.com is a great resource for determining which rangefinder is best suited for your needs.\n\nWithout having access to a laser rangefinder when mountaineering, it is simply impossible to measure the distance up a mountain unless you hike it! But in order to gather the necessary information you need on a hike, a quality laser rangefinder can help you figure out the distance to your next location. This not only provides climbers with an understanding of distances, but it also helps to increase safety by providing accurate and reliable information from which climbers can use to make important decisions, especially on more dangerous and technical routes.\n\nAnother great feature of laser rangefinders are their compatibility. When you're out climbing mountains, the last thing you need is more stuff weighing you down. A majority of laser rangefinders are designed to fit inside your bag with no problem. Depending on your preference, rangefinders for mountaineering can also be handheld or come with a tripod for added stability.\n\nHunting is all about precision and accuracy. Make any small mistake and that opportunity you had can disappear in seconds. That is why hunters strive to remove all of the unpredictable or unknown variables that they can, ensuring the best chance of making the shot. That is why rangefinders are becoming more in more popular in the hunting world. Rangefinders can provide hunters with the exact distances between them and their targets.\n\nThis takes a lot of guesswork and estimating out of the equation which highly increases the chances of a successful shot. There are rangefinders that can be found designed for the sole purpose of hunting. Some models are designed for hand-held usage, while others include mounts or poles. Still, some other models mount directly onto your hunting weapon of choice, whether that be a bow, rifle and more.\n\nSome of the major manufacturers of laser rangefinders include Bushnell, Luepold, hunting giant Cabela, and even some camera manufacturers such as Nikon and Canon produce their own quality laser rangefinders. Depending on the laser rangefinder itself and the manufacturer, their specificity of use may differ. For those wanting to use a rangefinder for only hunting, it would be wise to purchase one from a company who specializes in this field. The same goes for those looking for laser rangefinders for the sole purpose of mountaineering. In effect, all laser rangefinders accomplish the same task, but some added features can specialize it to the user's particular needs.\n\nWhether you are climbing a mountain or heading out for a weekend of hunting, guessing distances won't help you succeed. Take away all of the doubts and guessing by utilizing a laser rangefinder. The sheer accuracy of these tools will make sure that all of the unknown variables are removed. If you're climbing a mountain, you no longer have to worry if your estimates are correct. For those of you hunting, you can remain confident that one shot is going to count."}

The company had to hold off selling the division for tax reasons.\n\nMotorola Mobility's performance has yet to live up to its purchase price. Since Motorola split and its consumer division went to Google, it has been a constant source of red ink. Motorola lost quite a lot of money: $248 million in the last quarter alone. Google sums this well, noting that the loss was \"-21% of Motorola Mobile segment revenues.\" Motorola lost $192 million in the year-ago quarter, so the trend here isn't positive.\n\nGoogle previously sold off the cable box division of Motorola Mobility for $2.4 billion.\n\nThis comes just weeks after Google purchased the hot hardware startup Nest. Since then, Nest's role in the budding conglomerate that Google is turning into has been widely speculated about. With Motorola gone, Nest's superstar team that includes many former Apple engineers seemingly has an empty playground.\n\nIt seems this complete's Lenovo's quest for an established cell phone business. It was rumored back in October that the company submitted a bid for BlackBerry. That deal clearly didn't pan out.\n\nSimply buying its way to the top worked for Lenovo in the past. In 2005 Lenovo purchased IBM's personal computer division for $1.25 billion. That purchase alone caused Lenovo to be the world's third-largest computer maker. But, using the established brand, Lenovo scaled the PC division to become the largest shipper of PCs in the world. In the last months of 2013 Lenovo overtook HP.\n\nJust last week, Lenovo announced a plan to buy IBM's x86 server business for $2.3 billion.\n\nAs the dust settles on this deal, it's clear that Google took a large loss on its venture with Motorola Mobility. Google acquired an established brand with a vast portfolio of patents, a mature distribution system and a knowledgeable manufacturing arm. Even after pouring money and resources into the historic American brand, Google couldn't make lemonade with Motorola. Maybe Lenovo, the now-leader in personal computers, will have better luck.\n\nMore as we get it."}

{"text": "Ever since Microsoft announced their Bridge technologies at Build 2015 questions about how they work (and how well) have been asked. The tools let developers port over Android apps (Project Astoria), iOS apps (Project Islandwood), web apps (Project Westminster) and classic Win32 apps (Project Centennial) to Windows 10 including phone. This morning, the actual tools for Project Astoria have leaked onto the web and users can freely (and illegally) download Android APKs and sideload them to their Windows Phone running Windows 10 Mobile. This follows yesterday's leak of the documentation for the project. As it turns out, the tools are very powerful with the only limitation being the inability to run Google Play apps, which is in many ways trivial (this also means Snapchat will not work). Indeed, Windows Central has learned these tools are far from final and that the upcoming TH2 release has many more improvements, promising a much better user experience. Microsoft going all out courting iOS and Android developers for Windows 10 Windows Central is not linking to the file nor providing instructions on how to sideload. Simply put, the software is not finished, and the ability to steal Android apps is not something we would like to promote. We also don't need the traffic. Obviously, this situation is unique and Windows Central is caught between reporting on this and aiding and abetting it.\n\nDeveloper Concerns The idea that developers can simply and directly convert an Android APK to a Windows 10 APPX is both fascinating and a bit disturbing for developers. Here is why: Android developers – Their apps can now \"easily\" be downloaded and installed on Windows Phone, often without paying or abiding by the software's EULA. Of course, this not new, as this situation has always existed for Android developers. Windows Phone developers – This situation, however, is unique. Windows Central has already spoken to a few developers who are distraught about how easy it is to port. Indeed, a few of them feel burned and are ready to give up on native Windows Phone app development because why bother? Certainly Project Astoria is controversial. On the one hand, why should developers now make Windows Phone apps when they can just do Android and port it over? The alternative argument, of course, is that developers want to write a native Windows 10 app so that it can run on the phone, PC and other Microsoft technologies. These are places where Android apps cannot go even as a port. Once again, this is a chicken and egg situation for Microsoft. If developers port over their Android apps to Windows Phone, Windows 10 Mobile's market share can grow. If it grows, developers can re-write their apps for all of Windows 10 to target an even larger market. Then again, developers may port Android apps (or not) and Windows Phone native app development languishes and goes nowhere.\n\nFor Windows Phone users Putting aside the developer situation, which at best is now very unstable, what about consumers? Assuming developers bother to port their apps – something that remains to be seen – certainly those using a Windows Phone could see a big boost in available apps and games from these Bridge tools. Boosting apps and games in the Store, after all, is the point of the projects. The Android apps are not just run in-situ but can plug into various components of Windows 10 including notifications and Live Tiles. These are the 'bridges' to native functions that Microsoft refers to in the documentation."}
{"text": "MUZAFFARPUR: There is many a slip between a cup and the lip. This proverb holds true of Shahi litchi crop in Muzaffarpur district this year. The crop, which was developing in a normal way till a month back due to favourable weather conditions, has been damaged upto 40% in general due to abnormal rise in temperature, hot westerly wind, total absence of rain and sharp fall in humidity just 20 days prior to its harvesting.Fruit harvesting has been delayed by a week and if the growers wait for another three to five days more, it might assume the normal reddish colour and its pulp may gain more weight because of the easterly wind which has started blowing since Saturday morning. This is for the first time in the last 15 years that no rainfall has been recorded in the district in May so far.While moving in Jhapaha orchard of Bholanath Jha on Saturday morning, the principal scientist of National Litchi Research Centre, Muzaffarpur, S K Purve said 40% of crop has been burnt by heat wave in Bochaha-Mushahari belt as the absentee orchard owners could not adopt proper safety measures to save their crops from excessive heat. On the other hand, he was satisfied to see bunches of normal sized litchi resting on the ground. This, he said, was only because of the constant care taken by Jha to save the fruit. He said in such orchards, one quintal of litchi is possible from each tree. Adopting scientific methods for the growth of the crop never goes unrewarded, Purve remarked.Litchi grower Jha, who had received the award of 'Udyan Ratna' from the state government a few years back, said farmers have to grow high-rise creepers around the orchard or cover it with other dense leafy trees particularly on the western side to protect this hot-weather fruit from excessive heat. Efforts to keep the orchard cool as far as possible helps the fruit in getting normal size, sweetness, aroma and colour.Jha said the abnormal rise in temperature has affected the size of the fruit this year, in general. Weight of each piece is only 14 to 15 grams whereas it should have been 20 to 25 gm. Litchi has the capacity to tolerate the temperature up to 38 degree but has crossed 40 degree in the last 15 days. The minimum humidity the fruit can sustain is 50, but it fell down to 17 to 20% during the pre-harvest period. That is why the traders of Mumbai have rejected the first consignment of litchi and have asked the growers to wait for five days more.Plucking of litchi has started in most of the orchards. It is being sold at Rs 100 per 100 piece in the local market whereas it was only Rs 60 last year. 'China' variety is expected to give good return to the growers and traders but it does not have the aroma of Shahi variety. 'China' variety's harvesting is expected after a week. The litchi season will come to an end by June 15.The NLRC is trying to extend this season up to July end but it might take another five years. Experiments with breeds from China and Thailand are going on for the last couple of years, NLRC scientists informed."}
{"text": "SANTA CRUZ >> UC Santa Cruz has agreed to the demands of the Afrikan Black Student Alliance after a three-day occupation of Kerr Hall, the primary administration building on campus.\n\nTo loud cheers of victory, UCSC director of News and Media Relations Scott Hernandez-Jason stood before hundreds of students at Kerr Hall about 5:30 p.m. Thursday and announced that the university was committed to better serving its African, black and Caribbean-identified students.\n\nTo illustrate this, UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal agreed to the Alliance's demands and made the following commitments:\n\n• UCSC committed to extending up to a four-year housing guarantee to all students from underrepresented communities who applied to and live in the Rosa Parks African American Theme House.\n\n• UCSC committed to converting the first floor lounge area of the Rosa Parks African American Theme House from housing back to a community lounge space.\n\n• USCS committed to painting the exterior of the Rosa Parks African American Theme House in the Pan-Afrikan colors red, gold and green.\n\n• USCS committed to delivering a mandatory \"educational diversity\" orientation to all incoming freshmen and transfer students.\n\nTwo hours earlier, an agreement that would end the three-day occupation did not seem likely. About 3:30 p.m., members of the Alliance leadership announced through a bullhorn that Blumenthal had declined to meet at Kerr Hall, citing concerns for his safety.\n\nInstead, Blumenthal sent members of his administration, including campus diversity officer Linda Scholz, to speak with the students at the entrance of Kerr Hall. Surrounded by hundreds of chanting, screaming students, Scholz invited the leadership group of the Alliance to speak with Blumenthal in the nearby Thimann Labs building.\n\nIt initially appeared as if the Alliance would decline to speak with Blumenthal and, instead, insist the chancellor meet on their terms. However, the leadership group eventually accompanied the administrators to Thimann Labs.\n\nAfter more than an hour in conference, the Alliance leadership and Hernandez-Jason returned to Kerr Hall to announce the university's decision and allow the students to celebrate their victory.\n\nHernandez-Jason said he assumed this agreement meant that Kerr Hall would now be vacated by the students, although he did not appear to have a written agreement from the Alliance.\n\nThe protest, which made national news, has not been without its controversies. The Alliance refused to speak to local media, verbally harassing and threatening to press unspecified charges against the Sentinel for covering the occupation. However, it did grant an interview to Tucker Carlson of Fox News.\n\nThe Alliance said local media was \"trespassing\" on property they had \"reclaimed.\"\n\nIn addition, during the rally that preceded the occupation of Kerr Hall on Tuesday at Quarry Plaza, members of the Afrikan Black Student Alliance verbally attacked Jewish students, according to Santa Cruz Hillel Director Sarah Cohen Domont.\n\n\"Our students were, on three separate instances, subjected to protesters yelling, (expletives and anti-Semitic insults) and one of our Israeli flags was torn down,\" wrote Cohen Domont in a public statement. \"The ABSA called for protesters to stand in solidarity with their Palestinian brothers and sisters.\"\n\nTuesday was Israel Independence Day. Santa Cruz Hillel and its \"pro-Israel partners\" had gathered in Quarry Plaza to celebrate."}
{"text": "Asylum seekers, foreign workers and tourists without valid visas being held in Israeli detention centers suffer from overcrowding, inadequate food and a lack of translators, health care and access to legal representation, a report by a refugee rights group charges.\n\nThe report, by the Hotline for Refugees and Migrants, is based mainly on interviews with 72 detainees. It covers the Saharonim and Givon prisons, the open detention facility at Holot and the Yahalom lockup, where illegal entrants facing deportation are held. Altogether, these facilities hold some 5,000 people, including asylum seekers from Eritrea and Sudan and foreign workers or tourists without valid visas.\n\nThe report charged that overcrowding at these facilities violates the law. At Saharonim, for instance, interviewees said there were 10 detainees per cell, double the capacity in the prison's master plan. Moreover, each person has only 2.2 square meters of space, about half the amount required by Israel Prison Service regulations and a quarter of the norm in other Western countries.\n\nAt Holot, there were also 10 people per room, but there, the amount of space per person meets Prison Service standards. At Givon, occupancy ranged from six to 16 people per room, while at Yahalom, several families sometimes shared a single room.\n\nFresh air was also an issue. At Saharonim, detainees can leave their rooms between 6 A.M. and 10 P.M., but the only outdoor area they can use is an interior courtyard where they can't even see the sun. At Givon, detainees said they were allowed to spend one to five hours a day in the courtyard, depending on the wardens' availability. Yahalom has no common area where detainees can gather.\n\nKeep updated: Sign up to our newsletter Email * Please enter a valid email address Sign up Please wait… Thank you for signing up.

Close\n\nSome detainees at Saharonim and Givon said they didn't receive needed medical care, and most were unaware that social workers and mental health services were available. At Holot, most of those who visited the medical clinic deemed the care inadequate.\n\nMany detainees complained about the quantity and quality of food, especially at Holot. Many also said they lacked adequate clothing for all seasons, as well as hygiene products like soap, shampoo and toothpaste.\n\nAll the facilities had a shortage of translators. At Saharonim, for instance, only three of the 26 interviewees reported having a translator during medical checkups, and at Holot most detainees reported a similar absence of translators at the clinic.\n\nMany detainees said they lacked legal representation at on-site hearings, since only minors and trafficking victims are entitled to state-funded lawyers. The hotline, which is the only organization allowed to enter the facilities, provides legal services to about 20 percent of detainees, but in recent years the Prison Service has limited its access, the report said.\n\nThe Prison Service termed the report a \"tendentious recycling of claims that were raised and refuted in the past. The report doesn't reflect the reality at detention facilities, and beyond that, we don't intend to comment.\""}

And by family, I mean me and over 70 of my relatives.\n\nA hundred years ago today, at the height of the Armenian Genocide, many of my great-grandparents and their parents lost their lives. Ever since then, Armenians have spread all over the world, and Armenia itself is now a small, landlocked third world country. Part of my goal with this blog is to preserve and hopefully immortalize part of my culture – the food.\n\nFood is a huge part of any culture, and that's especially true for us Middle Easterners. We love our spices, flavors, and herbs. Every dish is made from a recipe that has been passed down. You'd be hard-pressed to find one that doesn't require a trip to a Middle Eastern market, but it's always worth it.\n\nMy next step, other than adding more Armenian recipes here from time to time, is to document my family's history with audio recordings.

{"text": "FCC Proposal Would Limit What Internet Providers Can Do With Users' Data\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP\n\nThe FCC has unveiled a proposal that would restrict Internet providers' ability to share the information they collect about what their customers do online with advertisers and other third parties.\n\nIf adopted, these would be the first privacy rules for Internet service providers, resulting largely from last year's net neutrality regulations that expanded the Federal Communications Commission's oversight authority over the industry. (Those rules are currently pending in court.)\n\nThursday's unveiling of the proposal from Chairman Tom Wheeler is just a first step: The FCC is expected to vote to formally propose this plan on March 31, soliciting public comments on a variety of questions about how the rules should work before the final version gets drafted.\n\nThe key elements of Wheeler's proposal include a requirement that broadband providers such as Comcast, Verizon or T-Mobile clearly disclose what data they collect on you — for instance, it could be browsing history, use of apps or location — and how they shared that collected data with other companies for marketing or other purposes.\n\nIn some instances, subscribers would be asked to opt in or they'd be given a choice to opt out, depending on how the information is used. (Re/code has a helpful breakdown of the details.) The proposal also has provisions for better security of the information traveling through ISPs' networks.\n\nWheeler wrote in a Huffington Post op-ed that ISPs should be held to the same privacy standard as telephone companies:\n\n\"Your ISP handles all of your network traffic. That means it has a broad view of all of your unencrypted online activity — when you are online, the websites you visit, and the apps you use. If you have a mobile device, your provider can track your physical location throughout the day in real time. Even when data is encrypted, your broadband provider can piece together significant amounts of information about you — including private information such as a chronic medical condition or financial problems — based on your online activity. \"The information collected by the phone company about your telephone usage has long been protected information. Regulations of the (FCC) limit your phone company's ability to repurpose and resell what it learns about your phone activity. \"The same should be true for information collected by your ISP.\"\n\nTelecom companies are resisting the FCC's push to regulate their privacy practices, arguing that this puts them on unequal footing compared with websites and web services such as Google that also collect a lot of information about people's digital tracks. As The New York Times points out, those companies are overseen by another agency:\n\n\"The regulations, if approved, would put broadband providers under stronger privacy oversight than Internet companies like Google and Facebook. Those companies are monitored by the Federal Trade Commission, whose ability to create specific privacy rules is limited. \"Many privacy advocates have pushed for a greater role by other agencies because the F.T.C. cannot create rules for online privacy and can only monitor data collection practices as an enforcement agency.\"\n\nAT&T's Bob Quinn, senior vice president of federal regulatory affairs, said in a blog post this week that Internet providers \"do not currently live in a 'regulatory-free zone' when it comes to privacy,\" but one guided by the FTC's regime, which prohibits deceptive and unfair trade practices:"}
{"text": "As an undergraduate, I took a course titled \"The Logic of Chess.\" I was a relative newcomer to the game; I knew how to play, but wasn't any good. One of my classmates, a USCF-rated player, was clearly taking the course for the pure love of the game, and perhaps for an easy math credit. He once asked me, \"Do you want to improve your rating significantly in just a week?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" I answered.\n\n\"Then take a copy of Chess Life, find a transcription of a game between two Grandmasters, and memorize every move.\"\n\nThat evening, I began applying his advice. Sure enough, my game improved within days. I might not have understood every move to its fullest, but by studying an annotated transcript of a game I felt one step closer to thinking like a grandmaster. If you've ever taken a foreign language, say French, you might have learned that it doesn't just pay to know French, you've got to think in French. When you bypass the translation routine in your head, your fluency improves dramatically. In Music, as in Chess and Language, to express yourself as a master you must learn to think like one. This is why we transcribe.\n\nTranscription is the act of deciphering, note-for-note, what occurs in a piece of music. Most of the great musicians we admire transcribed music played by the greats before them. Sonny Rollins studied Coleman Hawkins, Eddie Van Halen studied Eric Clapton, Pat Metheny studied Wes Montgomery. For every great musician, there are a number of others that inspired him. Do not confuse inspiration with mere impression. If you admire an artist because he impresses you, that may be enough to motivate you to pick up the instrument and play in the first place, and that's important; but your path to mastery is paved by periods of inspiration, during which you are actually inspired to study an artist's work very closely. Many guitarists mistakenly cite artists that impress them as influences, when the list of artists that have actually inspired them is much shorter. When an artist inspires you, a fitting response is to transcribe some of his work.\n\nSome guitarists will claim that learning other people's solos will only make you sound like other people, and hinder you from developing your own unique style. If you believe that, you doom yourself to mediocrity. No one ever developed a unique style without first being familiar with other styles. The process of learning to be a musician involves first building a foundation of basic proficiency, then basing any personal innovation on that foundation.\n\nThe ability to listen to music and either transcribe it on paper or perform it enhances all other creative musical skills. If you can hear a phrase and play it back, you are better equipped to write or improvise original music. You possess an internal ear that ought to know how something sounds before it's played. Whereas listeners first hear, then process, musicians process, then play. In other words, just as subtraction is merely addition with one sign reversed, transcription is performance reversed in time. It is an act of reverse engineering; in transcribing, you place yourself in the head of the original performer. You learn how a master thinks.\n\nIn my next post, I will describe the three methods for learning solos, and their inherent pros and cons."}
{"text": "Several major civil-rights organizations, including the NAACP and the ACLU, are expressing outrage that President-elect Donald Trump has picked Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions to be the next attorney general of the United States.\n\nA statement from the NAACP Legal Defense Fund blasted Sessions' \"decades-long record—from his early days as a prosecutor to his present role as a senator—of opposing civil rights and equality.\" President and Director-Counsel Sherrilyn Ifill wrote, \"It is unimaginable that he could be entrusted to serve as the chief law-enforcement officer for this nation's civil-rights laws. This is yet another signal from the incoming administration that it is not only prepared to turn its back on equality; it is actively working to continue to sow division and undo decades of progress.\"\n\nThe selection followed a meeting between Trump and Sessions on Wednesday, in which Trump said he was \"unbelievably impressed\" with Sessions. The senator, to say the least, is a controversial choice to run the Justice Department, as he has been publicly accused of racially charged comments and actions as far back as the 1980s.\n\n\"The last person women and families need in this job is someone who has repeatedly given a pass to individuals who commit acts of violence against abortion clinics, doesn't take sexual assault seriously, and was determined to be too racist by a GOP-led Senate to become a federal judge,\" NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue said in a statement Friday. \"But that's who Jeff Sessions is. His record of misogyny and racism makes him unfit to be the country's top lawyer. The American people deserve far better, but with Donald Trump at the helm, we know we won't get it.\"\n\nHogue specifically blasted Sessions' \"long anti-choice record,\" as well as his defense of Trump's notorious \"grab them by the pussy\" moment.\n\nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero chimed in Friday with his own statement about Trump's choice. \"As a matter of organizational policy, the American Civil Liberties Union does not take a position supporting or opposing presidential or judicial nominations,\" the statement read.\n\n\"We do, however, educate the American people and the Congress about nominees' records and past positions.\" Sessions has, Romero said, \"called the ACLU un-American and communist, assertions we flatly reject.\" Romero continued, \"His positions on LGBT rights, capital punishment, abortion rights, and presidential authority in times of war have been contested by the ACLU and other civil-rights organizations. As the nation's highest-ranking law enforcement official, the attorney general is charged with protecting the rights of all Americans.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Luis V. Gutiérrez, of Illinois, issued his own passionate denouncement that caught wind on Twitter. \"If you have nostalgia for the days when blacks kept quiet, gays were in the closet, immigrants were invisible and women stayed in the kitchen, Senator Jefferson Beauregard Sessions is your man,\" he wrote.\n\n\"No senator has fought harder against the hopes and aspirations of Latinos, immigrants, and people of color than Sen.

{"text": "You're familiar with Amazon.com's recommendation feature: \"People who bought this book, also bought these books.\"\n\nAggregate Knowledge is a Menlo Park start-up offering such a recommendation service on a mass scale — to any Web site. But it does Amazon one-better by watching consumer reading patterns online, and giving recommendation feedback immediately. (Amazon updates its recommendations once a month)\n\nBy all accounts, AK is doing very well. It started in April, and is already making $2 million in annualized revenue, according to chief exec Paul Martino. Tomorrow, it will announce it has won $5 million from Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. First Round Capital and others invested $500,000 in an earlier seed round. It employs 21 people, up from three in April. Recommendations are hotter than many people realize. Amazon says 35 percent of product sales result from recommendations. Martino, formerly at Tribe, said he noticed the power of recommendations while working at his previous company, Tribe — and thus his decision to launch AK.\n\nWe last wrote about AK here\n\nOverstock.com is one of several sites that have implemented it. Shoppers of a gift basket (see image below), will see items that previous readers have gone on to view after viewing that item — saving users time, and helping them get to their likely destination quicker — since AK knows what previous readers ended up viewing.\n\nIn his earnings call last month, Overstock's chief executive Patrick Byrne says integration with AK was easy, and that it's providing a \"nice, measurable lift\" despite being up only a few weeks.\n\nAK offers the service for news sites, too: It links to articles that previous readers of the same article went on to read. It also helps find more relevant ads, tracking which ads are popular based on the behavior of past viewers. This is where AK hopes to beat Google. Take, for example, a reader of Fox Sports, who learns their team going to the Super Bowl. Google might offer an ad for ticket merchant RazorGator. However, AK would skip RazorGator altogether and offer a way to buy Super Bowl tickets directly. In other words, it will offer an ad, a product, or a service – depending on what the reader is most likely to want, based on previous behavior. AK tracks click streams during sessions on a Web site; it does so anonymously, aggregating data so it knows what readers are most likely to do.\n\nAK gets paid based on performance. If the customer is a news site, AK gets paid for increasing page views. If the customer is a product site, AK gets paid if it sells more products.\n\nAK takes several days to customize its product for sites. By first quarter next year, Martino tells us, he wants to make it plug and play. VentureBeat, for example, could get a widget that allows its readers to see what other readers have also read. Sphere does something similar now. See the \"Sphere it\" button at the top of this article. If you click it, you'll see mostly other blog related material. However, Sphere's recommendations are based on related sites and content, not necessary on where people have actually gone.\n\nAK's competitors include Boston's ChoiceStream. Its software reportedly takes longer to deploy. Loomia, of San Francisco, is another player."}

{"text": "Image caption Female drivers will soon face increased premiums, says the AA\n\nCar insurance premiums fell in the third quarter of the year, according to a regular survey by the AA motoring organisation.\n\nAfter several years of big increases, premiums were flat in the first half of the year and have now started dropping.\n\nThe cheapest comprehensive policies bought directly from insurers fell by 2.9% to £870 a year.\n\nPolicies bought via price comparison web sites also fell, by 1% to an average £612.\n\nThis meant that directly purchased policies were still 6% more expensive than a year ago, while those bought from price comparison sites had become slightly cheaper in that time.\n\nSimon Douglas of AA Insurance said stiff competition for business was putting pressure on premiums, despite the fact that the cost of claims was still rising.\n\n\"Competition is tough in the insurance market, forcing many companies to reduce premiums despite the fact that costs show little sign of abating,\" he said.\n\nNew rules\n\nThe motor insurance industry will go through two big changes in the next few months.\n\nFrom 21 December 2012, insurers will no longer be allowed to offer cheaper premiums to female drivers, following a ruling from the European Court of Justice.\n\nIn March last year, the ECJ ruled that it was no longer legal for insurers to charge different prices depending on gender.\n\nThis will also affect the cost of buying an annuity.\n\nInsurers have warned that female drivers, particularly young ones, will probably see their premiums rise by 25% to bring them into line with men.\n\nSome in the industry even suggested that women's premiums may rise by more, possibly as much as 50%, and that some firms may stop offering insurance to all young drivers altogether.\n\nSeparately, from April 2013 the law will be changed to ban a practice which has helped drive up motor premiums in the past decade.\n\nThe insurance industry's widespread acceptance of referral fees, to sell information about accident victims to claims management firms or to no-win, no-fee, law firms, will be made unlawful in personal injury claims.\n\nAlso, anyone suing for accident damages with the help of a no-win, no-fee lawyer - known as a conditional fee arrangement - will in future have to pay their lawyer's success fee from their own funds if they win their case and not add it to the bill of the losing party.\n\nThis will make claims more expensive to pursue.\n\nMeanwhile, the government intends to consult on ways to cut the number and costs of so-called \"whiplash\" claims which come to court.\n\nInsurers have identified these as one of the main causes of the rapidly rising cost of motor insurance, arguing that in many cases, the claims are fraudulent or too difficult to contest under the present rules.\n\nChanges might include raising the small claims limit for personal injury cases from £1,000 to £5,000, so that more claims are dealt with cheaply in the county courts, and also bringing in independent medical panels to decide if a whiplash claim is genuine or not.\n\n\"Whiplash injury claims continue to pour in and under current legislation, they are difficult for insurers to reject, even if they think they may be fraudulent, because it is difficult to prove whether or not a claimant has suffered,\" said Mr Douglas."}
{"text": "CASTELNUOVO DI PORTO, Italy (AP) — Pope Francis washed and kissed the feet of Muslim, Orthodox, Hindu and Catholic refugees Thursday, declaring them children of the same God, in a gesture of welcome and brotherhood at a time when anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant sentiment has spiked following the Brussels attacks.\n\nFrancis denounced the carnage as a \"gesture of war\" carried out by blood-thirsty people beholden to the weapons industry during an Easter Week Mass with asylum seekers at the shelter in Castelnuovo di Porto, outside Rome.\n\nThe Holy Thursday rite re-enacts the foot-washing ritual Jesus performed on his apostles before being crucified, and is meant as a gesture of service.\n\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up\n\nFrancis contrasted that gesture with the \"gesture of destruction\" carried out by the Brussels attackers, saying they wanted to destroy the brotherhood of humanity represented by the migrants.\n\n\"We have different cultures and religions, but we are brothers and we want to live in peace,\" Francis said in his homily, delivered off-the-cuff in the windy courtyard of the center.\n\nSeveral of the migrants then wept as Francis knelt before them, poured holy water from a brass pitcher over their feet, wiped them clean and kissed them.\n\nFrancis was greeted with a banner reading \"Welcome\" in a variety of languages as he walked down a makeshift aisle to celebrate the outdoor Mass. But only a fraction of the 892 asylum seekers living at the shelter attended, and many of the seats were left empty. Those who came out, though, received a personal greeting: At the end of the Mass, Francis greeted each refugee, one by one, posing for selfies and accepting notes as he moved down the rows.\n\nVatican rules had long called for only men to participate in the ritual, and past popes and many priests traditionally performed it on 12 Catholic men, recalling Jesus' 12 apostles and further cementing the doctrine of an all-male priesthood.\n\nFrancis shocked many Catholics within weeks of his 2013 election by performing the ritual on women and Muslims at a juvenile detention center. After years of violating the rules outright, Francis in January changed the regulations to explicitly allow women and girls to participate.\n\nThe Vatican said Thursday that four women and eight men took part. The women included an Italian Catholic who works at the center and three Eritrean Coptic Christian migrants. The men included four Catholics from Nigeria, three Muslims from Mali, Syria and Pakistan and a Hindu man from India.\n\nThe Vatican's new norms said anyone from the \"people of God\" could be chosen to participate in the ceremony. While the phrase \"people of God\" usually refers to baptized Christians, the decree also said that pastors should instruct \"both the chosen faithful and others so that they may participate in the rite consciously, actively and fruitfully,\" suggesting that the rite could be open to non-Catholics as well.\n\nFrancis seemed to define \"people of God\" as open-ended.\n\n\"All of us, together: Muslims, Hindi, Catholics, Copts, Evangelicals. But brothers, children of the same God,\" he said. \"We want to live in peace, integrated.\"\n\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press."}
{"text": "Obama then redoubled this unforced error by announcing an even more draconian drawdown of U.S. troops in 2014, not on the basis of on-the-ground military conditions, but with the political timetable of getting all troops out by the end of his own tenure. The predictable result was that security conditions deteriorated, eventually forcing the White House to stop short of the complete withdrawal it had promised, but only after U.S. forces had been severely pared back, the Taliban had reclaimed momentum, and regional powers had stepped up their support for insurgents in anticipation of a post-American Afghanistan.\n\nWhat Washington has never attempted in Afghanistan, over the course of more than 15 years there, is the one policy that has been necessary from the outset: an explicit commitment to a sustainable, sustained U.S. military presence in the country.\n\nMaking such a commitment would send the unequivocal message to the Taliban that it cannot hope to prevail on the battlefield and must therefore pursue political reconciliation seriously. It would also position America for the tough diplomacy to convince Afghanistan's neighbors, foremost Pakistan, to stop backing insurgent groups in preparation for an American exit.\n\nThe strategic paradox of Afghanistan is that the more the United States has sought to leave, the more it has fostered the conditions that have forced it to stay. By contrast, the sooner Washington can convince all parties to the conflict of its long-term intent to remain, the sooner it can set the conditions to drive the conflict towards an end game.\n\nTo be clear, a sustained U.S. military presence in Afghanistan alone is no guarantee of success. But repeating the mistakes of the past by trying to withdraw troops from the country is a surefire recipe for more failure.\n\nCan Americans stomach an open-ended military commitment to Afghanistan? Didn't they, after all, elect Trump—and for that matter, Obama—in part because they promised to diminish America's overseas burdens? Won't they demand a date by which all of U.S. forces come home?\n\nThis is, in some respects, a strange argument. More than 60 years after the end of the Korean War, tens of thousands of American troops are still deployed there—in the shadow of Kim Jong Un's arsenal—without any hint of domestic controversy, because Americans long ago accepted that this was in the national interest. So too with the enduring U.S. military presence in Europe and Japan after World War II, and across the Middle East since the early 1990s.\n\nIn truth, the foremost responsibility of any president is to keep Americans safe. Preventing Afghanistan from once again becoming a terrorist sanctuary from which attacks on America can be launched is as clear-cut a vital national interest as any in the world. If the price for this is a sustained military presence there—and the alternative, withdrawal, is more likely to result in a terrorist victory along the lines of what happened in Iraq after America left—that is not seemingly a prohibitively difficult case to make to the American people. On the contrary, it is telling that, almost 16 years after 9/11, there is no great groundswell of public protest or opposition to America's current operations in Afghanistan. In a perfect world, of course, U.S. forces wouldn't be required to stay in Afghanistan—or anywhere else for that matter—but as Americans long ago internalized, that is not the world they live in."}
{"text": "Cueing the start of the dance cycle: Core Listening Practice\n\nListen to the whole track: tumbao_without_clave_144bpm.mp3 (4.2 Mb)\n\nWhat is immediately obvious in the pattern is a pair of ringing sounds called the double open tones. (To hear the open tone on its own, play the sample: conga_open.wav, 85 kb) The two open tones of the tumbao moderno increase in prominence as tempo increases (listen to the other \"tumbao_without_clave\" tracks, see Index of Tracks). Moreover, the more you relax and listen to the pattern, the more your ear tunes in to the double open tones as a reference point of the rhythm cycle.\n\nRhythm Principles\n\nSalsa is danced with three steps and a pause, where the pause effects a phase change. The three steps occur in the time between two sets of double open tones, and the pause occurs when the double open tones sound. In terms of steps: you are inactive as the double open tones sound to cue the start of the new dance cycle; you become active just after they sound, coinciding with the start of the dance cycle; your activity continues, filling the empty \"space\" between two sets of double open tones; your activity ends or pauses just before the tones sound.\n\nSalsa Practices\n\n[Using the \"tumbao_without_clave\" tracks.] Exercise 1.1\n\nSolo, take three pedalling steps on the spot in the time between the double open tones. Use the pause to listen clearly for the open tones. Your aim is to fill the \"space\" in between the sets of double open tones completely. If you snatch at the steps, you'll end up with longer pauses, and more staccato timing. Exercise 1.2\n\nSolo, substitute the three static steps with three travelling ones. The walks can be taken in any direction. All learning points are identical to Exercise 1.1. During the double open tones, you have two options: you can bring your body to a complete stop, or you can keep your torso travelling. The latter is more challenging because your body and non-supporting leg continue to travel while the tones sound, and the travel has to be timed so that your footfall occurs immediately after the second open tone. Exercise 1.3\n\nSolo, all seven basics from the Salsa: Level One tutorials. We recommend doing them in the order that they are listed. Exercise 1.4\n\nSolo, practice the contents of Exercises 1.1 - 1.3 all jumbled up. Don't forget to include rotations and circular movement. Exercise 1.5\n\nAll the previous practices, partnered. (!)\n\nFundamentally, there are two ways of approaching this tutorial. You can think of it as: moving in a way that lets the double open tones shine through, or\n\nfitting your steps in the space between two sets of these double open tones. The first is about control: the superimposition of your movement over the music. This is the dictative model. The second is about immersion: placing your movement inside the framework provided by music. This is the co-operative model. Both philosophies are valid, although the relative ratios in which they are applied vary between live and recorded music settings."}
{"text": "Microsoft is not a company renowned for changing its mind on things, but that's exactly what the company did today with its Xbox One console.\n\nAfter a month of criticisms of its always-on DRM systems for game trade-ins and the online requirement, the Xbox team did something virtually unheard of in the video game industry - it changed its tune.\n\nGone are the requirements of the Xbox One checking in to Xbox servers every 24 hours. Gone are the restrictions on traded-in games.\n\nAnd perhaps best of all for Australian gamers, gone are the arbitrary restrictions of region coding.\n\nSince the dawn of the original Xbox, Microsoft has restricted the games that the console can play depending on where you live.\n\nBut as part of Don Mattrick's Xbox One 80 announcement came confirmation that regional restrictions have gone the way of… Well, the way of the Xbox One's daily Internet check-in.\n\nWhile Australia has managed to get away with playing games from the UK thanks to shared region coding, the Xbox One will be the first Microsoft console to let Australian gamers buy games online from places like America and Japan.\n\nSave a buck, save the world\n\nThis is a big deal. Despite Microsoft confirming that One games will cost the same as their 360 counterparts, the fact remains that the price of games varies greatly around the world.\n\nFor Australians, who regularly face recommended retail prices of $120 a game (compared to $US70) in America), this is a very convenient way of saving some money on a games library.\n\nEven with shipping, in many cases it's cheaper to buy a game from the US than it is to pick it up from the local EB Games store.\n\nAnd while many pundits are now lamenting the lost possibility of Steam-like savings that Microsoft could have offered with its original, DRM-laden Xbox One, the fact remains that region free gaming is a proven way to save money on games.\n\nBut even more importantly than cost, having a region free console allows gamers to experience games that might not get an Australian release. Fans of JRPGs, for example, will be able to import games without needing a foreign console.\n\nAnd who can forget the frustrations of Rock Band lovers in the current generation who couldn't purchase the game's sequel in Australia without importing?\n\nThe good news also translates for non-Australians: this will also have the benefit of killing off the rumour that the Xbox One would only work in 21 countries around the world.\n\nIt's only a game\n\nIt's not all fireworks and champagne for international bargain hunters though. While Mattrick made it abundantly clear that Xbox One games will not have region locking, there has been no indication that the same rule will apply to Blu-ray discs or content available through the Xbox Live Marketplace.\n\nIn fact, given the similarities between the new terms and the Xbox 360's offering, it's unlikely the console will be completely region free.\n\nTo be fair, it's unlikely that Sony is looking at unlocking movie and PSN content across regions. But regardless of console manufacturer, it's still an arbitrary restriction for international gamers.\n\nBut perhaps we protest too much. The fact that the Xbox One and the PS4 are both games consoles, having region-free games is still a step in the right direction for Microsoft, and a much more palatable solution for gamers."}
{"text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. — A federal judge has rejected President Donald Trump's free speech defense against a lawsuit accusing him of inciting violence against protesters at a campaign rally.\n\nTrump's lawyers sought to dismiss the lawsuit by three protesters who say they were roughed up by his supporters at a March 1, 2016 rally in Louisville, Kentucky. They argued that Trump didn't intend for his supporters to use force.\n\nTwo women and a man say they were shoved and punched by audience members at Trump's command. Much of it was captured on video and widely broadcast during the campaign, showing Trump pointing at the protesters and repeating \"get them out.\"\n\nJudge David J. Hale in Louisville ruled Friday that the suit against Trump, his campaign and three of his supporters can proceed. Hale found ample facts supporting allegations that the protesters' injuries were a \"direct and proximate result\" of Trump's actions, and noted that the Supreme Court has ruled out constitutional protections for speech that incites violence.\n\n\"It is plausible that Trump's direction to 'get 'em out of here' advocated the use of force,\" the judge wrote. \"It was an order, an instruction, a command.\"\n\nPlaintiffs Kashiya Nwanguma, Molly Shah and Henry Brousseau allege that they were physically attacked by several members of the audience, including Matthew Heimbach, Alvin Bamberger and an unnamed defendant they have yet to be able to identify.\n\nBamberger later apologized to the Korean War Veterans Association, whose uniform he wore at the rally. He wrote that he \"physically pushed a young woman down the aisle toward the exit\" after \"Trump kept saying 'get them out, get them out,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nHeimbach, for his part, sought to dismiss the lawsuit's discussion of his association with a white nationalist group and of statements he made about how Trump could advance the group's interests. The judge declined, saying such information could be important context when determining punitive damages.\n\nRelated: Lawsuit Filed Against Trump Over Violence at Kentucky Rally\n\nThe judge also declined to remove allegations that Nwanguma, an African-American, was the victim of racial, ethnic and sexist slurs from the crowd at the rally. This context may support the plaintiffs' claims of negligence and incitement by Trump and his campaign, the judge said.\n\n\"While the words themselves are repulsive, they are relevant to show the atmosphere in which the alleged events occurred,\" Hale wrote.\n\nDonald Trump speaks at the Kentucky International Convention Center in Louisville, Kentucky on March 1, 2016. Aaron P. Bernstein / Getty Images, file\n\nLawyers for Trump and his campaign also argued that they cannot be held liable because they had no duty to the plaintiffs, who assumed the risk of injury when they decided to protest at the rally. The judge countered that under the law, every person has a duty to every other person to use care to prevent foreseeable injury.\n\n\"In sum, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have adequately alleged that their harm was foreseeable and that the Trump Defendants had a duty to prevent it,\" the judge ruled, referring the case to a federal magistrate, Judge H. Brent Brennenstuhl, to handle preliminary litigation, discovery and settlement efforts."}
{"text": "NEW YORK/HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. East Coast refiners are on a Brazilian crude buying spree, market sources say, displacing West African cargoes as producers such as Royal Dutch Shell and Norway's Statoil sell rising output from fields off Brazil's coast.\n\nThe Philadelphia Energy Solutions oil refinery owned by The Carlyle Group is seen at sunset in Philadelphia March 26, 2014. Picture taken March 26, 2014. REUTERS/David M. Parrott/File Photo\n\nThe uptick in Brazilian imports into the region comes as the only Latin America producer to increase output in recent years seeks markets close to home for the oil it is pumping from the massive offshore subsalt oilfields under development.\n\nFebruary deliveries of Brazilian crude into the U.S. East Coast are expected to hit 2.4 million barrels, or 86,000 barrels-per-day, the highest monthly volume since at least 2009, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration and Reuters shipping data.\n\nThe strong February numbers follow a surge in Brazilian oil shipments into the region that started last September that pushed the annual figure for all of 2016 past 2012 volumes.\n\n\"It's cheaper than West African crude,\" said one East Coast trader, when asked why the volume was rising.\n\nThe grades of crude being shipped include Iracema, Lula, Peregrino and Sapinhoa.\n\nBrazilian medium grades compete with some African crudes, especially those from Angola.\n\nChina has been taking more Angolan crude over the past year, gobbling up almost all the medium and heavy crude West Africa has to offer in recent months.\n\nBrazilian crude was once a mainstay on the U.S. East Coast, averaging roughly 50,000 bpd in 2009, on the eve of the shale revolution that upended trade routes. U.S. Bakken crude pushed out foreign imports on the East Coast from 2010 until 2015, but the reliance on domestic supplies proved short-lived.\n\nSome grades are shipped from Uruguayan waters, others from the new Acu terminal at northeast of Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\"Prices for Lula, Sapinhoa and Iracema are currently at around the same level: Dated Brent -$1.50 per barrel for February delivery going out from Uruguay coast,\" said a trader.\n\nBrazil's offshore crudes require a costly transportation method including dynamic positioning vessels capable of loading at floating platforms.\n\nMost companies operating offshore fields in Brazil ship their barrels in two tranches, which increases freight costs, meaning shippers prefer to sell via relatively short trade routes to North American and European destinations.\n\nConsortia formed by Brazil's state-run Petrobras, Shell, Statoil, Portuguese Galp Energia, China's Sinopec and Sinochem and Spanish Repsol are marketing Brazilian grades while increasing output at Santos and Campos basins.\n\nBrazilian crudes remain strong on along the Gulf Coast, averaging roughly 125,000 bpd over the past two years, according to EIA data.\n\nThe biggest buyers on the U.S. East Coast are PBF Energy and Philadelphia Energy Solutions, according to market sources and Reuters shipping data. Monroe Energy, a subsidiary of Delta Airlines, bought two cargoes in October, but has not made any additional purchases, according to a source familiar with the details."}
{"text": "World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. said Thursday that it will slash 7% of its workforce after costs of ramping up its online-subscription service WWE Network helped put it into the red in the second quarter.\n\nWWE reported a net loss of $14.5 million, compared with a net profit of $5.2 million a year earlier. The staff cuts, and other cost-cutting moves, would help boost operating income before depreciation and amortization by $30 million in 2015, WWE said. A company spokesman said the cuts, which will total around 50 to 60 people, will affect all business units.\n\nWWE's launch of WWE Network in February made it one of the few entertainment companies with a presence in cable television to also sell a stand-alone online offering. WWE still has shows on television, such as \"Raw\" and \"Smackdown\" on channels owned by Comcast Corp.'s NBCUniversal, although in May WWE failed in a bid to win a big increase in the TV fees it receives from NBCU.\n\nOn Thursday WWE reported net additions of 33,000 subscribers for WWE Network since April, lifting total subscribers to 700,000. WWE has previously set a year-end target of one million subscribers and has noted that 1.3 million to 1.4 million subscribers would put it past a break-even point offsetting difficulties in pay-per-view.\n\nWWE Network gives fans willing to pay $9.99 a month access to various programming, including from WWE's library, as well as the monthly specials previously available on pay-per-view on television.\n\nWWE initially asked subscribers for a six-month commitment. With the six months coming to an end in August, Benchmark Company analyst Mike Hickey said there were concerns that WWE would see a \"roll off\" of subscribers from late August through October.\n\nTo perhaps stave off those who may not renew the subscription through the summer and early fall, the company will add additional methods of payment, including a commitment-free $19.99 monthly plan. On a call with analysts, WWE executives said they expected to see 4%-8% of subscribers churn off every month.\n\n\"For us the payment options are one way to continue learning, to see how people approach it,\" said George Barrios, chief strategy and financial officer. \"The fact that we've gone from 0 to 700,000 paying subscribers, I feel really proud.\"\n\nWWE shares spiked after the earnings report Thursday morning before leveling off, trading 3% up at $12.54 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nWrite to Steven Perlberg at Steven.Perlberg@wsj.com\n\nAccess Investor Kit for Comcast Corp.\n\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=A591&isin=US20030N1019\n\nAccess Investor Kit for Comcast Corp.\n\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=A591&isin=US20030N2009\n\nAccess Investor Kit for World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.\n\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=A591&isin=US98156Q1085\n\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires"}

It's too dark too see. I don't know them. People are giving them life jackets. People are trying to help them. There are 9 or 10 people.

{"text": "Troll Hunter (2010), what you should watch instead of Jack the Giant Slayer\n\nMY CALL: Good special effects, a dash of realistic biology and an interesting story make Trollhunter that which I always strive to find: something entertaining and unlike anything else I've seen. Clutch writing makes the characters as interesting as the monsters—a task which I feel is generally difficult. This film gets a solid, John-approved \"A\". IF YOU LIKE THIS, WATCH: Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale (2010) and Thale (2012). Both are also Scandinavian folklore-themed movies.\n\nThe movie opens with a mood-setting disclaimer that it was formed by chronologically assembling footage left behind by an anti-Mythbusters documentary film crew from the University of Volda. How very Norse-Blair Witch Project meets Cloverfield of them. The camerawork has all of the appeal of Cloverfield without the headache-inducing shakiness (except when briefly appropriate, for example, running from a troll!).\n\nThis film follows a group of student filmmakers as they follow Hans. Originally suspected of being a bear poacher, Hans is actually a somewhat bitter, poorly paid government employee charged with \"troll management\". This sounds slapstick-ridiculous, but I swear it is delivered very well with a straight face. Hans is charged with tracking and killing trolls that have wandered from their government-delineated territory—like a secret wildlife preserve. He hopes that filming these creatures and informing the public could improve future troll management strategies…that, and he's clearly sick of the secrecy and, perhaps, being under-appreciated.\n\nLike a teenager on his first hunting trip with dad, they follow Hans' instructions and wash their armpits and crotch thoroughly before applying \"troll scent\" which, by their reactions, likely smells like a melted corpse. One last piece of advice: don't be a Christian. Evidently trolls hate Christians and all things Christian. Muslims, on the other hand, should be okay.\n\nThe depictions of the trolls stayed in the true spirit of classic folklore. But still there was a subtle attempt to explain a bit about troll biology. As a biologist, I found this charming. The extra heads (accessory organs, really) that some trolls develop throughout their life cycle assist them in peacocking to impress females and to intimidate other trolls. There are also two species (groups), each with various subspecies (types), of trolls. In as detailed a manner as one could expect from a movie like this, they even explain why trolls turn to stone when exposed to ultraviolet light (and why some explode instead). Troll detection, tracking, various baiting techniques, gestation periods, intelligence, and the simple fact that they are mammals are all addressed, even if only briefly. It's all very cool, understated, and strangely realistic–despite the trolls.\n\nThe behavior and variety of the trolls they encounter make this film feel like Where the Wild Things Are for fanboys. There are several different troll scenes and the types of trolls differ as much as the circumstances of their encounter. While the effects are not amazing, they are every bit as good as they need to be to maintain the credibility of a world in which trolls exist and, more importantly, to keep us entertained. I never felt that the effects \"could have been better\".\n\nIf you like monster movies then this is a MUST SEE for you!"}
{"text": "Veteran American entertainer Jerry Lewis, whose goofy brand of physical comedy endeared him to millions in a career spanning six decades, died on Sunday aged 91, his agent told AFP.\n\nOne of the most popular comic actors of the 1950s and '60s, Lewis perfected the role of the quirky clown in slapstick comedies like \"The Nutty Professor\" but also won acclaim as a writer, actor and philanthropist.\n\n\"Very sadly Jerry Lewis has passed,\" his agent Jeff Wijtas told AFP. Variety reported that the comic legend died in Las Vegas early Sunday morning.\n\nHonored with accolades at home and abroad, including a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977, Lewis became known as much for his tireless efforts to promote awareness of Muscular Dystrophy as for his unique brand of physical comedy.\n\nOver the course of 45 years, he raised some 2.45 billion dollars for combatting the disease with an annual television event.\n\nBorn Joseph Levitch in Newark, New Jersey to two New York City entertainers, Lewis first took center stage at the tender age of five, when he performed \"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\" He began playing at resorts outside New York City that catered to Jewish patrons, known by touring entertainers as the Borscht Circuit.\n\nBy age 15, he had assembled his own routine of comedic lipsynching and made the rounds of New York talent agents, although only a burlesque house in Buffalo was interested.\n\nAt the age of 20, however, everything changed for Lewis, when he embarked on arguably one of the most successful entertainment partnerships of all time with smooth crooner Dean Martin.\n\nThe two fed off each other in now-classic comedy gags, including pratfalls, slapstick and lots of seltzer water. They signed a long-term contract with Paramount Pictures, and starred in 1949's \"My Friend Irma,\" where Lewis delivered a performance described as \"the funniest thing in the picture.\"\n\n– 'Finish what I started' –\n\nOther notable films in Lewis' repertoire include \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\" (1959), \"The Geisha Boy\" (1958) and \"Funnybones\" (1984).\n\nHis box office grosses, spanning nearly 50 years, total 800 million dollars — an impressive figure since movie tickets cost no more than 50 cents during the height of his popularity.\n\nAfter 17 films together, the Lewis-Martin partnership split in 1956, but Lewis continued his career in comedy and Hollywood. He won acclaim for his dramatic role in the 1983 Martin Scorsese film \"The King of Comedy,\" co-starring with Robert De Niro that showed his acting versatility.\n\nIn recent decades, Lewis had been plagued by health problems, and was declared clinically dead in 1982 after a heart attack. Ten years later he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and in 1997 found out he had diabetes. A diagnosis of spinal meningitis in 2000 further caused his health to deteriorate.\n\nBut he was determined not to let ill health keep him from working as long as possible, including on a Broadway musical adaptation of \"The Nutty Professor\" as recently as 2011.\n\n\"I have to finish what I've started,\" he told the Los Angeles Times in a 2010 interview. \"I want to do it before I leave.\""}

{"text": "WASHINGTON ― The Jones Act waiver for Puerto Rico expired Sunday night, and \"it is not being extended at this time,\" Department of Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan told HuffPost on Monday.\n\nDHS had temporarily waived the Jones Act ― an arguably outdated law that imposes exorbitant shipping costs on the U.S. island ― on Sept. 28. The waiver had meant that Puerto Rico had the option of importing food, fuel and supplies more quickly, and for half the cost, in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.\n\nWith the 1920 law back in effect, the island is now required to pay much higher costs to import supplies. The Jones Act requires that all goods shipped between U.S. ports be carried by U.S.-owned and operated ships, which are more expensive vessels than others in the global marketplace. That's meant that Puerto Rico pays double the costs to import goods from the U.S. mainland compared with neighboring islands ― and that U.S. vessels are making bank.\n\nThe return to higher shipping costs won't help Puerto Rico as it tries to climb out of economic devastation. Nearly half of the 3.4 million Americans on the island still don't have drinking water since Maria hit nearly three weeks ago. Just 15 percent have electricity. Many people still haven't heard from loved ones, and at least 39 deaths have been attributed to the storm.\n\nLapan said DHS is \"always prepared to review requests on a case-by-case basis and respond quickly\" to possible waivers of the Jones Act. But those decisions have to be related to national defense, he said, and are not driven by cost-related matters.\n\n\"We believe that extending the waiver is unnecessary to support the humanitarian relief efforts on the island,\" Lapan said. \"There is an ample supply of Jones Act-qualified vessels to ensure that cargo is able to reach Puerto Rico.\"\n\nMario Tama via Getty Images Maria Chiclano, who has no running water or power in her home, washes clothes with her sons in the Espiritu Santo river during heavy rains, more than two weeks after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico.\n\nDespite DHS' position, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello said Monday night that he wants another extension of the Jones Act waiver.\n\n\"I think we should have it,\" Rossello told CBS News' David Begnaud. \"In this emergency phase, while we're looking to sustain and save lives, we should have all of the assets at hand.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who is spending Monday golfing, had originally hedged on waiving the Jones Act for Puerto Rico at all, saying \"a lot of shippers\" didn't want him to do it. He eventually caved to pressure from lawmakers including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).\n\nMcCain has been pushing to get rid of the Jones Act altogether. It costs Puerto Rico hundreds of millions of dollars every year, and he recently introduced legislation to nix the law.\n\n\"Now that the temporary Jones Act waiver for Puerto Rico has expired, it is more important than ever for Congress to pass my bill to permanently exempt Puerto Rico from this archaic and burdensome law,\" McCain said in a statement to HuffPost. \"Until we provide Puerto Rico with long-term relief, the Jones Act will continue to hinder much-needed efforts to help the people of Puerto Rico recover and rebuild from Hurricane Maria.\""}

{"text": "TCU's Gary Patterson has a new contract that will make him the Horned Frogs' coach through the 2018 season, the school announced.\n\nA source said that Patterson's total package pays him close to $3 million per season and that the entire deal is guaranteed.\n\nThe Frogs just completed their first perfect season since winning a national championship in 1938. The 13-0 mark included a Rose Bowl victory over Wisconsin, the school's second consecutive BCS appearance.\n\n\"TCU let me grow as a coach,\" Patterson, who was watching the Cotton Bowl from his home Friday night, told ESPNDallas.com. \"They gave me an opportunity to be a head coach and to do what we've been able to do. We've come a long way in 13 years and it's been fun to be a part of it. I feel like I'm just a member of the staff. The entire university, not just the football program, is trying to win championships.\"\n\nPatterson said he met with his coaching staff Monday following the Rose Bowl to go over recruiting video and then went out on recruiting visits all week. TCU has recruiting weekends coming up this month in preparation for February's signing day.\n\nHe said part of his new contract was that he made sure his assistants were also taken care of, from his coordinators to the equipment managers.\n\n\"We're 0-0 now,\" said Patterson, who turns 51 in February. \"You have to work even harder once you have success. That's the way you make sure you can do it again and for the next five years.\"\n\nTCU athletic director Chris Del Conte did not want to comment on Patterson's annual salary, and TCU doesn't have to disclose it as a private institution.\n\n\"He's a top-10 coach and he's being paid accordingly,\" Del Conte told ESPNDallas.com on Friday night.\n\nPatterson received nine National Coach of the Year honors in 2009 after leading TCU to a Fiesta Bowl appearance against Boise State. He is 98-28, the best record of any TCU coach with at least 100 games under his belt. He's second at the school only to Dutch Meyer, who had 109 wins and coached two national championship teams (1935 and 1938) at TCU.\n\nDel Conte said that Patterson sat down with TCU before the Rose Bowl and agreed to the parameters of the extension. Patterson's contract was extended two years after 2009 and the university wanted to do the same after this season.\n\n\"We want him at TCU and he wants to be here,\" Del Conte said. \"This deal takes him until he's 58.\"\n\nPatterson has led the Horned Frogs to double-digit wins in seven of his 10 seasons. They are 36-3 overall the past three years and are poised to finish No. 2 in the country when this season is over. His .778 winning percentage is second nationally among active coaches with a minimum of five years' experience.\n\nThe Horned Frogs have won six conference titles with Patterson on the staff and have 12 bowl appearances in 13 years, going 8-4 with Patterson either as defensive coordinator or head coach.\n\nBefore Patterson showed up in Fort Worth, the program had four bowl wins in its history.\n\nRichard Durrett covers colleges for ESPNDallas.com.

{"text": "Almarai Co., Saudi Arabia's largest dairy company, has bought about 14,000 acres in drought-stricken Southern California and Arizona in an effort to grow hay for its massive herd of cows. The purchase has fueled debate over whether a patchwork of laws and court rulings give too much weight to growers of thirsty crops such as alfalfa. Some answers to common questions about the deal:\n\n___\n\nQ: Why is Saudi Arabia's largest dairy company buying U.S. land?\n\nA: To conserve water, the country has adopted bans on selected crops. Agriculture accounted for 90 percent of Saudi Arabia's water consumption, according to a 2013 study by the Oxford Business Group.\n\nSaudi Arabia identified the United States as one of 16 countries for agricultural investment in 2010, according to a memo from the U.S. embassy in Riyadh to the U.S. Agriculture Department that was obtained by WikiLeaks. The embassy said the investment could be \"a tangible demonstration of the value of outreach to the Muslim world and (could) offer an opportunity to broaden and deepen our relationship.\" The memo noted that while food security has not been a major problem in Saudi Arabia, \"food prices have become politically sensitive.\"\n\n___\n\nQ: What do the locals think?\n\nA: Some have raised concern about the amount of water needed but many welcome the economic boost that Almarai has given as worries about China have dimmed prospects for alfalfa exports. Jack Seiler, who farms about 3,800 acres in Palo Verde Valley, now sells about 30 percent of his harvest to Almarai, compared with nothing a few years ago.\n\n\"They're banging it out, I'm telling you,\" said Seiler. \"They kind of cleaned us out of summer hay … They want to farm.\"\n\nSeiler voices more concern about the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. Last year, the nation's largest distributor of drinking water became Palo Verde Valley's largest landowner, tapping a deep distrust between farm and city that pervades the West.\n\n___\n\nQ: What are the water rights in these areas?\n\nA: Palo Verde Valley enjoys California's first rights to water from the Colorado River, a lifeline to seven Western U.S. states and northern Mexico. A 1922 compact that parceled out allotments gave California more than 10 times what Nevada got.\n\nCalifornia long consumed more Colorado River water than it was entitled to, which was never a problem until Sunbelt cities like Phoenix and Las Vegas began to clamor for their full share. A 2003 truce among California's warring water agencies kept the Palo Verde Irrigation District at the front of the line and also left the agricultural Imperial Valley near the top of the pecking order. That honored a Gold Rush era-doctrine that the first settlers to stake claim hold the highest-priority rights.\n\nLa Paz County, Arizona, is free of well-pumping restrictions that hamstring many of the state's largest cities under a 1980 law to protect aquifers. The city of Phoenix bought about 13,000 acres there in 1986 and sold it in 2012 after giving up on building infrastructure to carry water about 100 miles to the nation's sixth-largest city. The city of Scottsdale has about 1,200 acres in the area on the premise that it will eventually have a system to move water from farm to city."}
{"text": "Leaked TPP Pushes ISP Content Filters, Kicking Users Offline Wikileaks this week released a copy of the latest version of the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) that has been under construction behind closed doors for years. As we've long noted, the TPP attempts to take some of the worst aspects of U.S. copyright law and foist them upon the globe. Mike Masnick at Techdirt has a good take on what the TPP will do to copyright law in general, most notably making serious broad-scale copyright reform impossible.\n\nquote: The US proposal, which enjoys support from Australia (and support for some provisions from Singapore, New Zealand, and Peru) features far more conditions for ISP limitation of liability that could lead to subscriber service termination and content blocking (Canada, Brunei, Vietnam, and Mexico oppose the approach). Under the U.S. model, specific actions are required for specific limitations of liability. For example, a limitation of liability for automated caching is subject to four requirements, including \"removing or disabling access, on receipt of an effective notification of claimed infringement, to cached material that has been removed or access to which has been disabled at the originating site.\" In addition to greater ISP liability and the continued attempt to block content or kick users offline (ideas we had seemed to be moving away from globally and here in the States as draconian and dysfunctional), the leaked TPP draft also includes a measure that could make life harder for companies like Aereo to challenge the cable TV status quo. Directly from the TPP: quote: [US propose: Notwithstanding Article QQ.G.16 [limitations and exceptions] and Article QQ.G.14.3(b) [over the air broadcasting reference], no Party may permit the retransmission of television signals (whether terrestrial, cable, or satellite) on the Internet without the authorization of the right holder or right holders of the content of the signal and, if any, of the signal .] Based on all of these changes it's fairly apparent which industry is in the driving seat when it comes to getting these proposals included in the draft. The EFF also has an analysis of the leaked TPP you should probably read On the broadband front, TPP continues the effort to make ISPs more liable for enforcement of copyright infringement on their networks. In other words, higher prices whether you pirate or not as the carrier passes notification, filtering and anti-piracy Whac-A-Mole support costs on to you.

{"text": "It isn't suicide, it's murder: Part 2 – Too close to home: Langford man hounded to death over council tax dispute February 18, 2012\n\nPosted by Phil Groom in Death Tags: Biggleswade Chronicle\n\nTHIS IS THE STORY that ran on the front cover of our local paper, The Biggleswade Chronicle, yesterday, and it's a story that's as tragic as it gets: in short, Peter Williams, who was clinically depressed and lived here in Langford, didn't pay his council tax for several years around the turn of the millennium, was made bankrupt and eventually, faced with the threat of eviction from his home, killed himself on the railway at Biggleswade last week.\n\nI'll let one of his friends take up the story, as published in the Chronicle:\n\nHis friend, Richard Harris, who assisted Peter in his legal battles, said: \"His council pursued him relentlessly and aggressively over a period of some 16 years without helping him. It culminated in them bankrupting him over a £1,350 debt in 2006, seeking to evict him from his home, which was worth in excess of £200,000, that he owned outright.\"\n\nThe report goes on to quote a Central Beds Council spokesman explaining that the unpaid £1,350 represented legal costs incurred by the council and its solicitors in pursuing Mr Williams — but, if you'll forgive me colloquialising, \"it ain't our fault, guv, honest\" because the debt had been handed over to Grant Thornton, acting as bankruptcy trustees, and apparently they were the ones behind the eviction proceedings as part of the debt recovery process.\n\nThe council, on the other hand, were right there supporting Mr Williams:\n\n[The spokesman] added that the council's emergency duty team was in touch with Peter earlier this month and referred him for an urgent mental health assessment. Last year the Local Government Ombudsman investigated the council's relationship with Peter and said there were no grounds on which to criticise the council.\n\nSo where does that leave us? A man with known mental health problems, hounded to death over a council tax dispute, and a blameless council. Maybe I'm missing something here: I never knew Peter, even though he lived in the same village as me, and unlike the Local Government Ombudsman, I'm not privy to the ins and outs of Peter's story and have only the Chronicle report to go on; but assuming the accuracy of that report, I have a couple of simple questions for Central Beds Council:\n\nWho let the dogs out? Since you knew about Peter's mental health problems, why didn't you call them off?\n\nSeems to me that transferring a debt to a third party, then denying all responsibility when that third party's pursuit of that debt results in a tragedy such as this, simply doesn't wash, any more than Pontius Pilate washing his hands absolved him of responsibility for the death of Jesus.\n\nNo one should be hounded by debt collectors to the point where they can see no way forward beyond taking their own life; and when a person has a known record of mental health difficulties, even more caution is called for.\n\nWhich begs the question: was it suicide, or murder?\n\nA shortened version of this post has been sent as a letter to the Biggleswade Chronicle.\n\nAdvertisements"}
{"text": "A radio frequency transmitter transmits waves which are the only means to ascertain the health of the lander. (Representational pictures)\n\nIn a major achievement, the Giant Metre-wave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at Khodad detected and tracked the landing of a European Space Agency spacecraft on a Mars mission, an official said here on Thursday.\n\n\"On Wednesday evening from 7.04 p.m., the GMRT clearly detected and tracked the weak signal emanating from Schiaparelli EDM, all the way into the last phases of the descent of module through the Martian atmosphere till 8.37 p.m.,\" said GMRT Dean Yashwant Gupta.\n\nWatch What Else Is Making News\n\nSchiaparelli's entry and descent module (EDM) of the ExoMarch Project separated from the parent spacecraft, the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) on October 16 after a six-month-long journey from Earth. It followed a trajectory that brought it to the point of entering the Martian atmosphere for a landing on Wednesday (October 19) evening, Gupta said.\n\n\"The six-minute journey through the (Martian) atmosphere is the most hazardous part of the project and many previous Mars lander missions have failed at this critical juncture,\" Gupta said.\n\nA radio frequency transmitter transmits waves which are the only means to ascertain the health of the lander. It must be ensured that the lander, travelling at very high speeds, doesn't get overheated and lands without damage. During this period, the GMRT observed, detected and transmitted the waves received from the lander live to the ExoMars Mission Control centre in Germany.\n\nIn order to monitor the health of the EDM during this crucial phase, the US's NASA had assigned GMRT, to act as a receiver station for this mission on behalf of the ExoMars Project, he added. Terming it as \"a historic achievement\", Gupta said that with this, GMRT has extended its scope to the arena of planetary space missions.\n\nElaborating on the challenge GMRT faced, Gupta said the signal at a frequency of 401 MHz is very weak, emitted by a 5W transmitter on the EDM and it required the high sensitivity and interference-free environment of the GMRT to detect it.\n\n\"The receivers covering this frequency have been developed by National Centre of Radio Astrophysics of Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, as part of GMRT's upgrade, well in time for this (Mars) mission,\" Gupta said.\n\nThe detection was made possible by signals from the GMRT antennae and analysing them with special signal processing software that was jointly developed by GMRT and NASA. The display from GMRT was streamed live to the ExoMars Mission Control centre in Germany, which provided valuable real-time monitoring facility to the project team there.\n\nIn fact, the Pune-based observatory's system was tested in August-September with test signals generated by the NASA's Mars Rover, which is currently exploring the Martian surface and GMRT had successfully detected them, he said. The GMRT, built and operated by TIFR's NCRA since 15 years, is one of the world's largest and most sensitive radio telescopes operating at metre and centimeter radio wavelengths, situated at Khodad, around 70 km from Pune.\n\nFor all the latest Technology News, download Indian Express App"}

It is much to be lamented that each state, long ago has not hunted them down as pests to society and the greatest enemies we have to the happiness ofJews.\n\n\nOrigins: Anti-Semitic screeds are nothing new; neither, unfortunately, is the practice of attempting to legitimize them by attributing them to the pens and tongues of\n\nrespected figures. After all, if as esteemed a person as George Washington — the Father of Our Country, the first President of the United States of America, the man who \"could not tell a lie\" — said that Jews were a dangerous scourge who should be hunted down as pests, there must be something to it. At the very least, the apocryphal attribution lends an unwarranted credibility to those who would repeat it for their own racist purposes.\n\nThis quote is a recasting of something Washington did say, providing just enough of an aura of authenticity to sound believable. What Washington actually wrote referenced currency speculators who sought to profit by taking advantage of soldiers and others during the Revolutionary War:\n\n\nThis tribe of black gentry work more effectually against us, than the enemy's arms. They are a hundred times more dangerous to our liberties, and the great cause we are engaged in. It is much to be lamented that each State, long ere this, has not hunted them down as pests to society, and the greatest enemies we have to the happiness of America.\n\n\nWashington's private life and writings reveal no evidence of anti-Semitism, and his public attitude towards religious tolerance was well expressed on a 1790 goodwill visit he paid to Newport, Rhode Island, during his first term as President. When a goodwill address was presented to him by the Hebrew Congregation of Newport, Washington responded by penning \"the first presidential declaration of the free and equal status of Jewish-American citizens\":\n\n\nThe Citizens of the United States of America have a right to applaud themselves for giving to Mankind examples of an enlarged and liberal policy: a policy worthy of imitation. All possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship. It is now no more that toleration is spoken of, as if it was by the indulgence of one class of people that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights. For happily the Government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires only that they who live under its protection, should demean themselves as good citizens. May the Children of the Stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other Inhabitants; while every one shall sit under his own vine and fig tree, and there shall be none to make him afraid.\n\n\nLast updated:\n\n19 March 2011\n\nSources:"}

They have shoulder problems. I think concussions have been made bigger than life.\"\n\nAnother Ram-tough man says there is too much hype about those brain injuries that caused Miller to get lost once for more than an hour on a 20-minute drive home.\n\n\"My belief on concussions is, you get whacked over the head enough, your leaking cerebral fluid thickens into a shell that protects your brain,\" running back Ron Wolfley said. \"Miller's problem is that he has not been hit in the head enough .\"\n\nST. LOUIS — One Ram-tough man in this town likes to joke about quarterback Chris Miller and those brain injuries that caused him to forget addresses, telephone numbers and the day of the week.\n\nOne woman in this town does not agree with either man.\n\nEach time an opposing player nears Chris Miller during games, her stomach grabs her. So she grabs somebody--a friend on the couch, a stranger in the stands, anybody.\n\nShe holds tight until the play is over or the quarterback stands up.\n\n\"Earlier this season, two men sitting in the row in front of me felt my sharp nails and thought I was crazy,\" she said.\n\nThe last time Miller didn't stand up, she was so panicked she ran to the field and demanded to talk to the doctor. She doesn't want to think about the next time.\n\nShe is Jennifer Miller, the quarterback's wife and mother of their two young children. She has watched her husband endure four concussions in the last 13 months.\n\nShe doesn't talk Ram tough.\n\n\"Before every game, I am a wreck,\" she said. \"I worry about him all the time. My No. 1 interest now is to make sure he comes out of the game in one piece. It's hard. It's very hard.\"\n\nStepping into this great divide on Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers, as he does every week, is Miller.\n\nHe has been at his unshaven, barking, swaggering best. He has led a team to first place while ranking sixth in the NFL in passer ratings. He has thrown more touchdown passes than Troy Aikman, 11 to seven, and fewer interceptions than Steve Young, three to four.\n\nBut he has been quietly, vulnerably, caught between the worries of his family and pressure from his associates.\n\nBetween outside medical theories that the next concussion could kill him, and arguments from NFL doctors that such proof does not exist.\n\nIt is a battle that can have many winners.\n\nBut only one loser.\n\nChris Miller stiffens as if challenged to a fight.\n\n\"I don't want to back down,\" he says. \"That's just the way it is.\"\n\n*\n\nNobody will tell Chris Miller to quit.\n\nNot after his head was bounced off the artificial turf in New Orleans last season, causing a concussion that caused him to sit out two starts.\n\nNot after he was jolted by the Saints again less than two months later in Anaheim and missed another start because of a concussion."}
{"text": "It's an odd time in the DC Extended Universe. Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman has made a huge amount of money, and became an example of how to bring a hero to the screen with style and substance. We're awaiting Aquaman's first movie and the new Justice League film, a long-held dream for DC fans, with a sense of quiet anticipation. The sequel to Suicide Squad is being fast-tracked, and there's a Martin Scorsese-produced Joker movie on the way… Strange things are afoot at the circle DC…\n\nYet with a roster of the most recognisable (and profitable) comic book characters on its books DC appear to be having trouble finding their feet. We're post-Logan, post-Deadpool and each new direction a comic book movie succeeds with could well become a template for all that follow.\n\nSo, all eyes are on DC for the foreseeable future. Today we received confirmation that Matthew Vaughn is in talks with DC about the sequel to Man of Steel, and it could be a whole new take on the cinematic Superman.\n\nThe Kick-Ass director was in the mix at Warner Bros. when they were looking to bring about the new cinematic DCEU. The studio ultimately went with the Christopher Nolan/David S. Goyer re-invention of Superman and the visually impressive, yet emotionally cold Man of Steel was the first step into a wider franchise.\n\nCommenting on his 2010 pitch, before Man of Steel went into production, Vaughn offered his opinion to MTV on what a new Superman film should be,\n\n\"I think that's the one thing not to do with Superman, trying to do the serious The Dark Knight version. Superman is about color and fun, or it should be, for me.\"\n\nSpeaking to us at the press junket for Kingsman: The Golden Circle, Vaughn confirmed to Scott Davis,\n\n\"I am planning another Kingman, I've written the treatment and some of the scenes…I don't know what I'm going to do next but I have had chats about Superman, I love Superman. \"If somebody asks me to do Indiana Jones, most of the superheros or Star Wars the fanboy in me can't help but be excited.\"\n\nSee the interview below,\n\nMatthew Vaughn on the new Superman film\n\nTone has been a very difficult element for the DCEU. Though it came in the shadow of The Avengers, Man of Steel, and the follow-up Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, were cast firmly in the, often mocked, 'dark and gritty' mould. At the time it was an understandable decision. Let the tone serve the story, and comparisons to the Marvel films would be moot. However the reaction to Batman v Superman gave the DCEU a stumble on its second step, and the trailers for Suicide Squad subsequently focused heavily on the film's humour. There were dozens of news stories dedicated to how the Justice League film would be lighter and tone, and funnier.\n\nIf Vaughn, and his long time collaborative partner Jane Goldman, are on board for a new Superman film it could be a bold, stabilising step for the ongoing franchise. When the X-Men franchise from Bryan Singer (another Superman director) faltered with the execrable Last Stand, it was Vaughn and Goldman who reinvigorated the series with X-Men: First Class. They could well do the same with Superman."}

{"text": "Only two months until Christmas everyone!\n\nSoph started our Xmas today by soaking lots of dried fruit in booze, I then collected up the leftover packets and went to work on the mincemeat.\n\nWe've got a new slow cooker, so of course I'll be using it for everything! The new one is bigger, and has a timer that switches from high or low to warm. The plan is to set it cooking in the morning before work, have it cook for 8 hours, then let it warm until we get home.\n\nOne benefit of slow cooking this: no need to do things in stages on the hob. Just bung it all in the slow cooker, mix it up, set for 8 hours, and leave it overnight!\n\nThe details of how to slow cook came from The Pink Whisk, with additional ingredients from the veg mincemeat I made last last year, plus whatever Soph had left over :)\n\nSo here's what went in it:\n\n150g light suet\n\n200g suet\n\n400g (aka 2) cooking apples, cored, peeled and diced\n\n140g candied peel\n\n200g raisins\n\n200g currants\n\n200g sultanas\n\n200g cranberries\n\n80g chopped apricots\n\n100g chopped crystallised ginger\n\n250g chopped walnuts and dates mixed\n\n150ml ruby port\n\n60ml Calvados\n\n2tbsp honey\n\n1 tsp ginger\n\n1 tsp cinnamon\n\n1 tsp ground nutmeg\n\n1/2 tsp gournd cloves\n\n100g soft light brown sugar\n\n1 orange, zest and juice\n\n1 lemon, zest and juice\n\nThe only reason for 150g of light suet in there is that we had some lying around. We've discovered it contains palm oil, which we're avoiding for ethical reasons, so from now on it's full-fat suet (not that the light stuff saved many calories anyway).\n\nAnyway as I said… throw it all in the slow cooker, big mix with a big wooden spoon.\n\nThen on for 8 hours on low, then warm until we wake up and deal with it.\n\nNext morning it's all gone lovely and dark!\n\nAfter cooling I took the top off an it smelled amazing!\n\nThen it gets a good stir. Ah. Now we hit a problem… the back left side (which looks dark in the above pic if you look carefully) is actually burnt rock solid :(\n\nThe burnt part is, unsurprisingly, very bitter and not very nice at all. Thankfully the rest of it tastes great :)\n\nNow it's time to put it in jars. These need sterilising first, and as we don't have a dishwasher that means washing in soapy water followed by 5 minutes in a 160c fan oven.\n\nI managed to get 3 full jars out of it.\n\nUnfortunately there was another jar's worth stuck to the pot :(\n\nSo the pot is now soaking… and I'm off to the pub! I'm not sure if I just cooked for too long, kept warm for too long, or if the back left part of my slow cooker is hotter than other parts…\n\nTomorrow I'm planning Tex-Mex chicken in the slow cooker, so I'll keep an eye out for hot spots."}

{"text": "We're pleased to announce that the Tesla Model S has received a maximum-possible 5-star safety rating from the European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP).\n\nModel S is one of just a few cars to have ever achieved a 5-star safety rating from both Euro NCAP and the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Additionally, Model S is the only car this year to have achieved both a 5-star Euro NCAP rating and 5 stars in every NHTSA subcategory, including frontal impact, side impact, and rollover. Only two other cars have earned the same recognition since 2011 (when NHTSA introduced its latest rating scheme).\n\nThe reason so few models achieve 5-star ratings in both Europe and the U.S. is that each program places emphasis on different safety aspects in the assessment process. NHTSA emphasizes structural and restraint safety, with a deep focus on how well the vehicle can withstand and absorb the energy of an impact while protecting its occupants. It is also primarily concerned with adult occupants. On the other hand, Euro NCAP assesses a wider range of scenarios, including tests for child and pedestrian safety. Unlike for NHTSA, active safety is also an important part of Euro NCAP's 5-star requirement. Every year, the European organization raises the standard for a 5-star rating to account for technological advances in the industry.\n\nThe dual 5-star ratings for Model S validate our holistic approach to safety. We have been engineering passive and active safety systems in parallel, so the car is structurally sound and is also designed to intelligently anticipate and react to potentially dangerous situations.\n\nStructurally, Model S has advantages not seen in conventional cars. It has a low center of gravity because its battery pack, the largest mass in the car, is positioned underneath the passenger compartment, making rollover extremely unlikely. It also has a large front crumple zone because of the lack of an engine, meaning it can absorb more energy from a frontal impact, the most common type of crash resulting in fatalities. Its body is reinforced with aluminum extrusions at strategic locations around the car, and the roof can withstand at least 4 g's. It was for these reasons that Model S achieved 5 stars in every subcategory when tested by NHTSA in 2013.\n\nThis quarter, we started implementing the Model S active safety system in conjunction with the introduction of new Autopilot hardware, consisting of 12 ultrasonic sensors that sense up to 16 feet around the car, a forward-looking camera, a forward radar, and a digitally controlled, high-precision electric brake boost. We specifically selected this hardware to accommodate the progressive introduction of new safety features via software updates over the course of the next several months.\n\nWhile the features already pushed to the Model S fleet – Lane Departure Warning and Speed Limit Warning – have proven sufficient to merit a 5-star NCAP rating, we will go much further with active safety systems. Features coming soon include Forward and Side Collision Warning and Avoidance, Blind Spot Warning, and Automatic Emergency Braking.\n\nSafety has always been Tesla's top priority, and we remain committed to continuously improving Model S to ensure that adults, children, and pedestrians alike receive the best possible protection from the car and its technology. In the meantime, Model S owners can be secure in the knowledge that this recognition from Euro NCAP reaffirms their car's outstanding safety qualities."}
{"text": "ispanics - the nation's largest and fastest-growing minority voting bloc - are loyal Democrats and supporters of President Obama in the 2012 election, but a majority have not yet engaged in the campaign, according to a new Pew Hispanic Center study.\n\nTwo-thirds of Latino registered voters identify as Democrats, and 68 percent say they'd support Obama over former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney in a hypothetical match-up.\n\nBut more than half - 56 percent - of Latino registered voters say they've given little or no thought to the presidential candidates in the race. And their approval of Obama and the direction of the country lingers around 50 percent.\n\n\"It is just under a year out from the election, and things may change as we move through 2012, but at this moment, in this snapshot, we see that many Latinos have not given much thought to the candidates who are running,\" said Mark Hugo Lopez, associate director of the Pew Hispanic Center.\n\nThis dynamic signals that the president's reelection campaign will need to continue efforts to engage and mobilize Hispanics - a constituency that aides say will be crucial to victory on Nov. 6.\n\nThe figures also cast doubt on Republican claims about making inroads with Latino voters. More Latinos consider themselves Democrats than Republicans by a 47 percentage point margin - a gap that grew 10 points since 2010.\n\n\"Even though we do see a decline in the president's approval rating among Hispanics, support for him remains just as strong as it was in 2008,\" Lopez said. \"And Obama's margins of victory against Romney and [Texas Gov. Rick] Perry in a hypothetical match-up are nearly as strong if not as strong as they are for the 2008 election.\"\n\nObama's campaign strategists regularly cite the growing Hispanic electorate as an advantage, particularly in battleground states with significant populations of Latino voters.\n\nNationwide, the number of Hispanic Americans eligible to vote has grown by 2 million since 2008, and now totals an estimated 21.7 million eligible voters, according to the Pew Hispanic Center.\n\nStates with surging Latino populations, like Colorado, Georgia and Arizona, are particularly attractive to the Obama campaign.\n\n\"We really look at Arizona and see a state where we can go and expand the electorate, register a whole bunch of young people and traditional Democrats and Latinos that have never been registered before,\" Obama campaign manager Jim Messina told ABC News last month.\n\nObama won 67 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2008 to John McCain's 31 percent.\n\nA senior Republican strategist said the party has taken a close look at the demographics in Georgia and Arizona but insists any modest growth in the Hispanic electorate this year doesn't mean those states will turn blue in 2012.\n\n\"It's something we're paying attention to and what [the Obama campaign] sees there. We've run the numbers and even with Hispanic voters we just don't see it,\" the official said, adding \"we are taking extra precautions though.\"\n\nIf Republicans nominate frontrunner Romney, however, the Pew study suggests he could be in for a serious uphill climb.\n\nOnly 23 percent of Latino registered voters back him in a match-up with Obama. Strategists of both parties say the Republican nominee would need to win between 35 and 40 percent of the Hispanic vote to win the 2012 election.\n\n\"Gov. Romney is on the wrong side of the issues important to Hispanic voters and it's clear that Hispanics recognize that,\" said Obama campaign spokeswoman Gabriela Domenzain."}
{"text": "In what will come as a surprise to some but to absolutely no one with any knowledge of either the rare earth markets or free markets, the great Chinese rare earth monopoly seems to have been broken:\n\nChina's virtual monopoly on rare earth elements used in high-technology applications has been loosened, decreasing the risk that supplies to U.S. defense contractors could be disrupted, according to the Pentagon's latest assessment of the nation's industrial base. \"Global market forces are leading to positive changes in rare earth supply chains, and a sufficient supply of most of these materials likely will be available to the defense industrial base,\" said the Pentagon report by Elana Broitman, the Defense Department's top official on the U.S. industrial base. \"Prices for most rare earth oxides and metals have declined approximately 60 percent from their peaks in the summer of 2011.\"\n\nHere's the background: back 5 years ago 95% of the world's rare earth production came from China. The rest was in India and Russia or ex-Soviet states (indeed, the one I deal with was almost exclusively coming from Russia). Then China decided that they would limit exports from that nation. The declared reason was environmental: it is indeed a messy business. The general assumption was that the reason was rather different. They limited exports of the raw materials but not of anything made from them. Neodymium for example, had an export limit (and serious export taxes) slapped on it, but FeNdB magnets, made from neodymium could be exported without limits or taxes. So we all assumed that the intention was to attract the manufacturing to China and thus increase the amount of value added in that country.\n\nSo, what actually happened? Well, just what people like me, those with more than a passing acquaintance with rare earths and free markets said would happen (indeed, I said it here in Foreign Policy). Mines outside China began to open up, exploration for new mines outside China surged (at one point there were more than 400 such projects going on) and manufacturers started to consider whether they really, really, needed to use rare earths or whether something else would do. Supply went up and demand went down in other words. Thus was the Chinese monopoly broken and prices fell back.\n\nAll of which teaches us something useful about monopolies. Where a monopoly is contestable we don't in fact have to worry about it very much. China was selling us all of the rare earths we wanted, at prices we were happy to pay, for decades. So, they had a monopoly? So what? As soon as they actually tried to take advantage of that monopoly then it all fell apart for them. They actually, by attempting to restrict supply, managed to call into being their own competition.\n\nThis has applications in other ares of current concern of course. For example, the European Union claims that Google is misusing its dominance in search. But while Google certainly is dominant in search this is a contestable monopoly. As soon as Google starts to throw its weight around to the detriment of consumers then consumers will go off and use one of the myriad of alternatives. And new alternatives will arrive as well.\n\nWhere monopolies are natural ones (perhaps because of network effects) or backed by government licence or regulation the situation is different, but a contestable monopoly can almost certainly be left alone. Precisely because as soon as anyone tries to profit from the monopoly that monopoly itself will be contested."}

I spent time with our very sweet dogs. I did some thinking,\" she continued. \"The campaign trail doesn't really encourage reflection. And it's important to sit with your thoughts every now and then and that did help me reconnect with what this whole campaign is about.\"\n\nClinton compared her own ability to take a handful of sick days to that of many Americans who she said are forced to \"either go to work sick or they lose a paycheck.\" She said those Americans, and others \"living on a razor's edge\" with an aging parent who needs help or without the means to afford a college education, are the reason she is running for president.\n\nSpeaking in North Carolina, Clinton made special mention of the law there forcing transgender individuals to use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender on their birth certificate. The law, seen by many as discriminatory, has prompted the NBA, NCAA and Atlantic Coast Conference to move major sporting events out of the state, costs that the former secretary of state said, \"We can't afford.\"\n\n\"I'm running for the LGBT teenager here in North Carolina who sees your governor sign a bill legalizing discrimination and suddenly feels like a second-class citizen,\" she said. \"And if anyone wonders what is the cost of discrimination are, just ask the people and businesses of North Carolina, look at what's happening with the NCAA and the ACC. This is where bigotry leads and we can't afford it, not here, not anywhere else in America.\"\n\nClinton did not address her opponent, Donald Trump, by name but did spend a significant portion of her remarks laying out many of the contrasts she regularly draws with her opponent. She told the crowd that \"I am actually asking Americans to hold me accountable for my ideas and hold my opponent accountable for his.\"\n\n\"You know, I've been involved in politics. It is not an easy business. It can get rough, and I've built up some defenses. When it comes to public service, I am better at the service part than the public part,\" she said. \"People accuse me of all kinds of things. You probably have seen that. But nobody ever accuses me of quitting. And I will never give up. I'll never walk away. No matter how tough the going gets.\""}

He was charged with manslaughter, impaired operation of a motor vehicle causing death, over 80 mgs operation of a motor vehicle causing death and failure to stop at the scene of accident causing death. The incident prompted public debate on whether Kiss acted appropriately, while his blood alcohol level and the fact he fled the scene added layers of complication to the case.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nIt also brought tearful gratitude from Aquino who said Kiss saved her life.\n\nAlicia Aquino (seen here in July) said Anthony Kiss saved her when she was attacked at a bus stop in June. ( Steve Russell/Toronto Star )\n\nThe Crown withdrew the manslaughter charge in court on Tuesday. Michael Lacy, a lawyer for Kiss, told the Star that the Crown will put forward new charges to the court on Nov. 21, which will exclude the manslaughter charge, remove the \"causing death\" element from the other charges, and add a dangerous driving charge. Kiss's maximum penalty with the new charges would be six months in jail, whereas he could have faced a life sentence under the prior charges, Lacy said. \"We support the decision that the Crown came to (Tuesday), our client has always maintained that he acted in lawful self-defence of someone else,\" Lacy said in an interview. \"Someone tragically lost their life here. This has been weighing on our client pretty significantly, and we're glad to see that the Crown didn't persist in prosecuting this case in light of the facts and the legal context.\"\n\nMichelle Adams, Kiss's girlfriend who was with him in the car in June, said the withdrawal of the charge is \"definitely relieving for our family.\"\n\nDario Romero was struck and killed in the early hours of June 7 in west-end Toronto.

The Crown couldn't be reached for comment. In an interview with the Star in July, Aquino alleged that Romero, who she had never seen before, pulled out a knife and tried to slash at her while she was waiting at a bus stop. The 59-year-old Aquino ran into the street and reached the median, realizing soon after that a car had hit Romero. Aquino said Kiss \"put his family on the side to save me.\" She said she yelled \"You're my angel, you saved me!\" at his car as Kiss drove away. Kiss defended his actions in an earlier interview with the Star. \"I didn't want death, that's why I was trying to do this, do what I did, to prevent death,\" Kiss said at the time. Romero's family said he was a wonderful father to a young son, and that he had been diagnosed with extreme paranoia."}
{"text": "It is not known how many people are in this situation in Wellington with estimates ranging from 50 to 200, but the issue of homelessness is more complex and a much wider community problem than is generally understood.\n\nThe NZ Department of Statistics has a definition of homelessness which reflects this complexity: 'Homelessness is defined as living situations where people with no other options to acquire safe and secure housing: are without shelter, in temporary accommodation, sharing accommodation with a household or living in uninhabitable housing.'\n\nIn New Zealand there are a number of different situations people find themselves in, which can be defined as 'homeless'.\n\nPeople who are sleeping out on the streets are clearly homeless. People who have no security in their housing – such as those staying night by night at a shelter or backpackers – are also homeless. People in this situation have no security of tenure in the same way you would if you were flatting and held a tenancy. This lack of security also applies to people who live in boarding houses.\n\nPeople living in unsuitable housing are also considered to be homeless. Living in a garage or sleep-out without electricity or water would fall into this category. If someone has no fixed address, but is 'couch-surfing' or moving between friends or family members, they also come under the New Zealand definition of homelessness.\n\nIt is important to consider the factors behind such homelessness. Many people who experience homelessness in New Zealand have multiple issues and complex needs that have contributed to their homelessness. They may have experienced violence and abuse as a young person or be disconnected from family for other reasons, they may have unmet mental health needs or drug and alcohol addictions, they may have limited education and have been unemployed for extended periods, they may have spent time in prison.\n\nThere is often a misconception that people choose to be homeless and that it represents some kind of freedom. In our experience most people we talk with, express a strong desire to be living in their own home.\n\nWhat are the barriers to achieving housing for all in Wellington?\n\nThe main barrier is limitations around the availability of social housing. The Wellington City Council and Housing New Zealand provide accommodation and there are some supported accommodation options, but demand outstrips availability at present. We would like to see a wider range of housing options available which would include transitional, specialist accommodation tailored to the needs of the individual.\n\nHaving appropriate accommodation is a basic human right but some people require further support to maintain a tenancy. There are skills involved with maintaining a tenancy, and a set of rules to negotiate that can be challenging for some people. If you have limited literacy skills, reading and understanding a tenancy agreement can be difficult. Many people who experience homelessness have complex needs – physical or mental health needs, or addictions – and they also may need good support with these health issues to be able to keep a flat.\n\nBeing homeless can isolate people from Whanau and the wider community while creating a dependence on being part of a homeless or 'streetie' community. Being part of a 'streetie' community can be a barrier to moving out of homelessness.\n\nThe Soup Kitchen is often the first point of contact with an agency for someone experiencing homelessness. Our historical place in the Wellington community is as an entry point to access a safe community to have some basic needs of food and clothing met. At the Soup Kitchen, we provide people with an opportunity to engage with other agencies, for example around accessing health services and housing support."}

{"text": "BW semi-spirit themed tempo/aggro deck. The cards we run aren't individually powerful, most die like flies, but have a lot of potential for a tempo'y deck where you counter, blink or hexproof all of your opponent's attempts of dealing with your prodding.\n\nEach creature does something extra for the greater good, allowing everyone to keep pressure up.\n\nRattlechains: Keep in mind that playing this on the end step gives your opponent the chance to remove it when its Hexproof is still on the stack.\n\nBygone Bishop, Anafenza, Kin-Tree Spirit: Although these are great engines, generally might be a good idea to hold these back until you're up 1-2 mana to protect them with a counterspell / Essence Flux. Generally, losing your guys to removal kills your tempo pretty hard.\n\nThunderclap Wyvern: Surprisingly, since you often have 1-2 flyers out at any point, this can swing the game in your favor in a major way. Depending on your opponent, consider playing this with a counterspell up.\n\nStratus Dancer: Still in testing, this might end up in the sideboard. Not having your guys die as they keep smashing in is what the deck is all about. Doesn't synergize well with Essence Flux though, which is a shame.\n\nNegate: I find it mandatory, at the very least very important to run this as a 4x in main. So far I haven't been able to reliably aggro with this deck, absolutely everything dies to removal, Planeswalkers wreck us and ramp/draw effects quickly leave us behind. 4x Negate is well enough to make it unsafe for your opponent to freely cast their things and allows you to further mess up their tempo by taking out key spells.\n\nSurprisingly, creatures haven't been a problem to this deck at all. 4-5x Silkwrap/Stasis Snare and Reflector Mage are easily enough to keep the board clear enough for you. You don't need to remove everything and a lot of the time the creatures our opponents have aren't a big deal. Gives even further reasons for running Negate.\n\nEssence Flux: Even though Flux doens't seem amazing, it does something against absolutely every deck and it comboes with every card at least decently. Targetting Topplegeist makes it a buff and a combat trick while dodging a removal. To Rattlechains it's a buff and saves up to two targets from removal. With Reflector Mage you get another bounce while dodging. Anafenza, Kin-Tree Spirit gives you more counters on top of more counters. While you may not always want Flux, it's such a flexible card that really holds the deck together.\n\nOjutai's Command: I consider this a resiliency play - The average use I see is bringing Rattlechains back and drawing a card, although countering a big creature and drawing/bringing Rattlechains back is a decent one too. I haven't tested this too much, but it seems to do a lot to fix the biggest problem with this deck - losing Rattlechains before it can be replaced.\n\nAny feedback and criticism especially is welcome, wanted and encouraged! I've previously played both control and aggro, but tempo is a new thing for me. I feel this concept might give me something to practice as this playstyle seems fairly powerful once it's mastered."}
{"text": "A new study of ancient meteorites gave researchers insight into the lifetime of the disk of gas and dust, called the solar nebula, that eventually formed the solar system.\n\nAstronomers have established a new timeline for the solar system that is helping to pinpoint when gas giants Jupiter and Saturn likely formed.\n\nApproximately 4.6 billion years ago, a swirling cloud of hydrogen gas and dust known as the solar nebula collapsed in on itself, giving way to the birth of the sun. The leftover material from this massive explosion then clumped together to form the planets, in a process called core accretion.\n\nA new study suggests Jupiter and Saturn likely took shape within the first 4 million years of the solar system's formation, which further supports the core accretion model, Benjamin Weiss, co-author of the study and professor of planetary sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), told Space.com. [Watch: Our Solar System Built to Scale in Nevada Desert]\n\nWeiss and lead author Huapei Wang, a postdoctoral student at MIT, studied the magnetic orientations of four ancient meteorites called angrites. Rare today, they fell to Earth at different times and were found in Brazil, Argentina, Antarctica and the Saharan desert. This type of space rock acts as a good marker for what the cosmic environment was like during the early days of the solar system.\n\n\"When the solar nebula was present, it generated a substantial magnetic field,\" which would in turn be recorded in meteorites formed during this time, Weiss said. However, he added, the researchers observed little to no remnant magnetization in the oldest of the four angrites, which formed 3.8 million years. That lack of magnetization suggests the gas and debris of the solar nebula had already dissipated by that time, Weiss said — and thus, that the solar system's large-scale structure, including Jupiter and Saturn, must have already been established.\n\n\"Solar systems form out of the condensation of a gaseous nebula. We obtained an accurate and precise age for the lifetime of our solar system's ancient [solar] nebula and the magnetic field,\" Weiss told Space.com. \"We found that the [solar] nebula and [magnetic] field had dispersed 3.8 million years after the formation of the solar system.\"\n\nThe study, published yesterday (Feb. 9) in the journal Science, offers a more precise estimate of the solar nebula's lifetime and will therefore help to determine when and how other planets formed in the solar system, the researchers said.\n\n\"Since the solar nebula lifetime critically affects the final positions of Jupiter and Saturn, it also affects the later formation of the Earth, our home, as well as the formation of other terrestrial planets,\" Wang said in a statement from MIT.\n\nGoing forward, the researchers said they plan to study other primitive asteroid samples to be collected by the Hayabusa 2 spacecraft and NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission, which are expected to return to Earth in the early 2020s.\n\n\"I plan to measure the magnetism of these returned materials, which may contain records of the [solar] nebula from times and locations around the sun different from what we have measured in meteorites,\" Weiss told Space.com.\n\nFollow Samantha Mathewson @Sam_Ashley13.

{"text": "Hillary Clinton's grip on the nomination is hardly threatened by Bernie Sanders winning West Virginia. But she sure is having trouble generating excitement.\n\nAnd the reason has to do with her incremental approach to the presidency. It may be sensible and realistic, but it's a snooze. While Sanders is drawing huge crowds who are feeling the Bern, Clinton is running a position-paper campaign -- that is, when she's not deflecting the latest broadside from Donald Trump.\n\nMaybe that helps explain why she's won 23 states and he's won 19, although hers are much bigger and have given her a virtually insurmountable delegate lead.\n\nClinton's not-so-subtle argument running against Trump is that she's a tested leader who wouldn't do crazy stuff. But much of what she talks about is tweaking government—and tweaking doesn't get the voters' pulse rate up.\n\nTake a release I got the other day on Clinton's \"bold new goal\": Limiting child-care costs to no more than 10 percent of a family's income. She would boost the salaries of child-care workers by creating the Respect And Increased Salaries for Early Childhood Educators (RAISE) initiative. She would increase child care on campuses by spending $235 million more on the Child Care Access Means Parents in School Program (CCAMPIS). She would give student parents scholarships of up to $1,500 through the Student Parents in America Raising Kids (SPARK) program.\n\nAll this sound like more bureaucracy and more federal spending, if not at the wildly expensive Sanders free-college-for-all level.\n\nAs the Washington Post smartly noted the other day, Clinton would crack down on Wall Street by expanding a regulatory form—one that is already 42 pages long and can require up to 300 hours to fill out.\n\nClinton wants to give students a tax credit worth up to $2,500, the paper noted, if they fill out Form 1098-T and Form 8863 and make a series of calculations.\n\nOn some issues, like free trade, Sanders has pulled her to the left. And she veered left the other day on health care, where Bernie famously doesn't think ObamaCare goes far enough and wants a single-payer health system run by the government.\n\nClinton this week came out for a public option that would give those 50 or 55 and up the opportunity to buy into the Medicare program, which would be a large step toward government-run health care—and miles from what she pushed as first lady.\n\nShe is the opposite of a bumper-sticker candidate. She uses many words but rarely utters memorable phrases.\n\nTrump, of course, is having his own stutter-steps on policy. Having proposed a massive tax cut that by some estimates would add up to $10 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, his campaign has asked CNBC anchor Larry Kudlow and former Wall Street Journal writer Stephen Moore for suggestions on bringing down the cost.\n\nIn the end, the election isn't likely to be decided on specific policy positions. He will run to her left on some issues, especially military intervention. Clinton and Trump offer dramatically contrasting styles, one a cautious creature of government, the other a bombastic businessman who denounces government.\n\nMany critics say Trump , who told the New York Times the primaries gave him a \"mandate\" to be provocative, needs to tone it down. But perhaps Hillary needs to dial it up."}

Her office said she was \"pained\" at allegations of her taking over land meant for \"war widows\" and \"distortion of facts by the media.\"\n\nA controversy had broken out over the choice of land, owned by the Defence Ministry, and the scale on which the residence was being readied. An organisation of ex-servicemen in Pune had claimed that two British-era buildings would be knocked down to accommodate the building. Also, it said, the land was earmarked for war widows, an accusation the President's office claimed \"led to a spiralling media attack.\"\n\nNegative reports\n\nOn Friday, the President's Office said: \"She is deeply pained by the allegations about the land-grab.

She has just written to the Prime Minister her decision to forego the Pune accommodation,\" an official said.\n\nIn a statement, the President's Office rebutted allegations that the land was identified for war widows, and cited examples of Ms. Patil's assistance to women and war widows in particular.\n\n\"The President has been reading and watching the unfolding of some fallacious observations regarding the accommodation in Pune, which she was to occupy after relinquishing the office of President. She chose not to react as she has always held herself answerable to the Constitution and her conscience. It was expected that once the facts were made public it would convince the concerned people. But despite clarifications given by the President's Secretariat, it is unfortunate that the misgivings continue to persist …\" the statement read.\n\n\"…What has pained the President the most is the fact that she is now being portrayed by some people as one who, by agreeing to accept a defence accommodation for her post-retirement home, is insensitive to the cause of war widows and ex-servicemen. But facts are to the contrary,\" the statement said.\n\nTo substantiate her concern for war widows, the statement included instances and media reports of how the President intervened and instructed various government agencies to take affirmative action. A case in point is that she, as Rajasthan Governor, instructed all District Collectors to inform her regularly of the progress in resolving the problems of war widows and that she ensured that the newly constructed 'War Widows Hostel and Rehabilitation Centre' in Jaipur was allocated Rs. 2 crore from the Amalgamated Fund of the Governor.\n\nThe President's Office censured the media for continually running \"programmes and polls\" on the issue and \"refusing to accept the clarification that was issued over the controversy.\"\n\n\"Even after it was explained that the land owning agency will be the Ministry of Defence and that the land was never indicated as one earmarked for war widows, there was no end to the fallacious reportage. The President's Secretariat had made it clear that the land to be allotted to her was for use as her post-retirement residence only during her lifetime with no rights of ownership, transfer lease, etc.,\" pointed out the official."}

{"text": "1 of 1 2 of 1\n\nMayor Gregor Robertson and his Vision Vancouver caucus have denied the park board the governance of Hastings Park.\n\nThey also rejected in a special council meeting today (August 1) a proposal to give the board control of all park or green spaces in the 62-hectare public land.\n\nRobertson and his Vision allies approved instead a staff recommendation that essentially retains council's full control over the park, home of the popular summer PNE fair. They also voted to appoint a new board for Hastings Park and the Pacific National Exhibition.\n\nThe current PNE board, whose members are appointed by council, manages the site, except for the Hastings Racecourse, which is operated by the Great Canadian Gaming Corporation, and the park board–run Empire Fields.\n\nIt wasn't a question of council's authority to delegate governance to the park board, a similarly elected civic body. Answering queries from Green councillor Adriane Carr and Non-Partisan Association councillor Elizabeth Ball, city manager Penny Ballem stated that the city actually could do so. In a presentation to council, she stated that the Pacific National Exhibition Enabling and Validating Act passed by the provincial government in 2003 gave council \"absolute discretion\" with the park.\n\nBut Ballem also said at the meeting that allowing the park board to administer Hastings Park isn't the best option.\n\nOn May 27 this year, Vision park-board commissioners Aaron Jasper and Trevor Loke moved a motion to the board asking council to let the park board administer Hastings Park. According to the motion, this will increase not only public access to the park but also transparency in decision-making. It was approved unanimously by the Vision-dominated board.\n\nNPA park commissioner Melissa De Genova noted after today's meeting that council's decision is a \"very interesting\" result.\n\n\"I find it very interesting that the Vision park board had unanimously voted for this along with other commissioners on the board, myself, and [NPA] commissioner [John] Coupar, and their own council didn't vote for this today,\" De Genova told the Georgia Straight in an interview at City Hall.\n\nDe Genova continued: \"Maybe they [Vision] need to caucus more and decide what they're going to do ahead of time.\"\n\nVision councillor Raymond Louie is the current chair of the PNE board. At the council meeting, he filed a motion to adopt a staff recommendation to designate a new board with specific skills.\n\n\"This moves the issue forward in terms of the management of that site,\" Louie told the Straight after the meeting. \"Council has decided that a refined version of the current board is appropriate.\"\n\nLouie added this aligns with a December 2010 approval by council of a $300-million master plan for the park. The plan includes the expansion of the Playland amusement facility and the building of a new convention site.\n\nCity staff will prepare another report to council on how to implement the decision adopted today. A new board is expected to be named in 2014.\n\nThe park board will retain control of Empire Fields.\n\nAfter her motion for park-board control of the entire park was rejected by Robertson and Vision councillors, Coun.Carr tabled another one. It was to give the park board control of the property's Momiji Gardens, Italian Gardens, and the Sanctuary, a natural pond and marsh area, in addition to Empire Fields. This, too, was defeated by Vision."}
{"text": "WHEN Dmitri Shostakovich answered his phone one day in March 1949 he was told to hold on: Comrade Stalin wanted to speak to him. Stalin expressed surprise that the composer had declined an invitation to go to New York for a cultural conference for peace. Shostakovich said that he was \"nauseated\". Stalin affected to believe that he was unwell and said he should see a doctor. But the nausea he had experienced was because none of his music and that of his colleagues Sergei Prokofiev and Aram Khatchaturian had been performed in the Soviet Union for more than a year.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nSilence over the phone: at one end the tyrant, at the other the artist. The tyrant yielded. He said he was not aware that the composers had been censored and he would \"have to correct the comrades\" who had given the illegal order. Next day the luckless censors were punished. Shostakovich went to New York.\n\nWhile Solomon Volkov uses the life of Shostakovich as its thread, the broad theme of his well written book (which is well translated from the Russian) is the experience of gifted artists who have the misfortune to live under a dictatorship. Shostakovich survived because Stalin found it useful to have at his disposal a brilliant and internationally famous composer. He was an advertisement for the culture of the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, he was branded an \"anti-people\" musician. Stalin enjoyed listening to music, but his tastes were simple: he liked a good tune. Shostakovich did not always write simple music.\n\nStalin suspected that he and some of his colleagues were under the influence of western composers such as Arnold Schoenberg and Paul Hindemith, and that their work had become subversive to communism. At the New York peace conference Shostakovich, his voice trembling, read a speech condemning the \"clique of warmongers\" planning aggression against the Soviet Union. He had had the courage to bargain with Stalin to lift the ban on his music. Now he had to submit.\n\nStalin knew the telephone was a useful instrument in his cat and mouse games. In 1930 he called Mikhail Bulgakov, a satirist and one of Russia's most popular writers. Stalin had heard that Bulgakov was thinking of moving abroad and seemed pleased when he said that a Russian writer could not live outside his homeland. Stalin lifted a ban on his work and said they should talk. Stalin never again spoke to Bulgakov and the ban was later imposed. Bulgakov died in 1940, aged 48, apparently stricken by the ban and Stalin's silence. His masterpiece, \"The Master and Margarita\", was not published until 1966. In 1934 Stalin called Boris Pasternak, who was a friend of Osip Mandelstam, jailed for lampooning Stalin in verse. \"We old Bolsheviks never deny our friends,\" Stalin said, then hung up, leaving Pasternak uncertain what he meant, but fearing the worst. For many artists the worst happened: the labour camp, suicide or execution.\n\nMr Volkov shows what happened to creativity in a \"cruel age\". But for an artist all ages are in some form cruel. Tsar Nicholas I, whom Stalin admired, cruelly manipulated Pushkin. In western Europe the church gave work only to painters who accepted its ideology. Even complacent Britain has a culture minister."}

{"text": "6 years ago\n\nGreenville, North Carolina (CNN) – At a Labor Day rally, Republican vice presidential hopeful Rep. Paul Ryan raised the question 'are you better off' and compared President Barack Obama to one-term President Jimmy Carter.\n\n\"You see the president has no record to run on. In fact, every president since the Great Depression who asked Americans to send them into a second term could say that you are better off today than you were four years ago, except for Jimmy Carter and for President Barack Obama,\" said Ryan.\n\n- Follow the Ticker on Twitter: @PoliticalTicker\n\n- Check out the CNN Electoral Map and Calculator and game out your own strategy for November.\n\nThe 1980 presidential race was largely defined by that question after Republican Ronald Reagan posed it rhetorically at the end of his only debate with Democratic incumbent Carter.\n\nRepublican running mates Mitt Romney and Ryan are hammering that same message after prominent Democratic surrogates couldn't give a definitive \"yes\" to the question in various television appearances over the weekend. On Monday Democrats seemed more certain, though still attempted to balance touting improving economic data with the tough realities that many Americans still face.\n\nThe seven-term Wisconsin congressman delivered the GOP's counterattack at a rally before thousands of people at East Carolina University, located nearly 250 miles from Charlotte where the Democratic National Convention is being held.\n\n\"In 1980, under Jimmy Carter, 330,000 businesses filed for bankruptcy. Last year, under President Obama's failed leadership, 1.4 million businesses filed for bankruptcy,\" Paul said. \"Take a look at people who are having a hard time making their mortgage payments, 77,000 delinquent mortgages by the time Jimmy Carter left office. Under President Obama 3 million.\"\n\nRyan's campaign later clarified that he was mentioning total bankruptcy filings, not only business filings.\n\nHe continued, \"So when you take a look at what we are going to hear in Charlotte today, the president can say a lot of things and he will, but he can't tell you that you are better off. Simply put, the Jimmy Carter years look like the good old days compared to where we are right now.\"\n\nObama's re-election team defended the president's record and said their GOP challenger was \"waxing nostalgic about how things were three decades ago\" with the comparisons to Carter.\n\n\"The truth is that under the President's leadership, we've gone from losing 800,000 jobs a month to adding 4.5 million jobs over the last 29 months of private sector job growth,\" Obama campaign spokesman Danny Kanner said in a statement.\n\nRepublicans have long sought to portray Obama as unqualified to the challenge of fixing America's ailing economy, and much of last week's Republican National Convention was spent attacking Obama's record on jobs creation.\n\nRomney's campaign said the theme would continue through the week, leading up to Obama's acceptance of the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday.\n\nA new poll indicates Romney has a slight advantage in North Carolina. Obama narrowly won the battleground state four years ago. He was the first Democrat to carry the Tar Heel state in a presidential election since 1976.\n\n\"Your country needs your help. Eastern North Carolina is so crucial and important to this,\" Ryan told hundreds in one of two overflow crowds on Monday. \"This election is one of the most defining election of our lifetimes, no matter what generation you come from.\"\n\nCNN's Kevin Liptak contributed to this report."}

{"text": "Former Ontario cabinet minister Sandra Pupatello says she won't bring back the legislature until after she wins a seat in the event that she is elected Liberal leader.\n\nPupatello made the announcement Thursday morning in Toronto when she formally declared she would seek to succeed Premier Dalton McGuinty, who is relinquishing his role as Liberal leader.\n\nPupatello's number one priority is job creation, she said at a news conference at Ryerson University.\n\n\"The reason I'm doing this is I want the opportunity to have not just the Ontario government [but] all parties, all of us talking about jobs,\" she said.\n\n\"It's what I haven't heard much of this year and what I think we need to revert back to.\"\n\nMcGuinty prorogued the legislature when he announced his decision to quit, drawing criticism that the move was anti-democratic, had stalled the legislative agenda, and was a move aimed at avoiding controversies swirling around the government.\n\nFinance Minister Dwight Duncan has offered to give up his seat in Windsor-Tecumseh and let Pupatello run in a byelection if she becomes the Liberal leader, she said. Duncan has already endorsed Pupatello for Liberal party leader, as has transportation minister Bob Chiarelli.\n\nPupatello decided not to run for re-election last year, saying it was time for a change. Liberal Teresa Piruzza now holds her former seat of Windsor West.\n\nIf she wins the race, Pupatello would make history as Ontario's first female premier. Her husband, lawyer Jim Bennett, is the former leader of the Newfoundland Liberal Party.\n\nPupatello is the third contender to formally enter the leadership race, following Toronto Centre MPP Glen Murray and Don Valley West MPP Kathleen Wynne, who both launched leadership bids last weekend.\n\nThe Liberal leadership convention is to be held in Toronto on the weekend of Jan. 25. It is not immediately clear how long it would take to hold a byelection after that if Pupatello is elected leader and becomes premier.\n\nPupatello tagged as favourite\n\nLater Thursday, Pupatello will go to a rally and membership drive at Fogolar Furlan Club in Windsor.\n\nUniversity of Windsor political science professor Lydia Miljan said Pupatello has to be the leading candidate to take the leadership at this point.\n\n\"She's sort of the big-name brand. So I think in terms of a race, if it was just those three people, or even some others, she's probably the one most likely to prevail,\" Miljan said \"So I can see her being the leader of the Liberals. The question then is: Can she form a government?\"\n\nHoward Pawley, another University of Windsor political science professor, said Pupatello has distanced herself from the recent gas plant scandal to hit the Liberals.\n\n\"What I think may have caused some others to have just dropped out, she has not been associated with that, so I think that is a positive thing for her,\" Pawley said.\n\nTecumseh Mayor Gary McNamara said he will support Pupatello in her bid.\n\nHe called Pupatello \"well respected\" and \"a dynamo.\"\n\n\"The princess warrior as they call her,\" McNamara said. \"I think she's the right leader to lead the party.\""}
{"text": "That's certainly a possibility. Most of the slab is clearly runes. About half were ones I was pretty confident on before consulting anything.But working through I noticed that some appeared to be backwards or inverted. But then I decided to check different eras for the runes and found a few matches I didn't expect. Even still, there's several that look like they \"fit\" in regards to style etc. but no one has any matches.Which does open up the possibility that more than one region's \"alphabet\" is in play at the same time.I should clarify a thought I kinda failed to expand on in my first post. I decided to attempt to translate as there's a few instances of repeat runes. The idea being that if they were intended to convey the more symbolic meanings (ice, elk, etc.) then I'd expect symbols not to repeat. Sort of like the runes are carved as blessing. The blessing of isaz or ice would only be transcribed once for instance.I have two alternative theories that could help this make sense:It could be a recorded history, in which the runes at the beginning are \"older\" than the last line. This would explain the changing style. It might not even be a history lesson, but as the slab is passed down, a new \"blessing\" or rune is added. In the latter case, a coherent message would be unlikely.Alternatively, it could be sort of like a picture story. Each rune represents the symbolic meaning and is intended to convey a story. So like the first line might have something to do with an ice elkFrom what I have, that would be:Yew Tree*, wealth/cattle, elk, ???, joy, need**???, Sun**, ???, ulcer/torch, Sun, Ice, Need, SunIce, wealth/cattle, year/good year (harvest), man, Tiwaz (a god generally better knows as \"Tyr\"), Ice*From quick research Yggdrasill might have been a yew tree. Seems interesting to say the least. However, this rune would need another line at the top (heading down and right) to be that rune for sure. It looks incomplete, but with the lower line the \"waz\" rune looked closest and it's hard to tell if that top line might have been started. Otherwise, \"ice\" might be reasonable as well.**This one also looks to be possibly incomplete or defaced, so \"need\" is the best guess I have***This rune could be a separate one or part of the first one on the second lineAssuming I have any of this right, it's interesting thematically. We could have a beginning of \"tree,\" some references to nature, joy and need (driving forces/motivations). This is followed by what could be cyclic use of the word \"sun\" which as we all should know makes some sense. And it ends some repetition of ice, possible images of bounty (wealth/cattle and good year/harvest) followed by the rune for man, a god known for bravery and wisdom and ending with ice.EDIT: The \"elk\" rune later turned into the one for man (and changed letters). It is also associated with life.EDIT EDIT: The second rune top line might not be \"fehu\" or \"wealth/cattle.\" It could also be \"berkanan\" which means \"birch\" or other tree associations. So potentially two tree references top line"}

{"text": "The White House is blaming the Obama administration for leaving President Donald Trump without a proper hotel during this week's G20 summit.\n\nEvery top-shelf lodging was already booked by the time the Trump White House began making inquiries – but that, two White House officials say, is because their predecessors never booked rooms for an American delegation.\n\nThe G20's northern Germany summit was announced in February 2016, when Obama was still president and Trump was considered a long-shot hope to take the White House.\n\n'Obama's people left everyone high and dry,' one current official said on Friday. 'They didn't care enough to make sure whoever was president would have a place to stay.'\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel (right) has a swanky block of hotel rooms for this week's G20 summit in Hamburg, but President Donald Trump (left) was left staying in a government-owned guest house because the Obama administration never thought ahead and reserved rooms when the conference was announced in early 2016\n\nThe guest house of the Hamburg senate is where Trump has been forced to lay his head, but his aides insist it was the previous admininstration's job to do the 'advance' work in anticipation of a new president\n\nObama, now a private citizen and popular on the speaking circuit, would also be blamed for causing the same problem if Hillary Clinton had succeeded him\n\nThe White House is remaining officially mum about where the president is laying his head, and why. Spokespersons did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe officials who talked to DailyMail.com, including one with direct knowledge of White House travel and 'advance' operations, spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nBuzzfeed reported Thursday that Trump is staying in the government-owned Senate guest house in Hamburg instead of at a 5-star property like the luxury lodgings he owns.\n\nThe website published a list of which international delegations had snagged which hotels, including Russian president Vladimir Putin's group at the Park Hyatt and UK Prime Minister Theresa May's group at Le Meridien.\n\nThe leaders of China and Italy apparently reserved space at the Grand Elysée; the Indian and Canadian prime ministers are staying at the Atlantic Kempinski, along with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nDailyMail.com contacted those four hotels and another six mentioned in the Buzzfeed report.\n\nHamburg's Park Hyatt, where Russian president Vladimir Putin's delegation is staying, was already fully booked before Trump won the November 2016 election, hotel staff said Friday\n\nThe leaders of China and Italy blocked off space at the Grand Elysée, which was also never an option for the White House because it was reserved more than 9 months ago\n\nStaff at eight of them confirmed that they were completely booked by the time America's 2016 election was held in early November. the other two declined to comment.\n\n'The funny thing,' a second Trump White House official said Friday, 'is that the U.S. delegation probably also wouldn't have had hotel rooms if Hillary Clinton had become president. It was already too late by Election Day.'\n\n'But I bet even if Hillary had to sleep in a youth hostel,' the official added, 'no one in the press would say it was her staff's fault.'\n\nTrump's travel staff originally sought to accommodate him at the Four Seasons hotel. But Saudi Arabia's King Salman, who feted Trump last month in Riyadh, already had the entire hotel blocked off for himself and his entourage."}

Though nobody knows what this 'true battle' really is, all they can do is follow the training program and protect their base from the 'invaders'.Together with his assigned navigator , Len, they have to go through various missions in order to survive. However, the suspicious risen when not only the pilot who fail the mission disappeared, but also their personal navigators as well. Will he succeed in all the missions and survive long enough to find out the truth? And just what is this \"U.S.G\" project he seems to be into?- Unique \"Strength & Weakness\" battle system in shmup game.- Leveling up your character and develop your character to fit your playstyle.- Not good at shooting game? Don't worry! Set the difficulty to fit your skill anytime during the game!There are five elements of attack in the game, which are : Non-elemental, Fire, Ice, Electric and Wind. Each enemy has their strengths and weaknesses that will cause them to react differently to these five elements. For example, enemies who are strong against fire will take less damage from fire attack. But if they are weak against ice, they'll take at least double damage from ice attack.However, you can only pick two choices of weapons into the mission. So it's a nice idea to save before you enter any mission.The bonus of exploiting an enemy's weakness does not only do more damage, but also there's a chance that the attack will knock them down. When an enemy is down, the enemy will be vulnerable and do nothing for a short period of time, leaving you more time to retaliate, or help decreases number of bullets on the screen.Everytime you attack or kill an enemy, you'll recieve some rave point which you can see the progress in the rave guage. Once the guage is full, you'll get one R-stock for spending to use DRD.DRD is a defensive device that you can select one and only one before entering the mission. This range from a sheild, protecting you from bullets for a short period of time, to a shockwave that will wipe out all bullets in the screen.Knock down an enemy will also give you rave point bonus.Once you killed an enemy, all the bullets it shoot that are still on the screen will become your bonus exp. Thus, one strategy to level up quickly and go for highscore is to have most bullets possible on the screen before killing off any enemy.Also, if your ship overlap with enemies or bullets, but doesn't hit your hitbox, you'll get extra score and exp also.

{"text": "In a disturbing incident in Tennessee, a 22-year-old married man allegedly posed as a senior transfer student at one of Memphis' best boys basketball teams, leading to the squad's elimination from the state playoffs.\n\n22-year-old McKinzie Sewell competing in high school basketball at Ridgeway High — BeRecruited More\n\nAs reported by Memphis CBS affiliate WREG and the Memphis Commercial Appeal, McKinzie Sewell used a fake transcript to enroll at Memphis (Tn.) Ridgeway High, where he starred on the boys basketball team. Sewell's transcript was allegedly submitted to the school by his wife, who posed as his mother so he would have a back story to explain why he was enrolling at the school.\n\nSewell never previously graduated from a high school, but he earned a GED. Somewhat ironically, he wore the number 22 for Ridgeway, identical to his age. He also set up a BeRecruited profile under his name portraying himself as an 18-year-old senior at Ridgeway.\n\nIt has not been confirmed whether Sewell registered with the school for the fall or winter term. Regardless, the fact that he had taken the court at all immediately made the entire Ridgeway squad ineligible for the state playoffs, just after the school had reached the regional final round of the tournament.\n\n\"It has come to our attention that an ineligible player played in the closing minutes of the Region 8-AAA semi-finals against Whitehaven High School,\" Memphis Community Schools said in a statement. \"Ridgeway High School reported this information to the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association [TSSAA]. Ridgeway HS has forfeited that game and has been removed from the tournament playoffs.\"\n\n[More from Prep Rally: No exaggeration: The craziest buzzer-beater you've ever seen]\n\nThat removal has effectively ended the season for a group of players who had overcome significant hardship to reach the state semis. Most notably, one of the team's assistant coaches was killed in his home in February.\n\nNow the team will have to stay home, with parents of the players furious at the Memphis Community Schools' inability to catch Sewell before he had suited up for a game.\n\n\"It's absurd the administration has failed,\" Adrian Jones, a Ridgeway parent told WREG. \"They're not keeping the kids safe. They're not doing checks and balances.\"\n\nSewell is not the first imposter to strike the prep hoops ranks. In 2010 a Haitian 22-year-old named Guerdwich Montimere played the high school basketball season at Odessa (Tx.) Permian High. He was eventually caught and sentenced to three years in prison because of a relationship with a teenager while he was at the school.\n\nNow Sewell joins the ranks of Montimere and others in the ranks of disturbing prep imposters who have threatened the safety of the teens they compete with and against.\n\nWant more on the best stories in high school sports?

{"text": "A group of protesters at Amherst College in Massachusetts has released a set of demands that include punishing students who produced a poster celebrating free speech by subjecting them to re-education for the sake of \"racial and cultural competency.\"\n\nIn response to ongoing protests at the University of Missouri, which saw an attack on journalists Monday trying to cover the event, some students at Amherst this week put up small posters on campus. The posters read \"In memoriam of the true victim of the Missouri protests: Free Speech (1776-2015),\" and included a short \"eulogy\" which reads as follows:\n\nWho is constrained by the invisible barriers of our generation's safe spaces. Censored for the open forum of non-conflicting opinions. Trod upon to build a community of comfort. And violently persecuted for a safer, less vitriolic world. Let us honor the life of the first amendement, and the heroes that it protected: Journalists, Educators, Philosophers, and Free Thinkers everywhere.\n\nThe poster never mentions race, and ends with a short quip \"If you want to protest this sign, feel free. Because that's why the First Amendment exists.\"\n\nBut Amherst activists want to do far more than proest. They want the people responsible for the poster punished, along with those responsible for producing signs which said \"All Lives Matter.\" A coalition of more than 50 campus groups held a \"sit-in\" Thursday night, which led to them producing a lengthy list of demands that includes punishing anybody who made the signs:\n\n\"President [Biddy] Martin must issue a statement to the Amherst College community at large that states we do not tolerate the actions of student(s) who posted the 'All Lives Matter' posters, and the 'Free Speech' posters,\" the list of demands says. \"Also let the student body know that it was racially insensitive to the students of color on our college campus and beyond who are victim to racial harassment and death threats; alert them that Student Affairs may require them to go through the Disciplinary Process if a formal complaint is filed, and that they will be required to attend extensive training for racial and cultural competency.\"\n\nLet that sink in: A poster celebrating the First Amendment was \"racially insensitive\" and requires \"extensive training for racial and cultural competency.\"\n\nStudents demand a great deal more as well. They request that Amherst's honor code be updated to include \"reflect a zero-tolerance policy for racial insensitivity and hate speech,\" meaning students could be punished and perhaps expelled for racial insensitivity, which apparently includes defending free speech. They also demand that the school suppress its unofficial sports mascot Lord Jeff, whom they say has an \"inherent racist nature.\"\n\nThe demands are endorsed by students from more than 50 Amherst student groups, including the Black Students Union, Amherst United Left, and Amherst Christian Fellowship.\n\nAmherst has been given until Nov. 18 to respond to the student protesters. If the school considers any punishment of faculty, staff, or administrators who support them, they warn it will \"result in an escalation of our response.\"\n\nFollow Blake on Twitter\n\nSend tips to blake@ dailycallernewsfoundation.org.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

{"text": "Hillary Clinton doesn't believe unborn children should have any Constitutional rights — so it should come as no surprise to pro-life voters that she laughed, stood by and said nothing as someone introducing her at a campaign rally removed \"Under God\" from the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nAs the Washington Free Beacon reports:\n\nDuring the introduction for Hillary Clinton at a rally in Blackwood, New Jersey, Susan Shin Angulo, a member of the Camden County Board of Freeholders, messed up the Pledge of Allegiance, a part of which she used in her speech. \"Only Hillary can bring us together, as one nation,\" she started. She then sputtered before skipping the \"under God\" portion of the pledge. \"In-dis-visible, with liberty and justice for all!\" she finished. Meanwhile, Clinton just stood there, smiling and nodding.\n\nWatch a clip of what happened:\n\nSIGN THE PLEDGE! We Oppose Hillary Clinton!\n\nDuring an interview on The View recently Hillary Clinton said an unborn child just hours before delivery should have no Constitutional rights. Her comments came just days after Clinton said unborn children simply do not have any Constitutional rights, which would include the right to life.\n\nIn February, Clinton defended partial-birth abortions: \"My husband vetoed a very restrictive legislation on late-term abortions, and he vetoed it at an event in the White House where we invited a lot of women who had faced this very difficult decision, that ought to be made based on their own conscience, their family, their faith, in consultation with doctors. Those stories left a searing impression on me,\" she continued.\n\nClinton has said more taxpayer money needs to go to the Planned Parenthood abortion business and Clinton demonstrated her unyielding commitment to abortion and the Planned Parenthood abortion business, accepting their endorsement during a pro-abortion rally — saying she would be the abortion business' president.\n\n\"I will always defend Planned Parenthood and I will say consistently and proudly, Planned Parenthood should be funded, supported and protected, not undermined, misrepresented and demonized,\" Clinton said. \"As your president, I will always have your back.\"\n\nAt a speech to the Women in the World Conference in April 2015, Hillary Clinton argued, \"Far too many women are denied access to reproductive health care (aka. abortion) and safe childbirth, and laws don't count for much if they're not enforced,\" In order to expand worldwide access to abortion, she suggested that \"deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed.\"\n\nIn May 2015, the U.S. House passed the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act to protect unborn babies 20 weeks and older from excruciating late abortions. In addition to a statement slamming House lawmakers for advancing the bill, Clinton tweeted, \"When it comes to women's health, there are two kinds of experts: women and their doctors. True 40+ years ago, true today.\"\n\nAt a presidential forum at Drake University, Clinton called ending the life of another human being a \"fundamental human right.\"\n\nThe first order of business for Clinton and her friends at the abortion company is to force Americans to pay for abortions with their tax dollars by attempting to overturn the Hyde Amendment, which has protected Americans from funding most all abortions since the late 1970s.

{"text": "Oldak is the greatest inventor of the Dorgeshuun, an advanced tribe of cave goblins. He spends most of his time in his lab at the bottom floor in his house in north-western Dorgesh-Kaan, just north of the bank.\n\nOldak is known for his excellent magical skills, a trait uncommon amongst the cave goblins. He seems to view magic somewhat like a scientist; his home is filled with strange metal instruments and littered with cables. Only after Dorgesh-Kaan's opening was he able to do much; the lack of available runes in the hidden city made things difficult.\n\nPlayers with 40 Invention can speak with him to start with the Cave goblin tech tree. There is an Inventor's workbench in his lab.\n\nContents show]\n\nMoving-over-distance spheres Edit\n\nOldak will make players moving-over-distance spheres, if provided with un-noted molten glass and two law runes. He then proceeds to coat the molten glass in the crushed law runes, and when the glass is hardened, the orb has magical properties. When broken, the orbs will teleport players to one of several random areas in Dorgesh-Kaan.\n\nDuring Another Slice of H.A.M., he will also make players goblin village spheres. After the quest is complete, he will make players these spheres in the same way as Dorgesh-Kaan spheres.\n\nDuring and after the Land of the Goblins quest, a plain of mud sphere can transport players to the Goblin Cave located south-east of the Fishing Guild.\n\nAfter The Chosen Commander quest, Oldak will create bandos throne room spheres that teleport players to the Bandos's throne room accessed during the quest. The throne room offers an Agility course and several attackable statues.\n\nSkill boosts Edit\n\nAlso, if a player inquires about the magic he has discovered, the cave goblin will explain some of his more recent discoveries, which will temporarily raise, or lower the player's Magic or Runecrafting skill by up to two levels.\n\nTalk to Oldak. Ask, \"What have you discovered?\" You will get a different response depending on what skill is affected.\n\nRunecrafting boost - Oldak lectures you on the construction of runes and you find yourself thinking about Runecrafting with greater clarity.\n\nMagic boost - Oldak lectures you on the magic energies stored within runes and you find yourself thinking about Magic with greater clarity.\n\nThis is not possible during Land of the Goblins while the player is supposed to rescue Zanik to ask about that.\n\nThieving chest Edit\n\nOn the top floor of his house is a chest which can be opened with a lockpick if a player has a Thieving level of 52. The chest can be opened once every 3–5 minutes, and the loot obtainable from it is different from the loot of the other chests around the city.\n\nTrivia Edit\n\nOldak was meant to sound like a cross between Carl Sagan and Doc Brown. [1]\n\nOut of the various instruments in his lab, there is a \"Thingymajig\" which resembles a stereotypical electric arc; an \"Oojimafilp\", which resembles a Van de Graaff generator which it also references with the examine text \"Hair-raising\"; as well as a \"Magic ball\" that bears a resemblance to a Plasma globe. All of them are common displays in science museums.\n\nReferences Edit"}
{"text": "Confirming the identity of Jon Snow's mother is huge for any Game of Thrones fan, but we don't know everything just yet. Just as the R+L=J theory has always held, Jon's mother is Lyanna Stark, his father is Rhaegar Targaryen, and Ned is his uncle. What did Lyanna whisper to Ned on Game of Thrones ? Her dying words could fill in the remaining pieces to the puzzle.\n\nHBO's subtitles only give you that she \"whispers\" and then, \"If Robert finds out he'll — you know he will.\" That's not much. However, with the volume up and my headphones and a few close readings, there is only one major piece of information missing. This is what Lyanna says to Ned:\n\nNo, no water. Listen to me, Ned. His name is ... if Robert finds out, he'll kill him. You know he will. You have to protect him. Promise me, Ned. Promise me.\n\nThat's a little more, but wait — what is Jon Snow's real name? I think that's the only bit that's unclear. It's possible that she was saying \"his name is Targaryen\" or \"his name is Jon,\" but since she was completely muffled in that moment, I think the reveal of his true name must be significant. It's possible that Ned renamed the baby Jon, which is unassuming, but his mother named him something else. The only Targaryen name which starts with a \"J\" that I can find is Jaehaerys — which doesn't seem to fit Jon's personality one bit, if you ask me.\n\nHowever, if you watch Lyanna's lips when she's whispering, it doesn't look like the name she says starts with \"J\" at all. It's almost certainly not Jon. It seems likely that Ned named him after his former guardian, Jon Arryn. I don't think Lyanna gave him a Stark name, because Ned seems to understand the significance of Jon just from his hearing his first name. In my opinion, that could also clue Ned in to the fact (which is still just a popular, unconfirmed theory at this point) that Rhaegar and Lyanna ran away together. If she had been kidnapped and raped, I feel she would have given her baby a Stark name. What if she said \"His name is Azor Ahai\"? That would be wild, and pretty ambitious for a baby name. Rhaegar's children with Elia were named Aegon and Rhaenys. So, looking at Targaryen names, I am going to toss Aerion, Aerys, and Rhaegon into consideration — though my main guess is something like Rhaegard, which combines a bit of House Stark and House Targaryen.\n\nNow, will Jon Snow accept a new name? Probably not. Way back in Season 1, Tyrion Lannister gave him the advice to \"Never forget who you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor, and it can never be used to hurt you.\" Rhaegar Targaryen was married to Elia Martell at the time of Jon's conception, so he's still a bastard even if he is a Targaryen. After all that he's been through, I don't think Jon Snow would be willing to change the name that has defined him in so many ways.\n\nImages: Helen Sloan/courtesy of HBO; Giphy"}

We had never seen it before and had never seen the terms it used,\" said one.\n\nAnother said it was \"completely unfair... impossible to do\".\n\nThis meant there was no choice, students had to answer the other two questions. Even this was not straightforward as one of the remaining questions asked candidates to compare two economic studies, one of which had not been part of their course.\n\nOn Twitter, students called it an \"absolute disgrace\", \"an exam from hell\", \"unethical\", \"poorly set and horrible beyond words after sleepless nights\".\n\nAdjustments 'considered'\n\nAs well as students taking a BSc in economics, the paper was sat by students taking a joint BA honours with other subjects, such as politics.\n\nThe joint honours students were particularly badly affected as many lacked the mathematical background of the BSc students.\n\nThe university said an internal review was under way and the results would be fed back to students.\n\nThe head of the economics department, Prof Andy Dickerson, said not all the questions were mathematically based.\n\n\"Those that had mathematical content were set at a level consistent with the maths taught to all economics students, including those on dual degrees.\n\n\"All questions were based on topics taught in the course and for which further reading was provided. One question used a term that they may not have encountered previously, but to avoid any misunderstanding, the term was defined precisely in the question in terms of concepts used in the module.\"\n\nThe department also said the exam would be second-marked internally and moderated by external examiners.\n\n\"All module marks are compared across modules at each level to ensure comparability.\n\n\"If there are large discrepancies, adjustments are considered by the examination board.\""}
{"text": "The Southern Poverty Law Center Has \"documented\" nearly 1,000 hate crimes by Trump supporters against minorities since the election, which they admit are unproven. I wonder if they have amended that number to remove the hate crimes they can prove are hoaxes. Like this one from Philadelphia where a black man was busted for vandalizing cars with pro-Trump, racist, and anti-Semitic graffiti.\n\nPhilly.com reports:\n\nA 58-year-old South Jersey man has been arrested and charged with vandalizing several vehicles and homes in South Philadelphia on the day after the presidential election, police announced Thursday. William Tucker, of the unit block of Hemmings Way in Lawnside, Camden County, has been arrested and charged in the early-morning Nov. 9 incidents on the 900 block of South Sixth Street, at the border of Bella Vista and Queen Village, police said.\n\nThe graffiti, which was on cars, store fronts, and walls ranged from Trump's name to swastikas. One black woman's car was defaced with \"Trump Rules\" and \"Black Bitch.\" Residents were so offended that white people were apologizing and offering the black woman to pay for the graffiti removal.\n\nOne indignant resident who saw the offending tag said, \"If we were to put any president's name on that wall, it wouldn't be an offensive thing, but unfortunately, Trump has made himself synonymous with hateful rhetoric.\"\n\nBut as it turned out, it wasn't Trump or his supporters with the hateful rhetoric, it was a black man who was trying to make it seem like the President-elect was inspiring a wave of hatred across the country.\n\nNot only was Tucker captured on surveillance video committing some of these acts, an anonymous tipster ratted him out to the police. He was charged with 4 counts of criminal mischief and amazingly released on his own recognizance. Are you kidding me? He perpetrated a hate crime hoax and did thousands of dollars in damages and they just let him go with a summons?\n\nImagine if they had arrested a white man for this crime. That fictional racist would get slapped with multiple felonies with hate crime enhancements and would be looking at a six-figure bail. There would also be a Justice Department civil rights investigation with additional charges. On top of all that, it would be a major-outrager national news story instead of a brief mention in a local paper.\n\nTo the SPLC, who are trying desperately to verify all of the Trump-inspired hate crimes they claim are destroying the country, they can take these ones off of the list:\n\nRacist pro-Trump graffiti in Philadelphia was done by a black man.\n\nBlack woman in Kentucky who said white boys in Trump shirts threw rocks at her was lying.\n\nIn Chicago a lesbian faked a series of Trump-related threatening letters to herself.\n\nA black man in Massachusetts lied about being attacked by white Trump supporters.\n\nA black woman in Delaware lied about white Trump supporters threatening her with a gun.\n\nAn Asian woman in Minnesota lied about being attacked by a group of Trump-suppporting white men who told her to leave the country.\n\nA Muslim woman in Louisiana lied about being beaten by a white man in a Trump hat.\n\nReally, the SPLC could take all of their hate crimes off of the list, for the simple fact that there is no evidence that any of them actually happened. They won't however because they are in the business of scaring people with fake racism.\n\nFollow Brian Anderson on Twitter"}
{"text": "247Sports\n\nOver the last decade, we've seen a surge of freshmen running backs making a major impact in the world of college football.\n\nFrom former South Carolina star Marcus Lattimore and former Auburn BCS National Championship Game offensive MVP Michael Dyer to last year's stud crop that consisted of Leonard Fournette (LSU), Nick Chubb (Georgia), Dalvin Cook (Florida State), Samaje Perine (Oklahoma) and Royce Freeman (Oregon), teams are more dependent on youngsters than ever before.\n\nFlorida freshman Jordan Scarlett isn't in that company yet, but he's one step closer.\n\nPart of the reason is the transfer of the rising sophomore running back and Birmingham Bowl MVP Adam Lane. Florida announced the transfer of the Winter Haven, Florida, native on Sunday.\n\nLane rushed for 181 yards and a touchdown a year ago, including 109 in the bowl win over East Carolina.\n\nNow Scarlett has ascended to the consensus No. 2 spot on the running back depth chart behind established starter Kelvin Taylor. In just a few short practices, Scarlett—a 5'11\", 210-pounder from Fort Lauderdale, Florida—has been wildly impressive, according to Nick de la Torre of GatorCountry.com:\n\nThat's huge, because he has all of the skills to be a superstar once he gets his chance to shine.\n\nThe former Florida Atlantic and Miami 4-star commit was one of the prize signings of first-year head coach Jim McElwain's first recruiting class in Gainesville, and McElwain's ability to use multiple running backs throughout the year should help Scarlett earn significant snaps this fall.\n\n\"You're going to need three guys at least to go through the year with,\" McElwain said, according to quotes released by Florida. \"So what you hope to do is to find that guy that has the hot hand in the fourth quarter, okay. He's still fresh based on what you've done, and now let that guy kind of finish the game. That's kind of how we like to do it. Obviously, that has a lot to do with the development of those young guys.\"\n\nMake no mistake, the pressure is on Scarlett to be a key contributor from the moment toe meets leather in the season opener versus New Mexico State.\n\nRegardless of what you hear about the progress of the quarterback battle between redshirt freshman Will Grier and true sophomore Treon Harris, the Gators will be a run-first, power team. They're going to establish the run and then work off play action.\n\nWith quarterback and offensive line questions, it's tough to simply rely on the passing game undergoing an immediate turnaround, which means depth and creativity from McElwain and offensive coordinator Doug Nussmeier out of the running back position is paramount to the success of the 2015 Gators.\n\nScarlett was going to be a big part of that equation regardless of Lane's status, but now his development needs to be accelerated a bit in a transition year for the Gator program.\n\nHe has the talent, but now he has to grow up and learn the system in a hurry.\n\nQuotes were obtained firsthand unless otherwise noted.

{"text": "Another month, another report on 3D movies that will make uncomfortable reading for the studios, cinema chains and hardware manufacturers trying to convince consumers to add an extra dimension to their viewing.\n\nBrandwatch's new 3D Films Report analyses social-media reaction to movies this summer, considering comments on both 3D in general, plus three specific 3D releases: Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides; Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows PtII and Green Lantern.\n\nIt found a clear swing in filmgoer opinion from positive anticipation of the 3D movie experience to negative post-viewing reflection, though most viewers still enjoyed the movie.\n\nSpecific complaints include: paying a premium to watch in 3D; uncomfortable 3D glasses; inappropriate use of 3D; both underwhelming and/or heavy-handed use of 3D effects; and headaches.\n\nThere also appears to be a growing backlash against 3D films that were shot in 2D but converted post-production; consumers feel they're not getting 'the real deal'.\n\nInterestingly, Avatar - specifically realised in 3D - is still held up by most people as the best example of 3D; two years on, it hasn't been surpassed.\n\nPositive vs negative\n\nIt all starts well for 3D, the report reveals, with a range of positive statements about looking forward to seeing the movie (40%) through to the prospect of seeing a favourite actor in 3D (10%).\n\nHowever, negative comments are more specific, including: 3D adds nothing/is a waste of time (29%); 3D is over-used/too heavy handed (20%); ticket price is too high (18%); 3D glasses are uncomforable/'naff' (18%); these films aren't genuine 3D (10%).\n\nSimon Pegg says\n\nThe report also notes that many highly influential voices in the social-media world have spoken out about 3D. For example, despite currently being one of the stars of a 3D release (Tintin), Simon Pegg has regaled his 1.5 million Twitter followers with comments about how marketing execs 'inflict' 3D on movies, and that '3D is novel, not evolutionary\". Film critic, Mark Kermode's sceptical stand on 3D is also regularly noted.\n\nReaction to specific movies\n\nBut it's not all bad news for 3D movie makers - the right film and the right treatment can still provoke a largely positive response, even if enthusiasm does wane along the way.\n\nFor example, comments about Green Lantern in 3D started off at 83% positive, 15% negative and 2% neutral before viewing. After viewing that declined to 54% positive - more than half the viewers - and negatve remained at 15%.\n\nThe latest Pirates of the Caribbean installment showed a larger fall-off in positive feel - from 85% to 52% – but a massive rise in negative feel, from 13% to 45%. Still, that means more than half of viewers enjoyed the experience.\n\nSimilarly, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II was seen as a positive 3D experience by 56% of viewers, with 40% negative - a switch from the 73% positive/25% negative split pre-viewing.\n\nSo, what do you think - does this echo your own 3D viewing experience?

{"text": "Since the first day of this year, thousands of otherwise law-abiding Connecticut residents - at least 20,000 and maybe as many as 100,000 - have become criminals. They have broken a new state law that required owners of military-style rifles and high capacity magazines to register them with the State Police by last Dec. 31. Not quite 50,000 rifles were registered by the deadline but that could be as little as 15 percent of the now illegal assault rifles in Connecticut, according to the state-based National Shooting Sports Foundation, which is familiar with industry sales.\n\n\nSome of these rifle owners - there's no way of knowing for sure how many - may not have been aware that the rifles and high capacity magazines they had owned for months or years now have to be registered. Connecticut lawmakers enacted that requirement because they believe it is necessary to keep track of these extra-lethal weapons that can no longer be legally purchased in the state.\n\n\nOther gun owners simply missed the deadline, while some are deliberately choosing to disobey the law.\n\n\nWe do not doubt that many sincerely believe the measure, passed after the Newtown massacre, should never have become a Connecticut law because it violates their Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. But that doesn't give them the right to disobey it. The law's constitutionality is a matter for the courts to determine, not the individual gun owner. In the meantime, he or she must obey the law or face the consequences of breaking it.\n\n\nFailure to register the rifle or its high capacity magazines is a Class D felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. A sentence of this magnitude would be unheard of for a first-time offender, but committing a felony is serious and a blot on an otherwise clean record that would not be without consequences.\n\n\nGov. Dannel P. Malloy indicated a willingness last week to work with those who wish to obey the law when he announced the state would accept applications that were mailed in good faith before the New Year's Eve deadline but did not reach the state because of circumstances beyond the applicant's control - like the noon closing of post offices on that day.\n\n\nThis would, however, impact only a few hundred individuals now in violation of the law. The administration appears willing to talk about other ways to get more gun owners registered and reduce the number of Connecticut citizens who now find themselves unconvicted felons. The governor has said he is ready to discuss the issue, but it could take legislative action to extend the registration.\n\n\nSince the intent of the law is to create a record and track these weapons, not to make criminals of gun owners, we would urge the administration and the legislature to find some way to provide a bit more time for registration.\n\n\nNo one should take any joy in having 20,000 or 100,000 citizens suddenly becoming criminals. If possible, a way should be be found to allow these gun owners a chance to reconsider and follow the law.\n\n\nAs to those who sincerely believe the requirement is wrong, we respect their beliefs, but that does mean they can disobey this law or any law.\n\n\nThe Day editorial board meets regularly with political, business and community leaders and convenes weekly to formulate editorial viewpoints.

{"text": "The California Supreme Court has affirmed the death penalty given to a Laguna Hills man who was convicted of kidnapping, sexually assaulting and murdering a 23-year-old Newport Beach woman in 1991, and then keeping her handcuffed body in a freezer for three years as a trophy.\n\nIn a unanimous decision published on Thursday, the Supreme Court found that John Famalaro, now 60, received a fair trial in Orange County in 1997 for the murder of Denise Huber, who was abducted when her car broke down on the Corona del Mar 73 Freeway, late at night on June 23, 1991.\n\nOrange County Deputy District Attorney Christopher Evans argued during Famalaro's headline-making trial in 1997 that Famalaro took Huber to a warehouse in Laguna Hills, where he sexually assaulted her and bludgeoned her to death.\n\nFamalaro then stored the nude, battered and handcuffed body in a freezer he bought a few days after the slaying, and kept it for three years while Huber's parents and friends frantically searched for her.\n\nHis scheme was uncovered in July 1994 when sheriff's deputies in Yavapai County, Ariz., investigated a report of a stolen rental truck, and came across the freezer in the back of the truck, powered by an extension cord from the small house where Famalaro was living.\n\nDeputies cut through a padlock on the freezer and three layers of plastic trash bags before they found a naked human body, frozen solid in a fetal position with the hands secured behind the back with metal handcuffs. It was Denise Huber.\n\nFamalaro's arrest and subsequent trial drew intense media attention as he was extradited from Arizona and tried in Orange County. His trial was covered by newspapers, radio station and television stations. It became a true crime book, \"Cold Storage,\" written by Garden Grove author Dan Lasseter. And it was listed by The Orange County Register in 2009 as one of the most notorious cases in county history.\n\nFamalaro's appellate court attorneys claimed that he was denied a fair trial in part because of that media attention. They argued that his trial should have been moved out of Orange County because of prejudicial pre-trial publicity that allegedly contaminated the jury pool.\n\nBut the Supreme Court, in a 56-page decision authored by Justice Joyce Kennard, disagreed. They found that Orange County Superior Court Judge John J. Ryan properly conducted the jury selection process properly and qualified a jury that was fair and unbiased.\n\n\"True, the jury selection process indicated that defendant's case was well known in Orange County, and that there was considerable community sentiment that he was guilty of murdering Denise and should be executed for that crime,\" Kennard wrote. \"Here, our independent review … shows that the selection process resulted in a panel of jurors untainted by the publicity surrounding this case, and we see no evidence that any of them held biases that the selection process failed to detect.\"\n\nThe decision to affirm Famalaro's death sentence does not mean that his potential execution is imminent in California, where there is an informal moratorium on capital punishment while lawyers battle the legality of lethal injection and as a means of execution.\n\nHis defense team will also now take their appeals to the Supreme Court, a process that could take years to resolve.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Famalaro will remain on death row at San Quentin prison, one of 58 killers from Orange County sentenced to death\n\nContact the writer: lwrlborn@ocregister.com or 714-834-3784"}
{"text": "Internet heavyweights Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Netflix are joining at least 80,000 other websites to protest the Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) proposed rollback of network neutrality (net neutrality) today, urging users to send comments to the regulatory agency demanding net neutrality's preservation.\n\nBut what, exactly, is net neutrality? And why does everyone care about it all of a sudden?\n\nAs of now, net neutrality is shorthand for the internet as we know it. It's the idea and tradition that internet service providers (ISPs) will not discriminate or charge differently based on content, website, or platform–and essentially that ISPs must provide the same version of the internet to everyone regardless of their location, political opinion, or internet consumption habits.\n\nThough generally understood as more of a principle than anything, it wouldn't be entirely inaccurate to say that it's the present state of the law. The FCC officially regulates ISPs and in 2015 classified them as \"common carriers\" under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act and Section 706 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act in order to preserve the neutrality of the network we call the internet.\n\nCommon carrier status effectively means ISPs are treated similar to phone companies and other utilities; therefore they must keep the internet an open and neutral gateway to the content contained online. Effectively, this means ISPs can't speed up or slow down access to certain content or throttle users' bandwidth just because they feel like it.\n\nHere are a few examples of what a compromised (i.e. non-neutral) network might look like:\n\n1. The illicit behavior of Comcast in 2007. The ISP was secretly throttling the bandwidth of users who were uploading to peer-to-peer file sharing services like BitTorrent; once this behavior was discovered by the FCC, Comcast was ordered to stop.\n\n2. The illegal 2004 activity of Madison River Communications, a phone company which was blocking users' ability to access competitor Vonage's internet-based phone services. They were fined $15,000 by the FCC.\n\n3. AT&T got in on the unlawful action in 2012: limiting access to Apple's FaceTime app to those customers who purchased a more expensive data plan. They eventually backed down before the FCC was forced to act.\n\n4. Not to be outdone, Verizon in 2007 decided to censor pro-choice text messages sent across their SMS network. This decision was swiftly criticized across the political spectrum–and then swiftly reversed.\n\nNet neutrality, therefore, in its present state, is a regulation intended to curb potential abuses of corporate power by ISPs who seek to offer tiered pricing, regulate political content they might disagree with, or single-out certain users or applications and deny them access.\n\nThe extent of the FCC's authority over ISPs, however, is an open question currently subject to varied legal wrangling on all sides of the issue. Thus, net neutrality is in an ever-precarious state of being. Which brings us to today.\n\nPresident Trump's appointed FCC Chairman, Ajit Pai, began the process of compromising net neutrality just a few months after taking office.\n\nIn a 2-1 vote along partisan lines–the FCC is nonsensically straitjacketed by a rule that no more than three of its five members may come from the same political party–earlier this year, the FCC decided to review the Obama-era policy on net neutrality.\n\n[image via ; video courtesy The Hill]\n\nFollow Colin Kalmbacher on Twitter: @colinkalmbacher"}

He has said he revealed the information because he feared that the programs were violating the rights of private citizens. He has been charged with leaking classified documents.\n\nThe portion of the interview that aired on the \"Today\" show Friday morning did not explain how the elder Snowden had developed his opinion as to the conditions under which his 30-year-old son might return home.\n\nLonnie Snowden sent a letter to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. with his suggestions about how to get his son to return to this country, Isikoff reported. In the interview, he said he knew his son had broken the law but does not think he committed treason.\n\nView Graphic The flight of Edward Snowden\n\n\"He has betrayed his government, but I don't believe that he's betrayed the people of the United States,\" Lonnie Snowden said.\n\n\"I love him.

It's simply to release as much information as possible.\"\n\nEdward Snowden is reportedly seeking asylum from Ecuador. He surfaced in Hong Kong shortly after his leaked information was published, then vanished until he arrived in Moscow last Sunday.\n\nHe is believed to have been planning to travel from there to Ecuador, possibly via Cuba. But as a crush of journalists descended on the airport Monday, he did not board the designated Havana-bound flight. He has remained out of public view, as heads of government have verbally jousted over whether he should be extradited to the United States."}

{"text": "Columbus Blue Jackets defenseman Jack Johnson's parents have left their son with a mountain of debt, but this apparently wasn't the first time Jack Sr. and Tina Johnson took advantage of a family member. According to two sources with knowledge of the transaction, Johnson's parents secretly seized ownership of his grandfather's Las Vegas condominium to use as collateral for a loan.\n\n(To make this easy to follow, as there are multiple Jack Johnsons involved, we're going to number them. Jack Three is the NHL player; Jack Two is his father, who is accused of scamming both; Jack One [who died in October 2008] is the grandfather.)\n\nClark County (Nev.) records show Jack One's deed to the condo dated May 5, 2002, when he retired to Vegas. On Oct. 20, 2004, Jack Two requested a change in deed over into his name, listing his Ann Arbor, Mich. address. Two sources tell us that Jack Two transferred the deed without Jack One's knowledge. The signature for Jack One on the original deed (left) and on the deed transfer (right) are significantly different.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same day Jack One handed over ownership of the condo, Tina filed a quitclaim deed, transferring her share over to Jack Two, who then took out a mortgage. One source says the loan was for approximately $140,000, while the other source, who didn't dispute any other details of the transfer, says it was for $165,000.\n\nBoth sources say that Jack One didn't realize he didn't own his condo until nearly a month later. On Nov. 10, 2004, he attempted to sell the condo to a new couple, and \"it became apparent that there was this lien on [Jack One's] property,\" said one source, who believes Jack One paid off the loan \"because he didn't want his son to go to jail.\"\n\nOur sources claim that Jack Two was able to defraud his father (and son) without much effort because they all have the same full name—John Joseph-Louis Johnson—and because Tina had a real estate license and knew her way around the documents. (On June 5, 2007, the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Growth immediately revoked Tina's license for an unspecified rule violation and fined her $10,000.) When Jack One discovered he was being defrauded, one source says, he would settle the debt before the authorities got involved.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJack One was reportedly furious when, under pressure from his parents, Jack Three fired agent Pat Brisson and signed over control of his finances. According to a source, he knew they would handle his grandson's money the same way they handled his. \"Jack knew the history he had with them, that he couldn't have them be in control of the money, and that's exactly what happened,\" the source said.\n\nMultiple phone calls to Tina Johnson requesting comment from her and Jack Two were not returned. An email to Tina bounced back as undeliverable, indicating that she deleted the account since we contacted her for our previous report. A spokesperson for the Blue Jackets said Jack Johnson is not speaking about his financial situation.\n\nBelow are the documents for the Las Vegas condo.

{"text": "DHARAMSALA, India (Reuters) - The Dalai Lama has encouraged Tibetans in exile to embrace the democratic system of electing a leader, saying it was essential to keep step with the larger world and to ensure the continuity of their government.\n\nExiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama listens after his arrival at Roissy Charles de Gaulle airport near Paris on June 6, 2009. REUTERS/Jacky Naegelen\n\nIn a video clip shown to hundreds of monks, nuns and lay people in the northern Indian hill town of Dharamsala late on Saturday, the 73-year-old also said it was no longer essential to thrust spiritual and political leadership on one person.\n\n\"The Dalai Lamas held temporal and spiritual leadership over the last 400-500 years. It may have been quite useful. But that period is over,\" the Nobel Prize winner said in the clip, according to a translated transcript.\n\n\"Today, it is clear to the whole world that democracy is the best system despite its minor negativities. That is why it is important that Tibetans also move with the larger world community,\" he said.\n\nThe Dalai Lama has suggested before it is up to Tibetans whether they continue with the spiritual institution after he dies, and could order an election among Tibetans abroad.\n\nThe Dalai Lama could also choose a successor himself from members of his government-in-exile, or a college of senior lamas could pick someone from within its ranks, removing the mysticism of the traditional selection process.\n\n\"When we put the whole responsibility in the person of the Dalai Lama, it is dangerous ... it is appropriate that a democratically elected leader lead a people's movement,\" he said.\n\n\"In reality, a change is happening in the responsibility of the Dalai Lama as the temporal and spiritual leader. This, I think, is very good ... a religious leader having to assume political leadership, that period is over,\" he said.\n\nSENSITIVE ISSUE\n\nThe Dalai Lama's succession is a sensitive issue as he ages and his health declines.\n\nMany Tibetans fear that the death of the Dalai Lama, who has lived in exile in India since fleeing a failed uprising against Chinese rule in 1959, could create a leadership vacuum that Beijing could exploit to tighten its grip.\n\nChina has said the Dalai Lama must follow \"historical conventions,\" including an endorsement from Beijing.\n\nAccording to Beijing, the Dalai Lama's incarnation must be chosen by drawing lots from a gold urn given to Tibetans by the ethnic Manchu emperors of the Qing dynasty.\n\nBut the Dalai Lama has suggested his incarnation might be found outside China, or even that Tibetans themselves could order a vote on whether to continue an institution that once gave one monk both spiritual and temporal sway over Tibet.\n\nHe has also called for more democratic systems: Tibetans in exile first elected a prime minister, or Kalon Tripa, in 2001, which the Dalai Lama called a \"magnificent achievement.\"\n\nThe current prime minister, Samdhong Rinpoche, a Tibetan monk and a Buddhist scholar, has served two terms, and the Dalai Lama has often said he was in \"semi-retirement\" as a political leader, asking Rinpoche to take the lead in interacting with Tibetans.\n\n\"As election takes place every five years, irrespective of whether the Dalai Lama is there or not, the exiled political system will remain secure, stable and sustainable in the long term,\" he said in the clip broadcast on Saturday."}

Bonham's sold the mold Wednesday, March 1 during an auction in London. The germs are preserved in a glass case and feature an inscription by Fleming on the back, identifying it as \"the mould that first made penicillin.\" (AP Photo/Alastair Grant)\n\nLONDON (AP) — How much is an old, dried out piece of mold worth? Apparently more than $14,600 if it was created by the doctor who discovered penicillin.\n\nThe nearly 90-year-old swatch of mold has a rather extraordinary history: It came from the laboratory of Dr. Alexander Fleming whose revolutionary discovery brought the world its first antibiotic, credited with saving millions of lives worldwide.\n\nThe patchy bit of mold from his niece's collection was auctioned in London on Wednesday for 11,875 pounds ($14,617). The buyer was not identified.\n\nThe mold is preserved in a round glass case and features an inscription by Fleming on the back, describing it as \"the mould that first made penicillin.\"\n\nThat, however, may be a stretch. The Scottish-born doctor likely made at least dozens of such mold mementos, derived from his original sample of the fungus.\n\nFleming \"sent these samples out to dignitaries and to people in the scientific world, almost as a kind of holy relic,\" said Matthew Haley, director of books and manuscripts at the auction house Bonham's.\n\nHe noted that other bits of mold were given to Pope Pius XII, Winston Churchill and Marlene Dietrich, perhaps in an effort to cement Fleming's legacy as the discoverer of penicillin in 1928.\n\nBefore the discovery, infections like pneumonia and rheumatic fever were near death-sentences.\n\n\"When it first became available, penicillin was called a miracle drug,\" said Kevin Brown, archivist at the Alexander Fleming Laboratory Museum . \"Its discovery began a new, life-saving era in medicine.\"\n\nIn some ways, the discovery was accidental. Fleming found mold growing in an experiment when he returned to his cramped lab after a stay at his country house. One petri dish was full of bacteria except for an area where mold was growing. He later realized the mold — a rare strain of penicillin — was killing off the bacteria around it.\n\n\"Fleming noticed something that other people would have missed and saw the potential of penicillin to treat patients,\" said Brown.\n\nScientists at Oxford University further developed penicillin, and production was ramped up so that enough of the antibiotic would be available for the Allied invasion on D-Day in 1944. Fleming and Oxford scientists Ernst Boris Chain and Howard Walter Florey were awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine in 1945.\n\nBrown noted that not everybody was thrilled to receive the preserved mold medallions and that some got multiple copies, including Queen Elizabeth's husband, Prince Philip.\n\n\"Every time he met Fleming, he got another one of these things,\" Brown said."}
{"text": "An independent auditor has found the Metro LRT Line is still not safe to run at full speed between NAIT and Churchill stations, and likely won't be for at least three more months.\n\nCity council had hoped to get a definitive answer Tuesday about the reliability of the line's signalling system.\n\nRail Safety Consulting reviewed the contractor's safety case for the signalling system and found the line can start to pick up speed, but not at road intersections.\n\nRiders could start to see minor improvements to the speed of the trains in two weeks.\n\nBut with five intersections along the 3.3-km line, the trains will not run at 50 km/h, as they were expected to.\n\n\"I don't think the train is going to move that much faster,\" said Mayor Don Iveson. \"That might shave a minute off the trip. It's not significant.\"\n\nCity administration said they don't know how much travel times would improve by intermittently increasing the speed of the trains.\n\n\"It's a bit of a feeling-out process,\" said Adam Laughlin, general manager of integrated infrastructure services.\n\nLittle confidence in new timelines\n\nDelays on the signalling system and problems with the safety documents have dogged the line since April 2014, when it was initially supposed to open.\n\nSince September 2015, trains have operated on the line at reduced frequency, and at a maximum speed of 25 km/h, giving operators time to stop if they see something on the tracks.\n\nLaughlin said there are still serious safety issues with turning the line up to full speed. For example, there are still examples of the traffic arms not lowering, even as trains approach intersections.\n\nHe said the city now hopesto have the line moving at full speed between NAIT and MacEwan stations by August 2016.\n\nThe city plans to run trains every two and a half minutes by the beginning of 2017.\n\nAt this point though, the new timelines are only projections.\n\n\"I think the history of this project has shown we struggle meeting that, predominantly because of the performance of Thales,\" Laughlin said.\n\nFrustrated councillors questioned whether the problems with the line would ever be fixed.\n\n​\"At some point, this is going to be up and running 100 per cent?\" asked Coun. Michael Oshry.\n\nAfter a long pause, Laughlin answered, \"Yes.\"\n\nNo ribbon cutting for long delayed project\n\nThe city has recently seen more signs of co-operation from Thales, he said.\n\nIveson said the city is trying to be transparent with the public about progress on the project, but said the problem is mostly outside of its control.\n\n\"We're working hard to hold the contractor accountable, but we can't make the software work ourselves,\" he said.\n\nIveson has yet to take his first ride on the line. He said he wouldn't take the train until it was fully up and running. At this point, that will be nearly three years from the original opening date.\n\nNow, he said he may settle for riding the line when it runs full speed, even if the trains aren't running at full frequency.\n\nCoun. Mike Nickel asked when the city can officially cut the ribbon on the Metro Line.\n\n\"Quite frankly, I would not have a ribbon cutting, given the history of this project,\" city manager Linda Cochrane replied.\n\nIveson said a collective sigh of relief when the line finally works will be celebration enough."}
{"text": "From 1st October 2017 the A, B, C & D insurance write-off categories are being replaced to make the system easier to understand.\n\nAs long as you know what you are doing, buying an insurance write-off can be a very economical way to acquire a motorbike.\n\nBikes have become ever-more sophisticated – ABS and traction control are no longer the preserve of superbikes – meaning repairs through official repairers can often be uneconomical.\n\nInsurer's authorised repairers tend to specify complete nuts and bolts repairs, featuring all-new OEM parts, which can lead to an unnecessarily expensive invoice for the insurer.\n\nHowever, much of the damaged caused during an accident or theft attempt can be repaired more economically by smaller garages and home mechanics.\n\nInsurers are increasingly likely to write off a vehicle once the value of repairs exceeded half of the value of the bike, meaning there has been a steady stream of 'cheap' bikes available to easily repair.\n\nThe Association of British Insurers (ABI) has now changed the voluntary code around write-offs because too many perfectly reparable vehicles were scrapped, and equally, too many unsafe vehicles were making their way back onto the market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\nClearer classifications\n\nUnder the old system, the emphasis was on the cost of repairs. Now, insurers can make the type of write off much clearer.\n\nThe old system of A, B, C & D categories are now replaced by the following new classifications:\n\nA – Scrap only\n\nB – Break for parts\n\nS – Structurally damaged but repairable\n\nN – Not structurally damaged, repairable\n\nA Category insurance write-offs\n\nA – Scrap only. This is a write-off in all senses of the term. An 'A' classification means the vehicle is too dangerous to be put back on the road and must be destroyed, by crushing.\n\nB Category insurance write-offs\n\nB – Break for parts. The 'B' classification applies to vehicles that again are too dangerous to be put back on the road, but salvageable parts can be removed (and sold) before the vehicle is destroyed.\n\nS Category insurance write-offs\n\nS – Structurally damaged but repairable. This new category indicates the vehicle has suffered significant enough damaged that it is no longer economically repairable by the insurance company's own repairer.\n\nN Category insurance write-offs\n\nN – Not structurally damaged, repairable. The other new category is fairly self-explanatory. Typical causes for this kind of 'write-off' would be cosmetic damage to sports bike panels or damage to steering locks and discs brakes during theft attempts. Like Category S, these vehicles are perfectly fine if repaired properly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\nThe new classifications have been developed after a two-year consultation with Thatcham Research technical experts.\n\nAs the classifications are applied by insurers, and the code is voluntary, there is no guarantee the bike you may be buying has not been involved in an accident.\n\nIt's not unknown for owners to not declare an accident to an insurer and to put the motorbike back on the road. To avoid buying a 'bodged' bike, always get an inspection by a qualified mechanic if you don't have the technical and mechanical knowledge yourself.\n\nGet yourself sorted:\n\nIt's possible to get a bargain when you delve into the world of insurance write-offs. But be prepared.\n\nAdvertisement"}

He also had suffered major head trauma and internal injuries.\n\nStephanie Fibelkorn, 21, the Ohio State engineering student who died in the Dec. 12 crash, was an intern for Lewis. She was working her last day at the city engineer�s office on the day she was killed. The two were walking to a meeting when they were struck.\n\n�Obviously, we are all very saddened,� said Dan Williamson, speaking on behalf of Columbus Mayor Michael B. Coleman last night.\n\n�Everyone at the city has been praying for Bill. This entire incident has been heartbreaking for the city and the Department of Public Service,� he said. �We lost Stephanie and now we have lost Bill. Our prayers are with his family. He was an outstanding employee and a good friend.�\n\nLewis was one of the city�s �finest engineers,� said Rick Tilton, assistant director of the Department of Public Service.\n\n�He was just a master of his craft. It�s not going to be the same with him not there.�\n\nThe way that people have rallied around the families of Lewis and Fibelkorn is �a good measure of what people thought of both of them,� Tilton said.\n\nSurgeons at Grant Medical Center initially said that Lewis was �defying the odds� because he seemed to be rallying despite the extent of his injuries, Jennifer Hansen, a family friend, said in a prior interview.\n\nThe investigation into the crash continues and no one has yet been charged.\n\nThe Columbus police accident-investigation unit continues to interview dozens of witnesses who were at or near High and Broad streets the morning of Dec. 12, said Sgt. Brooke Wilson.\n\nThe crash happened about 10 a.m., when police say a pickup truck driven by Terrance Trent, speeding and weaving in traffic on E. Broad Street, went out of control and hit a school bus at the intersection of Broad and High.\n\nThe Groveport Madison bus, carrying a few special-needs students, was pushed onto the sidewalk where Lewis and Fibelkorn stood waiting to cross at the light. Both were crushed by the bus.\n\nTrent, 61, and a passenger in his truck, Mamie Adams, 51, were injured, as was the bus driver, Brenda Detty. The students on the bus weren�t hurt.\n\nTrent, in an interview with The Dispatch, said that Adams was hitting him with a can of pop while he was driving and he was trying to get to the police station.

{"text": "Canada needs to scrap the capital gains tax and slash corporate taxes as a way to enhance economic growth, Conservative leadership hopeful Maxime Bernier said Tuesday.\n\nIn a speech to a business audience, the Quebec MP outlined what he called an ambitious plan to unleash Canada's productive forces even as he thumped familiar Conservative tropes.\n\n\"Prosperity does not come from government spending but rather from entrepreneurs' investing,\" Bernier told receptive members of the Canadian Club.\n\n\"More spending on the scale offered by the Liberal government is not going to stimulate the economy and bring us prosperity, it will act as a sedative for the economy.\"\n\nBernier said his proposal to axe the tax might sound radical, but he pointed out the levy did not exist before the Liberal government of Pierre Trudeau introduced the measure in 1972. Abolishing it, he said, would encourage people to save and invest more and lower the cost of capital for start-ups.\n\nGenerally speaking, when an asset or property is sold, 50 per cent of any profit is subject to tax. As a result, investors are discouraged from selling assets and investing in productive new ones because of a reluctance to trigger the gains tax, Bernier said.\n\nWhile such a measure would cost the treasury about $3 billion a year in foregone revenue, Bernier said the economic benefits would \"vastly exceed\" the losses.\n\n\"The capital gains tax is a tax on investment,\" said the bilingual Bernier, who spoke only in English. \"The more you tax something, the less of it you will get.\"\n\nThe former cabinet minister under ex-prime minister Stephen Harper also said he would slash corporate income taxes by one-third as a way to encourage business investments.\n\nThe Harper government cut the rate to 15 per cent from 22 per cent but that wasn't enough, he said, even though the country's combined federal and provincial rate is in the middle when compared with other developed countries.\n\n\"I propose to bring down the federal rate to 10 per cent,\" Bernier said.\n\nSome economists are predicting anemic growth of 1.3 per cent this year, a barrier to improvements in Canada's standard of living, he said.\n\nBernier has previously announced other proposals, including one to scrap supply management — long considered a Conservative sacred cow. It's time, he said, to stop taking billions of dollars out of the private sector only to distribute the money through subsidies he said amount to corporate welfare.\n\nIn an interview after his speech, Bernier fudged when it came to social questions such as abortion — an issue of special interest to social conservatives — although he recently denounced an idea from rival candidate Kelly Leitch to screen would-be immigrants for \"Canadian values.\"\n\nAny MP is free to table a bill on abortion and, if it was up to him, he would allow a free vote in the Commons, Bernier told The Canadian Press. However, he refused to say where he stands on limiting a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy.\n\n\"Personally, I will see,\" he said. \"I don't want to personally have a position on that.\"\n\nInstead, he said, he wanted to focus the debate on economic concerns with his tax ideas.\n\nBernier warned what might happen if interest rates were to rise in light of record high debt levels carried by Canadians. Artificially low rates have created a bubble in various sectors of the kind that led to the crash in 2007, he said.\n\nNational Observer exists thanks to reader subscriptions and donations.

{"text": "Your mother can't produce food out of thin air, no one can. Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfigura—... It's impossible to make good food out of nothing! You can Summon it if you know where it is, you can transform it, you can increase the quantity if you've already got some...\" —The exceptions to Gamp's Law[src]\n\nGamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration is a law governing the magical world. There are five Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law, one of which is food.\n\nThe formulation of Gamp's Law has not been stated, but food being one of its Principal Exceptions means that it cannot be created from nothing. Therefore, it can be reasonably inferred that Gamp's Law relates in some way to magic that creates something from nothing. It can also be inferred that the other four exceptions are other categories of substance which cannot be created from nothing.\n\nIt should be noted that while food cannot be outright created from nothing, it can be multiplied if one already has some food to multiply, it can be enlarged or the food can be summoned if one knows the approximate location and is fairly sure the food will still be there.[1] It should also be noted that while food cannot be conjured, consumable liquids such as sauces[2] and potable water can be.[3]\n\nContents show]\n\nHistory\n\nMcGonagall summoned food from elsewhere, as when conjured a never ending platter of sandwiches to Snape's office from the Hogwarts kitchens[4]; increased, as Hagrid did by using the Engorgement Charm on pumpkins[5]; or transformed as Molly Weasley did when cooking. As one of the Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration, food cannot be \"made from thin air\", but can be multiplied if one already has some food to multiply, it can be enlarged or the food can be summoned if one knows the approximate location.\n\nIn September 1997, after Ron commented that his mother could make good food out of thin air, Hermione stated that this was impossible, as food is one of the five Principal Exemptions to this law, but this only irritated Ron, who wanted her to \"speak English\", but was not satisfied by her explanation.[6]\n\nOn 1 May, 1998, after Neville Longbottom noted that the one thing that the Room of Requirement did not seem to be able to provide was food, Ron commented that food was one of the five Principal Exceptions to this law, to \"general astonishment\".[7]\n\nBehind the scenes\n\nGamp's Law apparently uses the surname of the person who discovered it. Hesper Gamp, a witch married to Sirius Black II, might be that person or a relative of that person. [8]\n\nAccording to W.O.M.B.A.T., it may or may not be possible to turn an animal into a human.\n\nAlthough many things appear impossible to conjure, there is legislation in the wizarding world about what can and cannot be conjured. [9]\n\nThe series appears to break one of these laws early on. In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, McGonagall appears to conjure a platter of sandwiches and a jug of Pumpkin juice out of thin air when Harry and Ron arrive late; however, she may have simply apparated the food from the kitchen similar to the way the house-elves make the food magically appear for feasts.\n\nAppearances"}

There were no injuries, but some damage was caused to nearby homes.\n\nIn addition to the direct strike on the Ashkelon house, another Katyusha and a Qassam hit southern Israel on Sunday afternoon. The Katyusha struck in a western Negev community, causing some damage to a local structure. It is unclear where the third rocket landed.\n\nTwo of the rockets fired earlier in the day hit the western Negev town of Sderot, damaging homes and leaving several people suffering from shock.\n\nA rocket also scored a direct hit on a house in a western Negev kibbutz, damaging the building. The family was not home at the time.\n\nA Katyusha struck the tomb of the late Rabbi Baba Sali in Netivot earlier in the day, causing no injuries or damage.\n\nOver the weekend dozens of Qassam rockets and Katyushas were fired at Ashkelon, Sderot and communities bordering the Gaza Strip. Seven Israeli civilians were lightly wounded.\n\nAshkelon resident vows: 'We will not turn into Sderot'\n\nAshkelon's mayor said on Sunday he would not accept the rockets becoming a normal reality.\n\n\"This is a state of war, I know no other definition for it,\" said Roni Mahatzri, from his makeshift office in an underground bunker. \"If it lasts a week or two, we can handle that, but we have no intention of allowing this to become part of our daily routine.\"\n\nThat seemed to be the major concern for most residents.\n\n\"We will not turn into Sderot,\" Shimoni said, referring to the town that has suffered most of the rocket attacks over the past seven years. The rockets have killed 13 people, wounded dozens more, caused millions of dollars in damage and made daily life unbearable.\n\nAshkelon residents took to the street on Saturday night urging government action against the Gaza militants.\n\nOn Sunday, the city was relatively calm, with foreign dignitaries visiting to convey support, and maintenance crews diligently collecting debris and paving over craters left by rockets hitting parking lots.\n\nThe mayor said attendance in schools was nearly perfect, and, though it was the talk of the town, residents didn't seem too panicked by the weekend developments."}

{"text": "At a Tampa film festival in 2014, a conservationist for Google said something that struck young Florida documentary filmmaker and digital designer Derek Alan Rowe. During a presentation on Google Earth's underwater street view feature, he said something along the lines of, \"If I can get someone's head underwater, I can get them under the ocean.\"\n\nIn other words, the way to get people engaged in the world around them is to first get them interacting with it.\n\nAfter some reflection on that idea, Rowe decided to use his background in technology and film to \"set a new bar for conservation media.\" He made the move from Orlando to Durham, identifying with the city's growing tech scene. And now he's on his way toward setting that bar with WildEyes , a project aimed to bring all of the U.S. National Parks to life in virtual reality.\n\nThe project launched last fall after Rowe raised $9,001 through an Indiegogo campaign. The funds went toward park and travel expenses and 360-degree camera equipment.\n\nAlso helping jumpstart the project is Doctrine Creative , a small creative production company in Orlando that Rowe runs with three co-founders.\n\nTo Rowe, the demo showed that WildEyes works in classrooms and should be in the hands of students everywhere.\n\nA new partnership should make this goal possible.\n\nWildEyes just became a content provider for Google Expeditions , a free application teachers can use to take their students on virtual reality field trips anywhere in the world—from the ocean depths to outer space.\n\nGoogle Expeditions will release WildEyes content to the app on the National Park Service's 100-year anniversary, August 25.\n\nIn light of WildEyes' success, Rowe has not lost sight of his mission to create content that stays true to the park experience, that \"breaks down what's inspiring about the natural world,\" he says.\n\nNate Hoffmeier, assistant organizer of Research Triangle Park's virtual reality network, WildEyes is among a new crop of virtual reality startups that are reimagining existing technology to better industries such as education, medicine, therapy and even architecture, says, assistant organizer of Research Triangle Park's virtual reality network, RTPVR\n\nwas formed earlier this year by Vive , which is part of major smartphone brand HTC. It consists of top technology venture capital firms such as Sequoia Capital and Redpoint Ventures . With a $10 billion bankroll, the alliance meets every month in Beijing and San Francisco to hear pitches from virtual reality startups. And they're attracting the attention of venture capitalists. The Virtual Reality Venture Capital Alliance\n\nBut since the industry is so fresh, there's little competition between startups in the virtual reality space. This allows for room to collaborate on ways to build sustainable business models, with or without venture capital support, Hoffmeier says.\n\nThough it's part of an industry that hasn't yet seen massive success or massive failure, WildEyes has an edge, Hoffmeier believes.\n\nIt uses virtual reality to \"share these beautiful experiences with kids who might not have exposure to these places,\" and serves as an educator in the industry.\n\n\"WildEyes is hoping to increase awareness of our natural parks and introduce people to the concept of going outside and enjoying nature,\" he adds.\n\nExisting within a budding tech industry that's full of never-before-seen innovation, WildEyes stays in touch with something intangible and everlasting.\n\nIt's harnessing new technologies as mediums to connect people of all ages to the universally primitive act of appreciating nature."}
{"text": "As a Flushing development project continues to stall, a City Council candidate is calling for a new vision.\n\nQueens Assemblyman Francisco Moya, who is running for the 21st Council District seat being vacated by outgoing Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras-Copeland, has announced \"a community-minded high bar\" vision for the Willets Point development site.\n\nThe politician's proposal comes in the wake of the New York State Court of Appeals ruling that the Queens Development Group's (QDG) plan will not be able to move forward without approval from state legislature due to its situation on parkland. At a post-decision Community Board 7 (CB 7) meeting, a representative for QDG said the group was \"huddling up internally\" to determine the next course of action.\n\nMost recently, New York City Economic Development Corporation (EDC) President James Patchett told CB 7 the city is \"not shying away from the plan\" to develop the site despite the board's allegations the agency was not being cooperative.\n\n\"Our city cannot wait longer,\" Moya said in a prepared statement. \"Queens deserves a world-class project that looks toward the future and rejects the failures of the past. Any future negotiations for this blighted community must meet stringent thresholds that benefit working families and seniors here in East Elmhurst and Corona.\"\n\nUnder Moya's vision, 100 percent of constructed housing at the site would be affordable, with 33 percent reserved for those who have an income of $25,000 or less. Additionally, a retail \"World's Borough Market\" would be built, similarly modeled to the Essex Street Market in the Lower East Side, with all local vendors and businesses. Moya also proposes \"extensive\" environmental remediation at the site and a dedicated funding stream to Flushing Meadows-Corona Park improvements as part of his plan.\n\nThe assemblyman has pledged to work with the state legislature to secure the required parkland alienation provisions should his proposal move forward, according to the press release. He did not include details as to how his project would be funded.\n\nMoya also proposes the \"immediate creation\" of a community advisory council, giving the community a venue to voice their thoughts and concerns with the project.\n\n\"We must be bold,\" Moya continued. \"I want to see more jobs in our neighborhoods, a requirement to help minority- and women-owned businesses from start to execution, a major economic engine, and the largest affordable housing complex on the development books in our city.\"\n\nThe lawmaker also takes a shot at fellow candidate Hiram Monserrate, whose \"inaction\" as the former city representative contributed to the project's \"stagnation,\" he alleges.\n\nMonserrate told QNS the deal he made in 2008 regarding the Willets Point project was renegotiated by the current Councilmember, Ferreras-Copeland, and stated Moya was \"ripping a page from the Trump playbook in creating alternative facts.\"\n\n\"But now that Moya is running for a new seat, he wants our community to believe he is supportive of bringing affordable housing to a community he has ignored for almost a decade,\" Monserrate said. \"He is the candidate of the greedy billionaire developers and a puppet of political insiders that seek to gentrify our neighborhood and price us out all out.\"\n\n\"We are committed to providing affordable housing and amenities that meet the needs of this community,\" an EDC spokesperson said. \"We look forward to continuing this discussion to determine the next steps for this important project.\""}
{"text": "Pope Francis on 10 Reasons Why People Reject the Church\n\nThe Church's most prominent outreach today, the New Evangelization, aims at reviving the spiritual lives of those who have drifted from Christ. While these people may have been baptized and perhaps catechized, while they may attend Church semi-regularly, they have never been truly evangelized. They have never experienced a life-changing encounter with Jesus Christ or real transformation through his Church.\n\nA couple weeks ago, Pope Francis delivered a powerful message to the Brazilian bishops in the midst of his World Youth Day celebrations. Unfortunately, it didn't get nearly the attention it deserved.\n\nSpeaking on the New Evangelization, and using the Emmaus Journey as a framework, the Pope encouraged his listeners to reflect on why people reject the Church today—why, like the Emmaus disciples, they decide to walk the other way. To bring people back to Christ and his Church, we must understand why they leave in the first place.\n\nTo that end, Pope Francis offered ten specific reasons:\n\n1. The Church no longer offers anything meaningful or important.\n\n2. The Church appears too weak.\n\n3. The Church appears too distant from their needs.\n\n4. The Church appears too poor to respond to their concerns.\n\n5. The Church appears too cold.\n\n6. The Church appears too caught up with itself.\n\n7. The Church appears to be a prisoner of its own rigid formulas.\n\n8. The world seems to have made the Church a relic of the past.\n\n9. The Church appears unfit to answer the world's new questions.\n\n10. The Church speaks to people in their infancy but not when they come of age.\n\n\nRead the excerpt below for more context:\n\n\"The two disciples have left Jerusalem. They are leaving behind the 'nakedness' of God. They are scandalized by the failure of the Messiah in whom they had hoped and who now appeared utterly vanquished, humiliated, even after the third day.\n\n\nHere we have to face the difficult mystery of those people who leave the Church, who, under the illusion of alternative ideas, now think that the Church—their Jerusalem—can no longer offer them anything meaningful and important. So they set off on the road alone, with their disappointment. Perhaps the Church appeared too weak, perhaps too distant from their needs, perhaps too poor to respond to their concerns, perhaps too cold, perhaps too caught up with itself, perhaps a prisoner of its own rigid formulas, perhaps the world seems to have made the Church a relic of the past, unfit for new questions; perhaps the Church could speak to people in their infancy but not to those come of age.\n\n\nIt is a fact that nowadays there are many people like the two disciples of Emmaus; not only those looking for answers in the new religious groups that are sprouting up, but also those who already seem godless, both in theory and in practice.\n\n\nFaced with this situation, what are we to do?\n\n\nWe need a Church unafraid of going forth into their night. We need a Church capable of meeting them on their way. We need a Church capable of entering into their conversation. We need a Church able to dialogue with those disciples who, having left Jerusalem behind, are wandering aimlessly, alone, with their own disappointment, disillusioned by a Christianity now considered barren, fruitless soil, incapable of generating meaning.\"\n\nWhich of these reasons do you see as most significant?\n\n\n(HT: Thomas Doran at Catholic World Report)"}
{"text": "If you're usual dating routines aren't working for you, then it might be time to rip a page from some of your favorite Super Bowl commercials of all time. With all the hype surrounding this year's Super Bowl, starting with Bud Light's teaser Super Bowl ad featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger warming up for an epic game of ping-pong, It's Just Lunch came up with five relationship lessons singles can learn from watching the Super Bowl, if only for the commercials.\n\nThe more you invest, the more you will get out of your relationship.\n\nWith Super Bowl advertisers spending $4 million and upward for a 30 second commercial, many of them are expecting a higher return on their investment for every dollar spent in the form of increased purchase intent. Much like joining a recreational sports team, you're only going to get out of it as much as you put into it. If you don't show up or make any efforts to improve your (dating) game, then you're not going to have the same experiences as someone who does show up and make an effort. Take charge of your own love life by putting in the time and energy required to make a relationship last for the long haul.\n\nWe all just want to connect with someone on a deeper level.\n\nEmotional appeal is the number one leading element found in virtually every Super Bowl commercial you've ever watched. This year, Super Bowl advertisers are leaning heavily to creating a sense of nostalgia that will resonate with the masses by transporting them to a different era through pre-turn-of-the-century music, flashback images from the past and celebrities from the past, like Arnold Schwarzennegar who we haven't seen with shoulder-length hair since his \"Conan the Barbarian\" days back in the 80s.\n\nHumor can go a long way, especially when tensions are rising.\n\nFalling right behind emotional appeal, humor is considered the second leading element you're likely to find in some of the most memorable Super Bowl commercials. Remember watching Betty White get tackled for a Snickers commercial or when Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd thought they were the next big thing for Samsung? Humor is a great way to diffuse tensions, both on the field and off the field where its likely to count most in your current or prospective relationships.\n\nWe all have a secret desire to escape from reality and revisit our youth.\n\nWhen people watch the Super Bowl, they get super absorbed into it and become very present in the game itself. In fact, some people even treat Super Bowl Sunday almost like a religious holiday, and use it as a day to get away from it all and get lost a someone else's reality for a change. This kind of plays out in relationships as well. If relationships truly make the world go round, then the best kinds of relationships are the ones that makes you feel like you and your partner are in your own world together.\n\nExpose yourself to a new world when you step out of your comfort zone.\n\nUSA Today reports singing and dancing football stars in a Super Bowl commercial for Pepsi to include the likes of Terry Bradshaw and and Deion Sanders. We're not quite sure what to expect, but we wouldn't be surprised to see America's favorite iconic NFL players in tutus considering all the hype of putting them in a new light for the Pepsi spot. If Pepsi's goal is to reach new audiences, such as musical lovers and Glee fans, then it might be worth noting for singles. If you're tired of your current dating pool, try stepping out of your comfort zone to expose yourself to a new world of people waiting to meet you."}
{"text": "Researchers from Italy and Portugal announced Tuesday the discovery of a new dinosaur species that lived 150 million years ago in what is Wyoming today. Named Galeamopus pabsti, the Jurassic era dinosaur's fossil was excavated in 1995 by a Swiss team.\n\nPaleontologists from the University of Turin in Italy, and Universidade Nova de Lisboa along with Museu da Lourinhã in Portugal, described the new sauropod species in a paper titled \"Osteology of Galeamopus pabsti sp. nov. (Sauropoda: Diplodocidae), with implications for neurocentral closure timing, and the cervico-dorsal transition in diplodocids,\" that appeared Tuesday in the journal PeerJ.\n\nPhoto: Octávio Mateus\n\nG. pabsti was similar to the more famous dinosaur genus Diplodocus, whose members grew over 80 feet in size. In comparison, G. pabsti had \"more massive legs, and a particularly high and triangular neck close to the head,\" according to a statement Tuesday by the authors of the paper.\n\nThe species was named in honor of Ben Pabst, who along with Hans-Jakob \"Kirby\" Siber, led the Swiss team of excavators who first found the fossil. Sauropods had greatly elongated necks and tails, and large bodies. They were found in South America, Europe and Africa, but most diversity is known from North America, specifically the U.S.\n\nPhoto: Davide Bonadonna\n\nIn another study, also announced Tuesday, researchers from the Imperial College London along with colleagues in France and elsewhere in Europe said they identified an overlooked fossil in a museum to be the earliest known member of a giant dinosaur family called titanosauriforms, which were a subgroup of sauropods.\n\nDiscovered in France in the 1930s, the fossil had been largely ignored up till now. Researchers have named the species Vouivria damparisensis, and suggested in a statement it lived about 160 million years ago. Species that made up the titanosauriform family were among the largest land creatures to have lived, and the most famous member of the family was the brachiosaurus.\n\nThe individual specimen of V. damparisensis whose fossil the researchers examined was over 15 meters long and weighed about 15,000 kilograms. With a long neck held diagonally upward, a long tail and four legs of equal length, it was likely a herbivore.\n\nPhoto: Imperial College London/ Chase Stone\n\nPhilip Mannion, lead author of the study from Imperial College London, said in a statement Tuesday: \"Vouivria would have been a herbivore, eating all kinds of vegetation, such as ferns and conifers. This creature lived in the Late Jurassic, around 160 million years ago, at a time when Europe was a series of islands. We don't know what this creature died from, but millions of years later it is providing important evidence to help us understand in more detail the evolution of brachiosaurid sauropods and a much bigger group of dinosaurs that they belonged to, called titanosauriforms.\"\n\nThe name of the species pays homage to Damparis, the village where the fossil was found. The first word of its name derives from an old French word whose Latin root means \"viper.\" In the region of Damparis, \"la vouivre\" is a mythical winged reptile."}

It has now been a month since Cruz ran. A Week 4 (at best) return is becoming more inevitable by the day, even if coach Tom Coughlin said the calf problem was still just a strain.\n\nLB Jon Beason (knee) - He didn't think he could play last week at the level he wanted.

Beason did stretch and do some work on a side field with trainers.\n\nLT Ereck Flowers (ankle) - He played three quarters on Sunday night with an ankle injury and underwent an MRI on Monday. The results were encouraging enough that Flowers was back on the practice facility Wednesday, at least in a limited (maybe even full) capacity.\n\nTE Daniel Fells (foot) - He missed practice on Wednesday.

{"text": "by Brett Stevens on January 7, 2015\n\nThe media pundits and protesters in Paris want a target, so they will blame \"extremism\" which is a code word for \"Muslim extremism,\" ignoring the underlying issue which is that diversity does not work, has never worked throughout history, and cannot work because it creates paradoxical goals.\n\nA population — any population — in a diverse land finds itself facing a choice of damned if you do and damned if you don't. The first option is assimilation, which means acting like whatever is de rigeur in the host population. This means abolishing your own identity, self-rule and standards, not to mention acting like a conquered population. Few want to do that, but the only alternative is to remain an isolated population that retains its own \"flavor\" like an ethnic restaurant, but ultimately must obey the laws of its host nation-state.\n\nIn the West, we have abandoned the indigenous model for the \"proposition nation\" which is the idea that we can bring in random people, teach them our laws and customs, and have them be just like us. Absolutely zero evidence suggests this is the case, but it is a popular notion and since people are equal, they have the freedom to believe in mass illusion of they so desire. The proposition nation requires that we use other populations like raw materials, bringing them in to the factory of our democracy and stamping them with the \"right\" opinions, producing a finished citizen-product at the other end of the democracy factory.\n\nWe saw this model fail time and again when applied under colonialism, so we brought it back home to keep trying to force our liberal ideas on an underlying order to the universe that clearly resists them. It is as if we are egomaniacs who refuse to believe the world is as it is because we want it to be otherwise, so we force it to conform where we can and when it does not do what we want, we ignore it and scapegoat something else. What we want to believe comes first before what we should know about reality because we, alone as individuals, are sovereign. There are no higher authorities above us, like kings, gods, culture or a historical heritage to uphold. It is just us, the egomaniac individuals who are both good consumers and good socialists, because we have made all of these things serve our vision.\n\nWe cannot blame Islam for resisting this mess, nor can we blame Islam for diversity's failing. Diversity fails no matter what the ingredients, and history shows us no healthy or successful examples, so blaming a group that does not fit in — like African-Americans in the USA, Jews in 1939 Germany, or Muslims in Europe — is as stupid as blaming quarters for the failing of a toll road. In addition to that, we should acknowledge that our society has become a miserably obedient place where jobs and shopping are more important than personal self-development, having a soul, achieving mental clarity or even having free time to get to know ourselves and each other. We have made a dystopia by achieving our Utopia of the equal worker.\n\nThe media pundits seek scapegoats for the failure of liberal capitalist democracy in the West. We do not need scapegoats; we need to look at the problem: liberal democracy and its partners equality, feminism, multiculturalism and civil rights are themselves part of a failing model that has also failed throughout history. Islam is just the latest scapegoat to be blamed because Muslims have noticed that the West is delusional, collapsing and easily conquered by those who are tired of being a minority.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus."}
{"text": "By Andrew M. Seaman\n\nA girl helps herself to a buffet at a fast food restaurant in Harlem in New York December 16, 2009. REUTERS/Finbarr O'Reilly\n\n(Reuters Health) - - People were less likely to go to the hospital with heart attacks or strokes after several counties in New York State restricted the use of trans fats, according to a new study.\n\nTrans fats raise bad cholesterol, lower good cholesterol and ultimately increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. They're found naturally in some foods but are often manufactured and added to processed foods to improve taste and texture.\n\n\"New York City was progressive and they enacted restrictions on trans fats, but no one looked to see if this made measurable changes to outcomes,\" said study lead author Dr. Eric Brandt, of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nNew York City limited the use of trans fats starting in July 2007. The restrictions applied to food purchased outside of stores, such as at restaurants, street vendors and bakeries, in the city's five counties. Other New York counties took similar actions after New York City's measure was enacted.\n\nPrevious research found that death from cardiovascular disease declined 4.5 percent within a year after counties enacted trans fat restrictions, the researchers write in JAMA Cardiology. No study looked at non-fatal cardiovascular issues like hospitalizations due to heart attacks and strokes, however.\n\nFor the new study, the researchers compared data on people hospitalized between 2002 and 2013 for heart attacks or strokes in counties that did or didn't restrict trans fats.\n\nAltogether they had data on 3.3 million people in 25 counties without trans fat restrictions and 8.4 million people in 11 counties with restrictions.\n\nIn 2006, there were 753 hospital admissions for heart attack or stroke per 100,000 people in counties that never enacted restrictions compared to 726 per 100,000 people in counties that put restrictions in place.\n\nWhile admissions for heart attacks and strokes fell after 2002 in all the counties, the drop was more substantial in those that enacted trans fat restrictions, the authors found.\n\nAfter three years or more, the combined rate of hospitalizations for heart attacks or strokes was about 6 percent lower in the counties with trans fat regulations.\n\nAdmissions for heart attacks were nearly 8 percent lower in counties with restrictions. Similarly, admissions for strokes were about 4 percent lower in counties with restrictions, but that finding could be due to chance.\n\nBrandt told Reuters Health that New York City was also pushing other public health initiatives around the same time. Those included clean air initiatives and showing calorie counts on restaurant menus.\n\nWhen they removed New York City data to make sure those other factors weren't driving the findings, the pattern didn't change.\n\n\"We still found the same thing,\" Brandt said.\n\nStill, the study can't say the trans fat restrictions caused fewer admissions in those counties.\n\nBrandt and colleagues write that in 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) removed manufactured trans fats from its list of safe food additives. By 2018, those fats will be nearly eliminated from American diets, they add.\n\n\"There has been a lot of looking into whether trans fats are harmful,\" said Brandt. \"Here we find on a population level when we restrict them, it benefits society by reducing heart attacks and strokes.\"\n\nThe findings suggest the FDA's action will lead to health benefits across the country, he added.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2otJ6gK JAMA Cardiology, online April 12, 2017."}
{"text": "The documentation describes override as:\n\nAn override method is a way of explicitly saying \"I am overriding this method from my superclass\". You can call super within this method, and it will work as expected. The same thing can be accomplished with a normal method call and the SUPER:: pseudo-package; it is really your choice.\n\nWhat you are doing contradicts this definition. With a role, f is installed in your package. You are attempting to define another f in the same package.\n\nThe fact that your role is called Base indicates to me that you have some confusion when it comes to the difference between inheritance versus composition.\n\nThe purpose of around is to wrap a method in the current class regardless of whether it was implemented in the same package or inherited or composed:\n\nMethod modifiers can be used to add behavior to methods without modifying the definition of those methods.\n\nJust a straightforward reading of these two snippets makes the distinction clear to me.\n\nWhen you apply the role that defines f , that itself overrides any inherited method f . If you then say override 'f' , you are declaring your intention to override f again. Well, there can only be one method f in one class. Which one should count? The one that you get by applying the role, or the one you just defined? For all intents and purposes, the methods you get from composing a role are just like methods you defined manually in the class. There is no reason a priori one should be more important than the other.\n\nThink of this as airline travel. Think of the method modifiers as classes: First, business, economy etc. So, in first class, get_dinner_menu maybe wrapped with appetizers, sweets, desserts etc.\n\nOn the other hand, override is like changing the flight. It's as if you are saying \"I want to fly on both TK 1 and UIA 213\". Makes no sense.\n\nMaybe the following script will make things a bit clearer by showing a naive implementation of around and overriding a method without using override .\n\n#!/usr/bin/env perl use strict; use warnings; { package MyRole; use Moose::Role; sub f { print \"in role\n\n\"; } } { package X; use Moose; with 'MyRole'; around 'f' => sub { my ($orig, $self) = @_; print \"In wrapper\n\n\"; return $self->$orig( @_ ); }; { my $f = \\&f; { no warnings 'redefine'; *f = sub { my ($self) = @_; print \"In wrapper wrapper\n\n\"; return $self->$f( @_ ); } } } } { package Y; use Moose; with 'MyRole'; sub f { print \"In overridden method\n\n\"; } } print '=-=' x 22, \"\n\n\"; my $x = X->new; $x->f; print '=-=' x 22, \"\n\n\"; my $y = Y->new; $y->f;\n\nOutput:\n\n=-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-= In wrapper wrapper In wrapper in role =-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-= In overridden method"}
{"text": "By Whitney Webb\n\nEven though Fukushima was the worst environmental disaster to have taken place in the last 30 years, you probably haven't heard much about it. After the Tohoku earthquake in eastern Japan and subsequent tsunami, one of the cooling systems at Fukushima's Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) nuclear power plant failed. The result was a devastating triple reactor meltdown that led to the evacuation of over half a million people and the creation of a 20-kilometer exclusion zone.\n\nEver since the disaster, TEPCO as well as the Japanese government have consistently tried to downplay the disaster's impacts nationally and globally. The collusion was so blatant that even TEPCO's company president, Naomi Hirose, admitted that a \"cover-up\" had taken place.\n\nHowever, some of Fukushima's effects are so obvious that even the Japanese government cannot continue to deny the enormity of the 2011 disaster. Within the last five years, many of the workers present at the Fukushima nuclear plant during the meltdown, as well as those involved in its clean-up, have developed cancer. Of the numerous workers seeking compensation, only two workers with leukemia were found to be entitled to workplace compensation by the Japanese health ministry. Yet, neither of these workers have so far received any money from the government for their treatment.\n\nNow, that is set to change. On Friday, Japan's health ministry concluded that another worker, diagnosed with thyroid cancer three years ago, developed his illness due to radiation exposure during his time working for TEPCO. The man had worked at several nuclear power plants with the company between 1992 and 2012 and was present at the Fukushima plant during the disaster. The radiation present in the man's body was found to be about 150 millisieverts, with 140 of which were believed to be a result of the 2011 disaster. This marks the first time that a former worker with thyroid cancer has won the right to work-related compensation as many other similar cases were previously rejected by the Japanese government.\n\nThis most recent confirmed case of Fukushima-related cancer ultimately forced the hand of the Japanese government, prompting them to release their overall position on workers compensation for those who worked at the plant before and after the catastrophe. Officials said that workers who had been exposed to over 100 millisieverts and developed cancer five years or more after the disaster were entitled to compensation, though this quantity of radiation was said to be a \"yardstick\" – not a strict standard. According to a joint study by the UN and TEPCO, about 174 former workers are believed to have been exposed to over 100 millisieverts of radiation. However, the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun reported that more than 2,000 workers have radiation exceeding 100 millisieverts in their thyroid gland alone.\n\nThough this new policy is good news for former TEPCO employees, it does little to address the growing epidemic of thyroid cancer among Fukushima citizens. Thyroid cancer rates have soared since the disaster. The trend is particularly noticeable among Fukushima's youngest residents as 131 children have been diagnosed with thyroid cancer since 2011.\n\nDespite the spike in thyroid cancer, the Japanese government, TEPCO, and even the United Nations have insisted that there is \"no direct link\" between exposure to Fukushima radiation and thyroid cancer. However, exposure to Iodine-131, the main radionuclide released into the air and water during the meltdown, is known to increase one's risk of thyroid cancer and is the most clearly defined environmental factor associated with thyroid tumors. If the Japanese government is offering compensation to workers for radiation exposure, it must also extend help to the disaster's youngest victims."}

{"text": "Hiking rain jackets don't keep you dry in the rain; they keep you warm. If you don't believe me, go hiking in the rain for 4+ hours and see if the clothing inside your jacket stays dry. Unless you're hiking someplace with extremely low humidity, I bet the clothing under your jacket will get wet, if not soaked-through by sweat and condensation. Like so-called waterproof hiking boots, hiking rain jackets are another item of hiking gear where the expectations don't match the results.\n\nWhich is why, you should think of a hiking rain jacket as a wet suit that will keep you warm when you're wet, instead of preventing you from getting wet.\n\nHow Wet Suits Work\n\nWet suits are not meant to keep you entirely dry. Instead, they trap a thin layer of water between your body and the suit. This layer of water is warmed by your body, to prevent you from loosing too much heat while in the water.\n\nWet suits are made of neoprene, which is made of small closed cells that are filled with air and provide insulation against cold water by trapping heat in.\n\nHow to Make Your Rain Jacket Work Like a Wet Suit\n\nThe key to making your rain jacket work like a wet suit depends on what mid-layer insulation you wear. Since rain jackets are only like an outer skin, you're going to want to wear a mid-layer that can trap air that you can warm with your body heat, but that won't be compromised by the condensation that occurs on the inside of your jacket when it begins to rain.\n\nThe best mid-layers for this purpose are fleece or wool pullovers, worn over a synthetic or wool baselayer. Fleece is a hydrophobic material, holding less than 1% of its weight in water and retains much of its insulating powers even when wet. It also dries much faster than wool. While Wool also retains warmth when wet, it absorbs up to 30% of its weight in water and takes longer to dry.\n\nWhatever you do. Don't wear cotton, hemp, bamboo, or other garments made with plant-based fibers as mid-layer and base-layer garments under a rain jacket. These materials soak up so much water that they can't retain warm air. The water fills up all of the air spaces in the fabric and your body can't generate enough warmth to warm it up.\n\nWhat Good is a Rain Jacket Then?\n\nWhy bother with a rain jacket if it just makes your mid-layer wet in rain from condensation or by trapping your sweat? Good question.\n\nRain shells, like house wrap, trap heat when worn so it doesn't escape. They also help prevent something called evaporative cooling, which occurs when wind or air comes in contact with your torso and legs and causes evaporation to occur. Evaporation sucks heat out of your body – which is why the process of sweating cools you.\n\nYou can break the \"evaporative chain\" by wearing an insulating mid-layer like a fleece pullover, which preserves the air space around your body, and keeps the thin-film of wetness (caused by condensation) between its outer surface and inside of your rain jacket.\n\nWhile the combination of an insulating mid-layer and rain jacket doesn't work exactly the same way as a wet suit, the underlying principles are quite similar. Your body heats the air trapped by your mid-layer, while your rain jacket keeps the resulting warmth from escaping.\n\nSee Also\n\nMost Popular Searches"}
{"text": "About\n\nThe Babadook is a 2014 indie psychological horror film directed by Jennifer Kent in her directorial debut. The film was a huge critical success and made 2.5 times its budget. It has spawned a devoted fanbase, including an ironic gay fandom that has adopted the title monster as a gay icon.\n\nPlot\n\nThe Babadook centers around a mother and child living in the aftermath of the father's death, which occurred when he was driving the mother to the hospital as she was in labor. The child, Samuel, is difficult, and the mother, Amelia, is exhausted with the behavior of her son. One night, they read a pop-up book called The Babadook, which has mysteriously appeared in their house. The book tells the story of Mister Babadook, a tall man in black with a top hat who, once let in, cannot be eradicated until he kills the host. Amelia is disturbed by the graphic story and Samuel becomes convinced the monster is real. As the story unfolds, Amelia grows increasingly manic as she is unable to tell what is real and what isn't, and is perhaps becoming infested with the Babadook.\n\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe film was Kent's first full-length film and was produced on a budget of $2.5 million. It was shot in Adelaide, Australia and interior shots were mostly filmed in a soundstage. A Victorian terrace house was built specifically for the film. It premiered in January of 2014 at the Sundance Film Festival and had a limited run in Australia that year, premiering in just 13 theaters. It initially opened in only 3 theaters in the United States. However, following positive critical reception, it was able to grow to a massive success.\n\nReception\n\nThe film was very positively reviewed, with a 98% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and an 86 rating on Metacritic. Critics praised the film's moving story and commitment to horror without jump scares, as well as the performances from the two leads.\n\nFandom\n\nFan reception to the film has been strong as well. On Facebook, The Babadook has over 160,000 likes. There is also a large amount of fan art on DeviantArt devoted to The Babadook. One notable instance of Babadook fandom was posted to Twitter on June 30th, 2016, when writer Katie Dippold tweeted about a Halloween party she attended dressed as the Babadook only to discover it wasn't a costume party (shown below). Her tweet gained over 76,000 retweets and 146,000 likes and was covered by New York Magazine.\n\n\nGay Icon\n\nIn early 2017, a joke that The Babadook was gay began spreading through Tumblr and eventually Twitter. On December 10th, 2016, Tumblr user Taco-bell-rey uploaded a screenshot of The Babadook appearing in the LGBT section of Netflix. The post gained over 126,000 notes, and likely launched the idea that The Babadook was a gay character and icon.\n\n\nThe idea continued to spread throughout Tumblr as ironic, trolling discourse. On February 15th, 2017, Twitter user @Broderick uploaded screenshots of such dialogue, gaining over 5,000 retweets (shown below).\n\n\nThe meme drew its most attention when June, LGBT Pride Month, began. Then, the jokes about Babadook's gay identity spread with such fervor they were covered by Mashable and Teen Vogue (examples shown below). As of June 7th, much of the Tumblr discourse around the Babadook centers around him being a gay icon.\n\n\nSearch Interest\n\nExternal References"}
{"text": "Conservatives have long viewed the Black Lives Matter movement with skepticism and questioned the group's tactics, but this week pundits grabbed hold of a new label for the organization: hate group.\n\nAfter the Friday shooting death of a sheriff's deputy in Texas and a Black Lives Matter protest at the Minnesota State Fair on Saturday, conservatives doubled down in their criticism. Numerous hosts at Fox News took issue with the group's recent chant in Minnesota, \"pigs in a blanket, fry 'em like bacon,\" tying that protest to recent deaths of police officers.\n\nDuring a segment on the shooting and protest on Monday morning, \"Fox and Friend\" co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck asked why Black Lives Matter has not yet been labeled a hate group.\n\n\"Why has the Black Lives Matter movement not been classified yet as a hate group?\" she asked conservative African-American writer Kevin Jackson. \"How much more has to go in this direction before someone actually labels it as such?\"\n\nJackson agreed with Hasselbeck's suggestion that the movement is a hate group. Following media coverage of her comment on Monday, Hasselbeck published a tweet on Tuesday noting that it's her job to ask questions.\n\nMy calling @foxandfriends is to ask questions and my calling as a #Christian is to #LoveAllGodsPeople -I give my best to do both each day. — elisabeth hasselbeck (@ehasselbeck) September 1, 2015\n\nConservatives continued on Monday and Tuesday to link the Black Lives Matter movement to violence against police officers.\n\nOn Monday night, Fox's Bill O'Reilly said he was sure that the shooting and the protest were in some way connected, and he labeled Black Lives Matter a \"hate group\" because \"they hate police officers\" and \"want them dead.\"\n\n\"These people, after the death, the murder of this deputy, went out and said, 'We want more police officers killed,'\" he said.\n\n\"They're a hate group, and I'm going to tell you right now, I'm going to put them out of business,\" O'Reilly added later.\n\nOn Tuesday night, O'Reilly brought on two guests to discuss whether Black Lives Matter should be linked to violence against cops.\n\n\"Do you believe that the Black Lives Matter crew and and other radicals are igniting violence against cops?\" he asked. Yet neither guest agreed with the Fox host that the group should be linked to the recent shooting death of police officers.\n\nLater on Tuesday night, conservative writer Katie Pavlich told Fox's Megyn Kelly that Black Lives Matter \"promotes the execution of police officers.\"\n\nDuring a Monday appearance on Fox News' \"The Five,\" comedian Tom Shillue said that Black Lives Matter is a \"violent group.\"\n\n\"I mean, this is like a criminal organization,\" he said. \"I think it's time to arrest these leaders because they're threatening people and they're causing violence.\"\n\nDuring the same segment, Fox host Eric Bolling speculated that Black Lives Matter protests \"probably had some effect on\" the Friday night shooting.\n\nAlthough conservative outrage over the Black Lives Matter protest in Minnesota bubbled over into talk of hate groups just this week, the hosts at Fox News have been shaking their fists at the organization for a while, with O'Reilly leading the charge. In July, he said Black Lives Matter activists were engaging in \"Gestapo tactics\" and that they are \"only interested in condemning white society.\" He also suggested that the organization is \"an anarchistic group\" that \"wants to tear down the country.\""}
{"text": "LAST month a business student at Korea University in Seoul posted a large bulletin on a wall in the university grounds. In bold black pen, Ju Hyun-woo recounted the week's events: thousands of railway workers dismissed for striking; the suicide of a farmer in protest at the construction of electricity pylons near his village; and the conservative ruling party's proposal to expel an opposition politician for questioning the legitimacy of the president, Park Geun-hye. Mr Ju asked readers: \"How are you all feeling nowadays?\"\n\nAnswers came in thick and fast, and most people said they were not fine. Within a few days dozens of handwritten posters—known as daejabo—were pinned up next to his, on issues ranging from high gas bills to gay rights. Now Mr Ju reckons almost 1,000 have been tacked onto university walls around the country. Students in Japan, America, China and Chile have followed, posting pictures of their posters on the \"Can't be OK\" Facebook page, which gathered 260,000 followers in a week.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\nSocial media have long been a haven for anonymous dissenting voices in South Korea. But Mr Ju says he wanted to \"take responsibility\" for his poster: he signed it and stood in front of it for ten hours, engaging passers-by. Breaking with a tradition of politically charged, militant daejabo, used in the past by Korean students to demand change, Mr Ju left readers to come up with their own grievances—and answers.\n\nThe group's catchphrase, an everyday greeting, has potential to unite not just students but disgruntled workers, housewives and high-school pupils, says Park Mi, the author of a book on Korean student movements. An opposition politician has used it in a daejabo he posted in offices in South Korea's National Assembly, promising to work harder to help those who are \"not fine\". On January 1st a man calling for the president's resignation died after setting himself on fire—a rare form of dissent associated with the heyday of activism in the 1980s against the then military dictator. (Park Geun-hye happens to be the daughter of South Korea's longest-running dictator, killed by his spy chief in 1979.) Police found the man's last diary entry, entitled \"How are you nowadays?\".\n\nThe connection to the 1980s protests has awakened memories of students bringing down regimes. But Park Mi points out that the \"How are you?\" protest is not a revolutionary one like that in the 1980s, the aim of which was to end the dictatorship. If today's student rebels have a cause, it is a highly diffuse one.\n\nFor Mr Ju the biggest problem is that Koreans do not ask themselves \"if they are OK\". And they put up with limitations on free expression. Police stood behind barricades in front of daejabo posted on the back gate of Seoul's government complex on December 19th, preventing people from reading them. The education ministry warned high schools that posters could have a \"negative effect on the learning environment\". Some schools have cut class discussion time; a school in Seoul's Gangnam district destroyed a daejabo by one of its pupils (he has taken the case to the human-rights court).\n\nMost participants have now taken down their own daejabo—including Mr Ju himself, whose poster will be preserved in Korea University's museum as the \"document of a democratic movement\". For Mr Ju such posters are meant to be temporary. They are, he says, \"just the beginning\"."}
{"text": "By David Roberts\n\n14 June 2017\n\n(Vox) – In September 2016, speaking to an audience of fossil fuel executives at a Shale Insight conference in Pittsburgh, Donald Trump promised, \"Oh, you will like me so much.\"\n\nThey didn't give him much money during his campaign, presumably because, like most people, they were confident he wouldn't win. But they made up for it quickly after the election. According to an analysis by the Center for Public Integrity, \"oil, gas and coal companies and executives contributed more than $1 out of every $10 raised for Trump's inauguration, for which he raised nearly $107 million overall\" (a new record).\n\nThe love affair between Trump and fossil fuel companies has blossomed ever since. Recently, Kathleen Sgamma, president of the oil and gas trade group Western Energy Alliance, gushed to the New York Times, \"not in our wildest dreams, never did we expect to get everything.\"\n\n\"Everything,\" in this case, denotes a long list of friendly appointments and regulatory rollbacks. For all its controversies, distractions, failures, and unfilled jobs, the Trump administration has been steady and true in its devotion to fossil fuel interests, giving them a greater presence inside executive agencies, stripping them of regulatory restraints, and proposing to defund their competitors.\n\nThere are some areas of policy where Trump faces friction from courts, Congress, or other elements of the conservative coalition. He has stumbled on health care, on his travel ban, and on foreign policy. But when it comes to environmental and energy policy, the coalition is aligned. All the party's most powerful and influential factions support a pro-fossil, anti-regulatory agenda; there is an extensive infrastructure of big money, think tanks, and lobbyists built to support it.\n\nIt's worth noting that a pro-fossil fuel, anti-regulatory approach is not particularly popular in the US, in either party. Majorities in every congressional district support limiting local pollution and carbon emissions from coal plants. Majorities in every Congressional district believe America's focus should turn toward wind and solar. Majorities in every state support the Paris climate agreement.\n\nBut the money and intensity on the GOP side support fossil fuels. And there is no faction on the right that cares enough about climate or environmental issues to prioritize them over the larger culture war. So there is no friction.\n\nThe relative lack of conflict makes the fossil fuel takeover quieter than other parts of the Trump reality show, but not for lack of activity. Trump has moved aggressively to make good on his promises.\n\nIn its first 100 days, the administration overturned, reversed, or suspended 23 environmental rules and regulations. Even the White House website has vanished any mention of climate change and replaced it with a paean to energy production.\n\nIt's been a full-court press. In this post, I'm going to review a few of the highlights — some of the people with whom the administration is staffing its agencies, as well as a few of the rule and procedure changes it has already put in place. It is by no means comprehensive (and will likely soon be out of date), but it should offer some perspective on the sheer breadth of the administration's work on behalf of fossil fuels.\n\nLike so many areas of Trump policy, it is reminiscent of George W. Bush's administration, only more shameless. It is too soon to say if Trump will be \"worse than Bush\" on this score, but it's already clear that he feels less of a need to cover his decisions with a veneer of \"balance.\" [more]"}
{"text": "What is Marital Property and How is it Divided During Divorce?\n\nThe courts have no authority over non-marital property. So, the first thing the court has to do is determine whether they have authority over marital property. Generally speaking, all property acquired by either spouse before the marriage is considered non-marital property. All property acquired after the marriage is considered property of the marriage or marital property.\n\nIf the property is marital property then the court must \"equitably\" divide the property.\n\nIf you wish to keep separate, your property from your spouse's property safeguards should be put into place to make sure that each retains ownership of their individual property. For example, if you own a home and marry, the only way to keep that home from becoming marital property is to make sure your spouse makes no financial investment in the home.\n\nProperty Is Presumed To Be Marital Property Except For:\n\nProperty acquired by gift, legacy or descent.\n\nProperty acquired in exchange for property acquired before the marriage or in exchange for property acquired by gift, legacy or descent.\n\nProperty acquired by a spouse after a Judgment of Legal Separation.\n\nProperty excluded by valid agreement of the parties.\n\nAny judgment or property obtained by judgment awarded to a spouse from the other spouse.\n\nProperty acquired before the marriage.\n\nWhen marital and non-marital property has been combined the process of determining marital property can be quite complicated. For example, what happens when one spouse uses non-marital property such as an inheritance to buy a house with the other spouse? What happens when one spouse inherits money and that money is put in a joint bank account?\n\nIn such situations, that property becomes marital property. Once any non-marital property is used to benefit both spouses or, co-mingled in an account in both spouse's names it becomes marital property and is will be equitably split between the spouses during divorce.\n\nIf a court decides that property is marital property then the court must determine how to \"equitably\" split the property. State divorce laws differ on the meaning of \"equitable\" and most states do not consider \"equitable\" to mean equal.\n\nWhen Dividing Marital Property The Courts Consider The Following:\n\nThe contribution of each party to the acquisition, preservation, or increase or decrease in value of the marital or non-marital property, including the contribution of a spouse as a homemaker or to the family unit.\n\nThe dissipation by each spouse of the marital or non-marital property.\n\nThe value of the property assigned to each spouse.\n\nThe duration of the marriage.\n\nThe economic circumstances of each spouse when the division of property is to become effective, including the desirability of awarding the family home, or the right to live in the home for a reasonable period, to the spouse having custody of the children.\n\nAny obligation and rights arising from a prior marriage of either party.\n\nAny post-nuptial agreement of the parties.\n\nThe age, health, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, marketable skills, estate, liabilities, and needs of each of the parties.\n\nThe custodial needs of any children.\n\nThe reasonable opportunity of each spouse for future acquisition of capital assets and income, the tax consequences of the property division upon the respective economic circumstances of the parties.\n\nIt is important that you hire an attorney who is familiar with your state's laws and how your particular court jurisdiction normally handles property distribution in order to help you resolve this very complicated issue."}
{"text": "I am Jordan Roberts, the graphic designer behind a board game that raised over $93,000+ on our first Kickstarter which became a staff favorite. Emergence was my biggest design project to date and I wanted to share how we allow players to become a permanent part of the game by creating their own custom map and thematic backstory.\n\nIn Emergence, players are a member of the majority A.I. team or the minority Human team. Players must traverse the city collecting data, as they look to gain knowledge for their team and identify the secret humans among them. With the city being a main factor in replay ability, we know we wanted to include custom ideas that would change the feeling of the game each time we replayed it.\n\nWith Emergence, an early design idea was to create a hexagonal game-board, much like many other games (such as the Settlers of Catan ), that would allow players to re-arrange a city layout. Not only does this drastically add to replay-ability but it gives players a sense of ownership—which we thought played well with the social aspect of the game. Players can create cities with specific strategies based on the layout: choke-points, specifically placed data compilers, small pockets of rare resources, narrow passages ripe for conflict, all of these would create a different experience each time they play. We also quickly realized that resource collection (one main aspect of the game) would benefit from a hex-based map that gave players more movement options. Alongside the mechanics, we decided that we wanted to create a game with the theme and backstory that matched those mechanics (Evolution is a great example). We figured a game that players could contribute toward strategically and creatively would be something they were vested in. By flushing out the dystopic A.I. vs Humanity theme, custom cities weren't merely player-created maps but, instead, became something integral to the story behind the game. Testing labs now underground tombs, mutated forests now riddled with valuable bio-data, manmade monuments turned resistance strongholds—by giving players a context, we would hopefully give them some inspiration to participate.\n\nAnd that is when we came to our City Database idea. After some play-throughs at a local game store, we realized people were interested in creating a map of their own. So we decided we would create a space on our website for people to contribute their city designs along with a backstory. It was a way for players to form a community around the game and really take their sense of ownership to a higher level. Their creation and story could be out there for the world to see… and play! What's especially cool about the Database is it allows us, as the creators, to let the people be heard (aka sit back and be lazy). While we still enjoy creating maps of our own (which can also be found in the Database), it's even better to see what the fans of Emergence have come up with. Plus, we like to give our fans some shine. What better way to start a game night by exploring a city (with a backstory) you can tell your friends that you personally created?\n\nSo far, we've been slowly receiving submissions from all over the world, most of which we try to play test among our design-team before we post to the Database. We do encourage people to at least play the game a few times before jumping into city-creation as people will quickly find how tough it can be to make a balanced, playable map. And if you just want to make a city shaped like your sister's head…that's cool too.\n\n\nCheck out the database here."}
{"text": "Nearly every poll and mainstream media outlet predicted that Hillary Clinton would win the 2016 election, and her loss was an embarrassment for the Clinton establishment and Democratic Party. Since the election, the Clintons and their loyalists have been pursuing a calculated public relations campaign to rehabilitate the damaged Clinton brand. This signals an eventual return to politics for Hillary Clinton and the beginning of a political career for Chelsea Clinton.\n\nLess than a week after the election, rumors began circulating that Chelsea Clinton was being groomed for a congressional run. Though Chelsea denied rumors that she planned on running for the Senate in 2020, rumors about a congressional run have persisted. Chelsea Clinton has received an immense about of media coverage for criticizing Trump on Twitter. Several mainstream media outlets have sensationalized even her benign tweets, such as a post about spinach pancakes. On March 16, several media outlets reported that Chelsea Clinton would be publishing a children's book, exploiting for monetary gain the widely touted slogan \"she persisted,\" which was developed by Democrats in response to Sen. Elizabeth Warren being silenced by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for reading a letter Coretta Scott King wrote about Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the 1980s. Chelsea Clinton running for Congress in 2018 would be disastrous; anointing another out-of-touch Clinton to serve as a spokesperson for the Democratic Party would repel even more voters than Hillary Clinton's candidacy did.\n\nHillary Clinton has received similar attention from the media. Though being a former presidential candidate warrants some of it, her appearances, tweets and messages to the public have been opportunistically orchestrated to maximize the public relations benefits to her career. After her election loss, supporters posted selfies with Clinton hiking in the woods, which mainstream media outlets covered ad nauseam. \"It was a very dark day yesterday. I just feel like the fact I ran into Hillary while I was trying to clear my head, was sort of like a hopeful sign. I hope the picture brings hope to people who need it,\" a Clinton supporter who encountered Clinton in the woods two days after the election told CNN. Clinton's first public appearances after the election were in environments where she was sure to be lavished with praise and admiration: a visit to to a Children's Defense Fund event, surprising Katy Perry with an award and attending a Broadway show at which she received a standing ovation. In the media, rumors began circulating that Clinton was considering running again in 2020. Even more widely circulated was the rumor that she will run for mayor of New York City. Every Clinton tweet has received a flood of media coverage. The first plans she announced post-election were predictably self-serving; she finalized a lucrative book deal for her memoir, is reissuing her 1996 ghostwritten children's book It Takes a Village and is returning to the highly paid speech circuit.\n\nOn March 17, Clinton foreshadowed a return to the public spotlight at the Society of Irish Women's 19th Annual St. Patrick's Day dinner in Scranton, Pa. She told attendees of the event, \"I am ready to come out of the woods and to shine a light on what's already happening around kitchen tables at dinners like this to help draw strength to enable everyone to keep going. That's the spirit of Scranton.\"\n\nHillary Clinton is still held in high regard by the political establishment. The Democratic Party has focused on making excuses and blaming others over recognizing flaws in Hillary Clinton's campaign. However, Clinton remains widely disliked in the public. Her favorability rating is at 40 percent, which is even lower than Donald Trump's. With Clinton's resurgence looming, the Democratic Party has failed to enact reforms that should have resulted from handing the presidency to Donald Trump and majorities in Congress to Republicans."}
{"text": "With Segregated Witness finally activating on the Bitcoin network, a lot of people expected another major BTC price jump. That is not exactly how things went, as the Bitcoin price actually took a slight hit over the subsequent hours. This seemingly confirms that the price already accounted for Segregated Witness becoming a part of Bitcoin. It is a bit unclear how things will evolve from here on out, as there seems to be no urgency to continued moves in either direction.\n\nNo Bitcoin Price Action Despite SegWit Activation\n\nA lot of interesting things have happened in the world of Bitcoin these past few weeks. First of all, virtually all mining pools came together to lock in the activation of Segregated Witness on the network. Considering how the largest pools actively opposed this implementation for nearly a full year, it was considered a major victory for the ecosystem as a whole when things finally fell into place. It is worth noting the same level of collaboration had ensured Litecoin would receive Segregated Witness well before Bitcoin did.\n\nWith the activation locked in successfully about two weeks ago, the community was abuzz with excitement. As soon as the lock-in was confirmed, we saw the Bitcoin price respond in a positive manner. It allowed the price to reach several new all-time highs in quick succession, but things have since gone quiet. This doesn't mean the Bitcoin price lost value, mind you, as it still hovers around the US$4,175 mark as we speak. However, there have been no further major increases all week.\n\nIn fact, all we have seen has been a slow but steady decline of the Bitcoin price until 48 hours ago. At that point, all losses sustained during the days prior were regained. It is still unclear why the Bitcoin price took the downturn it did over the past few weeks, but cryptocurrency markets have always been pretty volatile, to say the least. With the market recovering slowly but surely, it seems we are back to where we started around a week ago. That is good news, all things considered.\n\nHowever, a lot of people had expected more Bitcoin price momentum given the fact SegWit was finally activated on the network. In fact, several events were organized around the world to celebrate the SegWit activation. So far, it appears the overall community cares a lot more about this feat than the actual traders and market makers do. After all, the activation was a guarantee two weeks ago, and nothing has changed now that it is active on the network.\n\nMore to the point, it appears most traders had factored the SegWit aspect into the Bitcoin price. That is not entirely surprising, as there was no way the activation could have been avoided. It is of more importance how things proceed from here on out. Especially with SegWit2x still being a somewhat viable option, there will be some tough decisions to be made in the coming weeks and months. Moreover, once the Lightning Network launches on the main net, we may see some major Bitcoin price action.\n\nUntil that happens, the most logical outcome for the Bitcoin price appears to be a lot of sideways trading momentum. There is plenty of trading volume every day, but it will take a lot more effort to generate any price swings in the future. With various altcoins having recently gained in value, a lot of traders have high hopes for the alternative cryptocurrency market as far as short-term gains are considered. This also explains why we see multiple altcoin/bitcoin trading markets generating more volume than some fiat currency-oriented pairs. All things considered, the Bitcoin price is fine for now, but it is doubtful we will see any major action over the next few days."}

She is one of the few girls in the U.S. to play in the predominantly male sport, according to the National Federation of High School Associations.\n\nWhile most girls choose to play in the less contact-oriented positions, like kicker and wide receiver, according to coach Glashagel, Emmerling plays in the trenches, blocking the biggest guys of the opposing team.\n\n\"I've loved football since I was little. I always watched it with my dad,\" said Emmerling. \"This year, I thought, 'I'm going to try it and, if I like it and I if I have time to do it, then I'm going for it.'\"\n\nAfter talking with Glashagel the previous year, he told her she could join and explained what it would take to participate. He gave her exercises, plays and drills to work on over the summer, as well as a helmet and shoulder pads.\n\nGlashagel described how several girls over the years had asked to play but none of them actually came out to practice.\n\n\"I was skeptical because I've had girls say they wanted to play, but it never panned out,\" said Glashagel. \"It's awesome. The newness of it, especially with the players and the coaches, kind of wore off. It's at the point now that it's accepted and no big deal.\"\n\nThe coaches evaluated her skills and looked at what was best for her and the team, and they decided that she would play offensive guard.\n\nEmmerling is the shortest player on the team at 5 feet, 4 inches and weighing 159 pounds, and sometimes she is a little intimidated by some of the other players. But when it's game time, she is ready.\n\n\"I've got a lot of power in me, and when I get on the field it doesn't scare me. I'm ready to play and I've got so much adrenaline rushing through me,\" Emmerling said.\n\nShe says all of her teammates have been very supportive and that she hasn't had one bad experience.\n\nHer friend and teammate, running back Griffin Hill, confirmed her assertions.\n\n\"I actually think it's pretty cool for someone to have the courage and go out and do that,\" Hill said. \"She's just like another person on the team.\"\n\nAs game day approaches, she is excited about the thought of playing. She realizes she is the only girl on the field and feels it is amazing to be competing against boys who don't know about her.\n\nDuring a recent home game against North Chicago on a cool autumn night, Emmerling's name was called and she had an opportunity to play. After the huddle broke, Emmerling rushed to the line and crouched into her stance. The ball was snapped and she held her own against a bigger defensive lineman while the running back ran around the end and gained a few yards.\n\n\"It was just amazing,\" Emmerling said. \"To go out on that field and then hearing the play called. I made that block and I just felt so great to know that I could do it and that I had come so far.\""}

Worm Thrall costs one empty black soul gem, and turns the target into a zombie slave. Conjure Black Soul Gem does exactly what it sounds like. Imbue Worm Thrall only works on a Worm Thrall. It upgrades it into a stronger version, at the cost of another empty black soul gem and 100 health. The Tome of Unlife can also be used to combine soul gems to create stronger ones, and to summon an immortal skeleton companion called Creak. Lastly, the Tome makes the player count as a necromancer, making undead and necromancers friednly, and giving a -30 modifier towards the Mage's Guild.\n\n\nReading the Mysterium Xarxes lets summon Mehrunes Dagon.\n\n\nKilling Jyggalag lets you summon him.\n\n\nFinding the Great Welkynd Stone and Great Sigil Stone gives the player fragments of them, which are infinite use varla and sigil stones.\n\n\nEdgar also sells two new spells, True Invisibility and Hunter's Sight.

{"text": "Russia said Thursday it has withdrawn its world-beating team of racewalkers from all international competitions to avoid \"disgrace\" in the wake of a series of doping allegations.\n\nMore than 25 Russian walkers have been punished for doping in recent years, with at least 20 of them trained by coach Viktor Chegin, who is under investigation by athletics' world governing body and the Russian anti-doping agency.\n\nChegin also announced his retirement Thursday, Russian media reported\n\nRegional media in the city of Saransk, where Chegin serves as head coach of the national training center, reported that he had announced his retirement. He was not reported as giving a reason for his decision, but quoted by website Pro Gorod Saransk as saying that he hoped the investigation into his alleged involvement in doping would be \"objective and without pre-judgement'' and that he wished his team greater success in the future.\n\nSince the start of last year, four Russian Olympic racewalking champions have received doping bans.\n\nThe Russian athletics federation said in a statement that it has withdrawn its walkers from competitions \"to avoid causing damage to the image of Russian athletics and Russian sport as a whole.\"\n\nThe team will not compete until the Russian anti-doping agency finishes its investigation into Chegin, which was announced Wednesday.\n\nThat is \"99 percent\" likely to mean no Russian walkers will compete at next month's world athletics championships in Beijing, the federation's acting president Vadim Zelichenok told Russia's R-Sport agency. The only chance for them to compete will be if the investigation concludes very swiftly, he added.\n\n\"At the moment, there is the suspicion that this discipline [of athletes] could bring us disgrace at the world championships,\" Zelichenok said.\n\nZelichenok welcomed the news of Chegin's retirement.\n\n\"I heard he was supposed to make this statement. It's probably the only decision he could make in this situation,'' he told R-Sport. Zelichenok added that Chegin's national training center \"needs to be cleaned up'' but would not be closed. Two directors of the center, not including Chegin, have also been forced out in the past year because of doping bans.\n\nRussia won two of the three walk events at the 2013 world athletics championships. One of those gold medalists, Elena Lashmanova, was banned for doping a year later but kept her world gold medal and the Olympic gold she won in 2012.\n\nIn January, three more Olympic-champion Russian walkers were banned, leading to the resignations of both the president of the Russian athletics federation and the head coach.\n\nThe federation said Thursday that its athletes have been instructed not to work with Chegin or they could face sanctions. It was not immediately clear what this would mean for Russia's national walking training center, which is named in Chegin's honor and where he is the head coach. The federation, which does not directly oversee the center, said it had requested he be suspended from his job there.\n\nEarlier in the day, Russia swept the podium in the women's 10,000-meter walk at the European junior championships.\n\nThe Russian anti-doping agency said Wednesday that Chegin is suspected of having doping substances and either providing or attempting to provide them to unnamed athletes.\n\nBoth the World Anti-Doping Agency and track and field's world governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations, are also investigating Russian athletics as a whole after a German TV documentary, broadcast in December, alleged doping was commonplace and organized by senior officials."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON -- Arkansas passed a religious freedom bill on Tuesday that is similar to an Indiana law that has faced national backlash for legalizing discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.\n\nThe bill cleared the Arkansas Legislature and now heads to the governor's desk, where it is expected to be signed. Like the Indiana law, the Arkansas legislation allows a person who feels his or her exercise of religion has been \"substantially burdened\" to cite that argument as a claim or defense in a private lawsuit. The legislation also grants corporations the right to religious freedom. This language is not in the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), and critics say it could be used to override existing anti-discrimination protections.\n\n\"The Arkansas and Indiana bills are virtually identical in terms of language and intent,\" said Sarah Warbelow, legal director at the Human Rights Campaign. \"They place LGBT people, people of color, religious minorities, women and many more people at risk of discrimination.\"\n\nIndiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) defended his state's law on Tuesday, calling for a legislative fix that would clarify that the law does not allow businesses to discriminate. Earlier in the week, Arkansas lawmakers also tried to head off concerns about that state's bill, approving language that says \"the General Assembly finds that it is a compelling governmental interest to comply with federal civil rights laws.\"\n\nHowever, according to Eunice Rho, advocacy and policy counsel at the ACLU, federal civil rights laws have no explicit protections for LGBT people, and this legislative finding -- while helpful -- is not part of the law. \"If the Arkansas Legislature is serious about preventing discrimination, they need to write it into the actual code,\" she said.\n\n\"We would like to see both Indiana and Arkansas adopt language clarifying that the state RFRA cannot be used to undermine federal, state or local non-discrimination laws,\" Warbelow said.\n\nDuring Monday's committee hearing, some lawmakers raised concerns about the bill being inconsistent with federal and state RFRA laws when it comes to protecting civil rights. Some proposed a simple solution: adding a non-discrimination disclaimer to the legislation.\n\n\"It's not a philosophical debate with me at this point. I think we're going well beyond the other states,\" said state Rep. Camille Bennett (D), who ultimately voted against the bill.\n\nBut the bill's author, state Rep. Bob Ballinger (R), said its language was staying put, and that it would be too confusing to try to define what constitutes discrimination.\n\n\"If that means that you can force somebody who has deeply held religious beliefs to engage in some activity that violates their deeply held religious beliefs, and that the state has the right to force them into doing it, I can't say that I do agree with that,\" he said.\n\nArkansas is about to enter the same minefield that Indiana has been trapped in since Pence signed his religious freedom bill last week. In Indiana, major companies like Twitter and the NCAA, as well as celebrities like Apple CEO Tim Cook and Miley Cyrus, have spoken out against the law.\n\nIn Arkansas, both Walmart and Acxiom, a big data company, have spoken out against the legislation. The Democratic mayor of Little Rock also warned Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) on Tuesday that \"any piece of legislation that is so divisive cannot possibly be good for the state of Arkansas and its people.\"\n\nBut Hutchinson appears unfazed by these concerns. Last week, he vowed that he would sign the legislation: \"Arkansas is open for business, and we recognize and respect the diversity of our culture and economy,\" he said in a statement."}
{"text": "Get used to Obama and Netanyahu not seeing eye to eye.\n\nDon't be confused by the squirming disclaimers by U.S. spokespeople as they try every which way to quell the storm after anonymous senior officials called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \"chickenshit\" and various other invectives.\n\nThe denials from the White House and State Department sounded about as sincere as the semi-apology a few months ago by Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon after he called U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry \"messianic and obsessive.\" The crisis in ties between Israel and the United States is alive and well and here to stay.\n\nNetanyahu is convinced that this latest attack against him originates in U.S. President Barack Obama's closest inner circle. But even if Obama's senior advisers didn't make those remarks, as White House officials insist, or even if the officials quoted by Jeffrey Goldberg in The Atlantic spoke without authorization, their words faithfully represent the Oval Office's attitude toward Netanyahu.\n\nThe expressions used by those U.S. officials to refer to the prime minister also recall harsh things that a long line of American presidents and cabinet members have said about Netanyahu over the past 20 years.\n\nIn an article a few years ago, senior U.S. diplomat Aaron David Miller mentioned that Secretary of State James Baker had boycotted Netanyahu when the latter was deputy foreign minister and temporarily banned him from the State Department. And President Bill Clinton walked out furious from his first meeting with Netanyahu in 1996, wondering if the Israeli prime minister thought his country was the superpower.\n\nKeep updated: Sign up to our newsletter Email * Please enter a valid email address Sign up Please wait… Thank you for signing up.

Try again Thank you, The email address you have provided is already registered. Close\n\nBut why hark back to the distant past? The same Jeffrey Goldberg reported four years ago that then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates told Obama that Netanyahu was an ungrateful ally and that his policy on the Palestinian issue threatened Israel's future.\n\nThe U.S. officials behind the current attack were apparently trying to influence Israeli public opinion by revealing what the administration really thinks of Netanyahu; to signal to Israelis that their prime minister is seriously damaging strategic relations with the United States and endangering their national security.\n\nBut the insults and coarse language will produce the opposite, at least in the near term. Netanyahu, who believes he's already in an election campaign, took advantage of this incident to portray himself to Israelis as an innocent victim; someone being attacked simply because he's fighting to defend Israel's security interests and the Jewish people's holy places in Jerusalem.\n\nBeyond the release of steam and expression of frustrations the White House has accumulated about Netanyahu over the past five years, the latest attack is a harbinger of how Washington will conduct policy toward the Netanyahu government after next week's congressional elections, during Obama's last two years office. The close security and intelligence cooperation will continue, but America's diplomatic defense of Israel at the United Nations and other international forums will not be immediate and obvious.\n\nIn the face of the diplomatic attack Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas plans to launch against Israel at the United Nations, the Americans will suffice with casting their veto in the Security Council. But regarding anything else, they'll let Abbas run amok as he pleases.\n\nIt will be the same regarding European initiatives for sanctions against the settlements. As far as the Americans are concerned, Netanyahu can lie in the bed he has made for himself."}

Three others were involved in the accident.\n\nAccording the Santa Barbara news site, Noozhawk, the foreign students, two women and two men, were taking photos on the trestle when an Amtrak train approached. One woman suffered a fatal injury, being declared dead at the scene. The other woman had mild injuries and was taken to a nearby hospital.\n\nOne of the men was critically injured and was air lifted to the hospital. The other man was not injured.\n\nThe staff here at SLR Lounge are always saddened to hear of a preventable tragedy like this one, and would like to take this opportunity to remind our community about the dangers, not to mention the legal consequences, of trespassing on railroad property.\n\nIf you haven't already, please review the safety and legal guidelines in our article 4 REASONS YOU SHOULDN'T TAKE PORTRAITS ON RAILROAD TRACKS and the the follow up to that article, THE 5TH REASON PHOTOGRAPHERS SHOULD STAY OFF THE TRACKS.\n\nHere's a summary review of the Pedestrian Rail Safety Tips by Operation Lifesaver:\n\nThe only safe place to cross is at a designated public crossing with either a crossbuck, flashing red lights or a gate. If you cross at any other place, you are trespassing and can be ticketed or fined. Cross tracks ONLY at designated pedestrian or roadway crossings.\n\nRailroad tracks, trestles, yards and equipment are private property and trespassers are subject to arrest and fine. If you are in a rail yard uninvited by a railroad official you are trespassing and subject to criminal prosecution; you could be injured or killed in a busy rail yard.\n\nIt can take a mile or more to stop a train, so a locomotive engineer who suddenly sees someone on the tracks will likely be unable to stop in time. Railroad property is private property. For your safety, it is illegal to be there unless you are at a designated public crossing.\n\nTrains overhang the tracks by at least three feet in both directions; loose straps hanging from rail cars may extend even further. If you are in the right-of-way next to the tracks, you can be hit by the train.\n\nDo not cross the tracks immediately after a train passes. A second train might be blocked by the first. Trains can come from either direction. Wait until you can see clearly around the first train in both directions.\n\nFlashing red lights indicate a train is approaching from either direction. You can be fined for failure to obey these signals. Never walk around or behind lowered gates at a crossing, and DO NOT cross the tracks until the lights have stopped flashing and it's safe to do so.\n\nDo not {photograph}, hunt, fish or bungee jump from railroad trestles. There is only enough clearance on the tracks for a train to pass. Trestles are not meant to be sidewalks or pedestrian bridges! Never walk, run, cycle or operate all terrain vehicles (ATVs) on railroad tracks, rights-of-way or through tunnels.\n\nDo not attempt to hop aboard railroad equipment at any time. A slip of the foot can cost you a limb or your life.\n\nBe aware trains do not follow set schedules. Any Time is Train Time!\n\nPlease stay off the tracks and spread the word to other photographers, especially those who are new and may not be aware of the dangers.\n\nVia Noozhawk"}
{"text": "Canadian fighter jets helped to destroy heavy engineering equipment that was being used to divert the Euphrates River to flood areas nearby while denying water to Iraqi civilians further away, Lt.-Gen. Jonathan Vance said Tuesday.\n\nVance, the head of Canadian military operations, said Canadian aircraft have flown 27 operations in the fight against ISIS, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (also known as ISIL), with the fighter jets flying 18 of those.\n\nIn one case, the Canadian Aurora surveillance aircraft participated in \"the destruction of a key ISIL base,\" Vance said.\n\nShortly after Vance's briefing, senior defence officials also appeared before a House committee to take questions from MPs.\n\nOn Sunday, two CF-18s targeted ISIS positions with laser-guided GBU-12, 500-pound bombs \"in the vicinity of Fallujah,\" a large city in central Iraq about 70 kilometres west of the capital Baghdad, Defence Minister Rob Nicholson said in a statement that day.\n\nVance says the four targets were near a dam west of Fallujah and consisted of heavy engineering equipment and vehicles.\n\n\"They were being used to divert water from the river to create flooding and displace the population in Anbar province while also denying water to other populations downstream,\" he said.\n\n\"The destruction of ISIL's equipment means, in this case, that they will not be able to use the river against the population in Anbar province.\"\n\nThe ISIS fighters were also using the equipment to develop defensive positions​.\n\nNo cost released\n\nVance wouldn't say how much the mission has cost so far, asserting it's up to the federal government to release those numbers.\n\nHow many bombs were dropped and whether any ISIL fighters were killed in Sunday's raid were also subjects Vance was not prepared to talk about, but he did say he was confident there were no civilian casualties.\n\nPrevious Next Canada has six CF-18 fighter jets, as well as two Aurora surveillance aircraft and a CC-150 Polaris operating out of air bases in Kuwait. The combat mission, which began with the first patrols last week, has been carried out under a blanket of secrecy with the Canadian military denying media access to the bases, citing security concerns of their Kuwaiti hosts. CP-140\n\nSunday's mission lasted approximately four hours, Nicholson's statement said, and included an air-to-air refuelling of the fighter jets by a CC-150 Polaris aircraft. All aircraft made it safely back to base.\n\nThe fight against ISIS, Vance said, \"will be led by the Iraqis themselves and that is why we are actively supporting them.\"\n\nHe didn't speculate on how long the fight will take, but a top American commander — U.S. Gen. Ray Odierno — recently told CNN he sees it taking up to four years.\n\n\"It's absolutely clear Iraqi forces want to begin their offensive operations as soon as they can,\" said Vance, who added that he \"honestly doesn't have a good answer as to how long [the overall campaign] will take.\"\n\nDetailed planning is still underway among allies, who are considering a mission to train not only thousands of regular Iraqi army troops, but also local police officers and Iraq's version of a national guard.\n\nA training mission could take between six months and a year, Vance noted.\n\nThe Harper government has yet to say whether it would consider taking part in such a training mission beyond the advise-and-assist role being played by a few dozen Canadian special forces troops in northern Iraq.\n\nThus far, Canada has not been asked by allies to consider joining bombing ISIL targets in Syria."}
{"text": "Many observers were shocked and saddened when Brandon Coats, a quadriplegic who is authorized to use medical marijuana under Colorado state law, was fired from his job with Dish Network in 2010 after a positive drug test. Dish failed to make an exception for Coats, who used marijuana while off duty to control his seizures, and the company insisted on his being fired, leaving Coats no choice but to challenge this issue in court.\n\nSpecifically, Coats claimed that his conduct should have been permitted under the state's Lawful Off-Duty Activities Statute, which makes it an unfair and discriminatory labor practice to discharge an employee based on the employee's \"lawful,\" away-from-work activities. But the trial court, followed by the Court of Appeals and now the Colorado Supreme Court, have all ruled that the statute only protects conduct that is legal under both state and federal law — and therefore offers no job protection to Coats.\n\n\"Therefore, employees who engage in an activity, such as medical marijuana use, that is permitted by state law but unlawful under federal law are not protected by the statute,\" Justice Allison H. Eid wrote in the opinion.\n\nThis case highlights one of the most pressing issues that needs to be addressed in the states that have legalized medical cannabis use — and the states that have adopted full legalization for all adults, as well. Although employees are protected from arrest and prosecution under state law by these various laws, they remain vulnerable to employment discrimination in almost all states.\n\nSimply put, if an employer wants to insist on what they frequently call a \"drug-free workplace,\" they are legally permitted to do that — regardless of the unfairness this policy may cause, because we must note that they do not apply those same standards to off-job alcohol consumption or the use of prescription drugs.\n\nMost Americans would strongly support the right of an employer to fire anyone who comes to work in an impaired condition. But smoking marijuana leaves one mildly impaired only for about an hour and a half; Certainly smoking marijuana in the evening, or on the weekend, would have no impact on the employee who comes to work the following day.\n\nWhat we really need is for employers in these legalized states to become responsible corporate citizens and to do the right thing: Stop penalizing employees, absent a showing of impairment on the job. But absent that voluntary shift in policy, the obligation is now on those of us who favor marijuana legalization to go back to the state legislatures in states that have legalized cannabis, either for medical use or for all adults, and enact appropriate job protections for those who use marijuana legally under state law.\n\nBefore being allowed to fire an employee who tests positive for THC, the employer must be required to demonstrate on-the-job impairment. Just as we do not permit someone to be fired for reason of their gender, religion or race, neither should we permit an employee to be fired simply because they elect to use marijuana legally under state law, without a showing of actual on-job impairment.\n\nOtherwise we are requiring many medical-use patients to choose between relieving their pain and suffering and keeping their employment. And we are allowing employers to fire good, hard-working, loyal employees for off-the-job activities that are totally unrelated to their job performance.\n\nAnd that is simply unfair, and it cannot be allowed to stand. So let's get to work and fix this problem.\n\nKeith Stroup is an attorney, author of \"It's NORML to Smoke Pot: The 40-year Fight for Marijuana Smokers' Rights\" and founder of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, where he serves as legal counsel."}

That being said, I did not have high expectations for it. How wrong I was.\n\n\nPiddy's story broke my heart. On her first day at her new school, an unknown girl approaches Piddy and warns her that Yaqui wants to beat her up. From this moment, starts a daily terror for Piddy. She does not know who Yaqui is or why she would want to beat her up. All she is told is that Yaqui does not like the way Piddy \"shakes it\" when she walks. There's also an implication that Yaqui thinks Piddy is trying to steal Yaqui's boyfriend. None of this is substantiated, yet Yaqui turns this into very real thing for Piddy who starts to become unsure of herself. What is she doing wrong? How can she change her walk? How can someone who doesn't even know her hate her so much? How can she plan ways to avoid Yaqui and her crew? The reader never gets much insight into Yaqui or crew but they are so very real, the fear is real, and probably even more so because the terror just builds and builds. When is the monster going to pop out of the bushes and beat Piddy up?\n\n\nI really felt so bad for Piddy. There's bullies who inflict physical damage and there's bullies who inflict internal damage. Yaqui does beat up Piddy, but for me the real terror was that constant fear of not knowing what the day would bring. Would she run into Yaqui? Would today be the day Yaqui beats her up? It all is more compounded by the fact that Piddy can't reach out to anyone. She doesn't want to tell her mom, or her mom's best friend Lila. Her best friend from her old school seems to have no time for Piddy anymore. The one friend she has in school only serves to make Piddy feel worse with each new delivery of a message from Yaqui. Poor Piddy is all alone with this overwhelming problem. The problem becomes so huge that Piddy starts to suffer in school. She becomes angry at her mom, saying hurtful things to her.\n\n\nThe book won the Pura Belpre award and deservedly so. We have got to teach our children not to be bullies or haters (which is just one step down from being a bully in my opinion). And we have got to teach our kids to not glorify someone getting attacked. When Piddy does get beat up, it gets filmed on someone's phone and posted on the internet for all to see. Writing this review I can still feel the anger in me. No one should have to go to school and feel ostracized or hated.\n\n\nMy bows to the author for handling this topic in such a realistic way and for capturing what it feels like to be bullied without going over the top."}
{"text": "CyanogenMod is the most popular flavor of Android and the company Cyanogen Inc. was formed to commercialize it. According to Cyanogen, its OS has been installed over 12 million times till now.\n\nAlthough Cyanogen developers have benefitted much from Android, Cyanogen is not happy with Google's control over Android and its licensing terms. The company's CEO Kirt McMaster recently said, \"We're attempting to take Android away from Google\" and what's more, Cyanogen has raised enough funds to make it possible.\n\nIn a span of only 18 months, Cyanogen Inc. has received more than $110 million in funds. It has collected as much as $80 million in the last round of funding received from big companies such as Twitter Ventures, Telefonica Ventures, Qualcomm, Rupert Murdoch and others. The funds will be utilized to develop another open source operating system platform that will be even better then Android.\n\nCyanogen hopes to build a mobile OS platform that is independent of Google and the investors feel that CyanogenMod has a good chance of becoming the 3rd biggest platform after Android and iOS.\n\nAll Google's services like Gmail, GooglePlay Google Calender etc. are integrated in Android which is currently the world's most popular operating system especially in the western world. However in the eastern regions such as Mainland China, Google services aren't used much because Google has left China due to issues with the government. So, Chinese devices mostly run Android versions based on Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and offer non-Google services. Xiaomi's MIUI is one such OS. Cyanogen wants to target this market and expand its spread. Of course, Google is also trying to make inroads into China with its Google Play but it is difficult due to other companies such as Tencent, Baidu and Qihoo already in the field.\n\nAnother reason why OEMs and mobile carriers are so much interested in promoting Cyanogen is control. When Android was new, Google allowed OEMs and mobile carriers to make changes to the mobile OS as they wanted, but slowly over time, this has led to fragmentation, making it difficult for Google to push OS updates across so many different kinds of devices. Firstly, OEMs and carriers have to agree for the updates and secondly, customizations made by other companies such as Samsung and HTC have also to be added to them. What's more, Google has also pulled out more and more parts out of the AOSP into its own domain.\n\n\"App and chip vendors are very worried about Google controlling the entire experience,\" Peter Levine, partner at Andreessen Horowitz, a Cyanogen investor, told Forbes. Particularly, the firms that are competing with Google or Apple welcome Cyanogen as a third option to avoid monopoly by these two giants.\n\nAlso, Google's vision about Android may not always be acceptable to its other partners and using a non-Google version of Android allows the manufacturers to use their own versions of UI skins, security patches and bundling of app stores and services. But as customizing the OS by themselves is not possible and affordable for all device makers, they are looking for something like Cyanogen to help them out. Cyanogen has ample Android experience and can customize the OS to run on different kinds of devices.\n\nMicromax, an Indian company, has signed a deal with Cyanogen for pre-installing Cyanogen OS on its premium high-end devices including its new Yureka smartphone. Other companies are expected to join in. Now with new funds, the company can invest in hiring experts to speed up the development process and soon provide a third alternative to Google's Android and Apple's iOS."}

{"text": "Hunting is a major threat to wildlife particularly in tropical regions, but a systematic large-scale estimate of hunting-induced declines of animal numbers was lacking so far. A study published in Science on April 14 fills this gap. An international team of ecologists and environmental scientists found that bird and mammal populations were reduced within 7 and 40 km of hunters' access points, such as roads and settlements.\n\nWithin these impact zones, mammal populations declined on average by 83% and bird populations by 58%. Additionally, the team found that commercial hunting had a higher impact than hunting for family food, and that hunting pressure was higher in areas with better accessibility to major towns where wild meat could be traded. The impact of hunting was found to be larger than the team expected. 'Thanks to this study, we estimate that only 17 percent of the original mammal abundance and 42 percent of the birds remain in hunted areas.'\n\nThe researchers synthesised 176 studies to quantify hunting-induced declines of mammal and bird populations across the tropics of Central and South America, Africa and Asia. The study was led by Ana Benítez-López, who works at the department of Environmental Science at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. She cooperated with researchers from the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL), the universities of Wageningen and Utrecht in the Netherlands and a colleague from the School of Life Sciences, University of Sussex.\n\nHigher hunting pressure around villages and roads\n\n'There are several drivers of animal decline in tropical landscapes: habitat destruction, overhunting, fragmentation etcetera. While deforestation and habitat loss can be monitored using remote sensing, hunting can only be tracked on the ground. We wanted to find a systematic and consistent way to estimate the impact of hunting across the tropics. As a starting point, we used the hypothesis that humans gather resources in a circle around their village and in the proximity of roads. As such, hunting pressure is higher in the proximity of villages and other access points. From there the densities of species increase up to a distance where no effect of hunting is observed. We called this species depletion distances which we quantified in our analysis. This allowed us to map hunting-induced declines across the tropics for the first time,' Benítez-López explains.\n\nNot only the big cuddly species\n\nThe main novelty of the current study is that it combined the evidence across many local studies, thus for the first time providing an overarching picture of the magnitude of the impact across a large number of species. The study takes all animals into account -- not only the big cuddly species, but birds and rodents as well. Benítez-López explains the difference in impact between birds and mammals: 'Mammals are more sought after because they're bigger and provide more food. They are worth a longer trip. The bigger the mammal, the further a hunter would walk to catch it.' With increasing wild meat demand for rural and urban supply, hunters have harvested the larger species almost to extinction in the proximity of the villages and they must travel further distances to hunt. Besides, for commercially interesting species such as elephants and gorillas, hunting distances are much larger because the returns are higher.\n\nProtected areas are no safe haven\n\nAnother interesting finding of this study is that mammal populations have also been reduced by hunting even within protected areas. 'Strategies to sustainably manage wild meat hunting in both protected and unprotected tropical ecosystems are urgently needed to avoid further defaunation,' she says. 'This includes monitoring hunting activities by increasing anti-poaching patrols and controlling overexploitation via law enforcement'."}

{"text": "Last May, the U.S. Supreme Court issued what was perhaps the most significant death penalty ruling in a decade when it rejected Florida's standard for putting to death defendants who may be intellectually disabled. The U.S. Supreme Court has said that capital punishment for the intellectually disabled is unconstitutional. But Florida was one of several states that was arguably doing it anyway, by making the standard for proving disability so onerous that almost no one could meet it.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court only struck down Florida's law, the ruling paved the way to challenge other state provisions that make it near-impossible to prove that a state is about to illegally put an intellectually disabled man to death, such as those in Georgia and Texas. But this week, a county judge rejected a legal challenge in Georgia, finding that death row inmate Warren Hill has \"not cited any new law or evidence sufficient to overcome the procedural bar.\"\n\nSeven different mental health experts who have evaluated Hill all now agree that he has an intellectual disability (previously referred to by the courts as \"mentally retarded.\"). Hill also has an IQ score of 70. But all of that wasn't enough to meet Georgia's near-impossible standard of proving mental disability beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, Warren Hill remains on death row.\n\nIn its Supreme Court decision last may, Justice Anthony Kennedy invalidated a Florida standard that allowed one IQ score for death row inmate Freddie Lee Hall to be the sole determinant of whether he had an intellectual disability and would be sent to death. \"This rigid rule, the Court now holds, creates an unacceptable risk that persons with intellectual disability will be executed, and thus is unconstitutional,\" Kennedy wrote for a five-justice majority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKennedy's ruling did not address the ways that other states like Georgia have created an equally high risk that individuals with an intellectual disability will be executed. But Kennedy did reaffirm the constitutional commitment to protecting vulnerable populations like the intellectual disabled. In 2002, the Supreme Court ruled that \"death is not a suitable punishment for a mentally retarded criminal,\" reasoning that their disability \"places them at special risk of wrongful execution.\" Executing an intellectually disabled inmate also does not serve the typical goals of punishment. It is inherently not rehabilitative. And it is particularly unlikely to deter crimes or serve as a meaningful punishment to those criminals who are incapable of understanding the nature of their acts.\n\nKennedy wrote that \"Florida's law contravenes our Nation's commitment to dignity and its duty to teach human decency as the mark of a civilized world. The States are laboratories for experimentation, but those experiments may not deny the basic dignity the Constitu­tion protects.\"\n\nDespite this brand new Supreme Court precedent, Butts County Superior Court Judge Thomas H. Wilson concluded that, \"This Court is of the opinion that the Hall [v. Florida] case is not sufficiently on point to justify a Habeas decision overturning the current Georgia law.\"\n\nHill's motion to have his death sentence reconsidered was thus dismissed by Wilson, but not before Wilson encouraged the Georgia Supreme Court to review the case. \"In light of the severity of the penalty in this case, this Court hopes that, in reviewing Petitioner's application to appeal, the court will fully consider any application of Hall v. Florida to Petitioner's case.\" He notes that Warren's case would \"in its factual concept be a perfect and definitive decision in this area of law.\"\n\nIn its ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court only addressed Florida's standard, which allowed a court to rule on a defendant's disability based on one administration of an IQ test, even when other factors and even other IQ tests suggested intellectual disability."}

Four U.S. soldiers were among them.\n\nThe United States believes that the structure of the more than three-decade old operation may be outdated.\n\n\"I don't think anyone's talking about a (complete) withdrawal,\" said Navy Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, declining to discuss specifics about any potential troop reduction.\n\n\"I think we're just going to look at the number of people we have there and see if there are functions that can be automated or done through remote monitoring.\"\n\nChanging the MFO mission could be a sensitive proposition to both Israel and Egypt.\n\nCairo sees the MFO as part of a relationship with Israel that, while unpopular with many Egyptians, brings it $1.3 billion in annual U.S. defense aid, sweetening the foreign-enforced demilitarization of their sovereign Sinai territory.\n\nFor the Israelis, the MFO offers strategic reassurance, especially following Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's toppling two years ago of an elected Islamist regime hostile to the Jewish-majority state next door.\n\nThe White House stressed that the United States was not questioning its support for the mission.\n\n\"The U.S. commitment to this treaty and this mission has never been stronger, and that's evidenced by the fact that the United States government is prepared to deploy new equipment and new technology,\" White House Spokesman Josh Earnest said.\n\nAn Egyptian border post is seen from the Israeli side of the border fence with Egypt's Sinai peninsula, in Israel's Negev Desert February 10, 2016. REUTERS/Amir Cohen\n\nAmong the options being considered are use of remote sensors or surveillance to do some of the work in the peninsula that lies between Israel, the Gaza Strip and the Suez Canal.\n\n\"What we are looking at is, this has been in existence for 30 years and the mission has remained largely unchanged,\" Davis said.\n\n\"What we want to be able to do is look at the core things that that mission provides and see how we can leverage modern technologies, remote surveillance capabilities, etc., to be able to carry out that mission.\"\n\nEgyptian security efforts in the Sinai have suffered major setbacks, including the Oct. 31 downing of a Russian airliner and Friday's bombing of two armored personnel carriers that killed seven.\n\nIslamic State insurgents claimed responsibility for both incidents.\n\nAn Egyptian diplomat, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said over the past month the MFO had already shut down two outposts near Egyptian Rafah.\n\nThe area has not been especially hard hit by the Sinai insurgency, the diplomat said, but added that the MFO \"considered them too difficult to maintain in terms of logistics.\""}
{"text": "Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal (D) was alternately apologetic and defiant Tuesday as he battled to deflect a potentially devastating blow to his Senate campaign: an accusation that he had exaggerated his military service record.\n\nBlumenthal, his party's presumptive nominee in the contest to succeed retiring Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D), held a news conference in West Hartford to respond to the New York Times report Monday night that he has lied about serving in Vietnam.\n\n\"On a few occasions I have misspoken about my service, and I regret that and I take full responsibility,\" Blumenthal said, flanked by veterans. \"But I will not allow anyone to take a few misplaced words and impugn my record of service to our country.\"\n\nBlumenthal joined the Marine Corps Reserves in 1970 and served six years, all in the United States. He has accurately described his service many times in his career, but in 2008, he told an audience at an event in Norwalk: \"We have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam. And you exemplify it. Whatever we think about the war, whatever we call it -- Afghanistan or Iraq -- we owe our military men and women unconditional support.\"\n\nBlumenthal explained Tuesday that he meant to say he served \"during\" Vietnam, not \"in\" Vietnam. And he stressed that \"there were no special favors, no privileges involved\" in his securing a slot in the Marine Reserves.\n\nThe Times article about Blumenthal's military record noted that he received five draft deferments before his enlistment, including one during which he served as an assistant to then-Washington Post Publisher Katharine Graham.\n\nThe controversy could place Connecticut's contest among the most competitive Senate races in November. Blumenthal had been heavily favored to win since January, when he plunged into the race after Dodd announced that he would end his foundering reelection bid. Former World Wrestling Entertainment executive Linda McMahon and former U.S. representative Rob Simmons are competing for the Republican nomination.\n\nStuart Rothenberg, author of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report, said Blumenthal's revelation instantly made the race \"significantly more competitive.\"\n\n\"He's got a terrible credibility problem here, and I think what makes it so dramatic is this is a guy who had such a squeaky-clean reputation,\" Rothenberg said.\n\nBoth Republican candidates pounced on the opportunity to attack Blumenthal.\n\n\"The report clearly raises some very serious questions -- questions that cannot be dismissed and aren't easily answered,\" said McMahon spokesman Ed Patru.\n\nThere was no sign Tuesday that any national Democrats were abandoning Blumenthal, and Democrats' initial defense was to attempt to turn the story around on McMahon by accusing her of peddling negative information.\n\nSimmons, meanwhile, is in a position to attack Blumenthal from a different angle: He is a decorated Vietnam veteran.\n\n\"As someone who served, I respect Richard Blumenthal for wearing the uniform, but I am deeply troubled by allegations that he has misrepresented his service,\" Simmons said in a statement Monday.\n\nAn independent poll of the GOP contest taken in March showed McMahon with a 10-point lead over Simmons. Aided by her vast personal wealth, McMahon has also been able to outspend Simmons.\n\nDemocrats breathed a sigh of relief when Dodd announced that he would retire after 30 years in the Senate; polls had shown him trailing both Republican candidates. Blumenthal stepped in with high approval ratings, bolstered over his two decades as attorney general by his high-profile crusades against corporate interests. But he has not run in a competitive race for many years and so has avoided the scrutiny such campaigns can bring."}
{"text": "A woman in California is suing a beauty salon after she says she developed a stroke from having her hair washed in one of the salon's sinks. Elizabeth Smith, 48, tells San Diego's KGTV that eight days after visiting her local salon, where she had her hair washed for 10 minutes, she felt weakness in her left arm and leg. A week later, she had a massive stroke. \"They didn't think I was going to live,\" she recalled.\n\nThe stroke left Smith with strength, balance, and vision issues, as well as a brain clot that could kill her if it moves. Smith is now suing the salon, saying they didn't adequately support her neck during the treatment, leading to her stroke.\n\nWhile it sounds far-fetched, experts say this is a legitimate condition known as beauty parlor stroke syndrome.\n\n\"This is a potential problem that we've seen as the cause of strokes, usually in younger people ,\" says Peter Gloviczki, M.D., a vascular surgeon at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. beauty parlor stroke syndrome is caused when there is an injury, tear, or blood clot in one of the four major arteries that go to the brain, he explains.\n\nThe main problem is hyperextension of the neck, which can occur when you're having your hair shampooed, and staying in that position for a period of time. \"When you hyperextend your neck, there can be a little bit of compression on the artery from simply just changing the position or the bones slide a little bit one over the other,\" Gloviczki says. That can cause a tear in the blood vessel, resulting in a blood clot, which can travel to your brain and cause a stroke.\n\nAneesh Singhal, M.D., associate professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and vice chair of Neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital, says this kind of thing can also happen to people when they're at the dentist, playing tennis, undergoing chiropractic neck manipulation, and even doing yoga.\n\nWhile this can really happen to anyone, it's not extremely common, and Gloviczki says it's often found more in people who have some kind of connective tissue disease or underlying weakness, which, unfortunately, they might not be aware of.\n\nSinghal says you can minimize your risk without swearing off salon shampooing forever. \"Avoid activities where the neck would be malpositioned for a long period of time—more than 10 or 15 minutes, but it could be even less,\" he says\n\nClifford Segil, D.O., a neurologist at California's Providence Saint John's Health Center also recommends making sure your neck is supported when you have your hair washed and asking a salon employee to pad the area where your neck will be positioned over the wash basin with a towel.\n\nThe initial warning signs of beauty parlor stroke syndrome are a little different from those of a typical stroke , Segil says. They include dizziness and unsteadiness in your hands, but can also include migraine-type headaches, some loss of vision or blurred vision, neck swelling, and change of taste. (After that, the symptoms match those of a regular stroke , including: numbness, especially on one side of the body, loss of balance, slurred speech, and—in women, specifically—weakness, fainting, and sudden behavioral change.)\n\nWhile beauty parlor stroke syndrome sounds terrifying, experts note that it's pretty rare. \"You don't need to avoid going to the beauty parlor, just be aware that there's a small risk,\" says Singhal."}

{"text": "A former assistant attorney general who refused to apologize to a gay student leader at the University of Michigan whom he defamed and harassed online and on campus must now pay him $4.5 million, a jury decided.\n\nThe \"Chris Armstrong Watch\" blog, created by former Michigan Assistant Attorney General Andrew Shirvell, 32, accused openly gay University of Michigan ex-student body president Christopher Armstrong of enticing minors with alcohol and recruiting people to become homosexual.\n\nThe U.S. District Court jury Thursday awarded a $4.5 million civil settlement to Armstrong, 22, who said he suffered distress as a result of Shirvell's actions.\n\n\"I'm just incredibly humbled by what happened today,\" Armstrong said Thursday. \"This is truly a victory, not just for myself, but for a lot of other kids out there.\"\n\nMichigan alum Shirvell blogged that Armstrong, who graduated in 2011, was \"a radical homosexual activist, racist, elitist and liar.\"\n\nDeborah Gordon, the attorney representing Armstrong, said Shirvell also blogged that Armstrong participated in a number of sordid activities, including engaging in sex acts on a children's playground, inside a church and that he hosted orgies.\n\nShirvell would find out via Facebook about events Armstrong planned to attend in Ann Arbor, Mich., turn up and try to blend in with the crowd, Gordon said. He showed up at Armstrong's house several times and at one point called the police to report a party Armstrong was attending; he then blogged that \"Ann Arbor police raided out of control gay party,\" she said.\n\nGordon told ABC News that she did not present the jury with anything on the blog that could be considered opinion, but showed the court that what Shirvell said was provable as false. She said Shirvell did not call a single witness during the trial, but \"wrapped himself in the First Amendment.\"\n\nShirvell contested in court that all his statements were either true, or protected because of Armstrong's role as a public figure. He said that he plans to appeal, according to The Associated Press.\n\n\"This should have been thrown out,\" he said Thursday. \"Juries give short shrift to First Amendment rights.\"\n\nGordon said Shirvell was told that the lawsuit would have been dropped if he had retracted his statements. She said that because the jury that heard the case is unable to make Shirvell issue an apology, the $4.5 million in damages would take its place.\n\n\"When we filed the case, we sent him a letter asking for retractions,\" Gordon said. \"We sent a letter before the case was heard. The record needed to be set straight.\"\n\nShirvell, who was fired by former Attorney General Mike Cox after criticism of Armstrong in 2010, said he is unemployed, and that he has no means to pay such a sizable settlement, The AP reported.\n\n\"There's no way I could possibly ever pay such a judgment,\" he said after the ruling.\n\nShirvell, who represented himself, did not return calls from ABC News today.\n\nGordon said Armstrong has a job that resulted from an internship he had last year. She says she will continue to represent him, but that the possibility of allowing a retraction to settle the situation has passed.\n\n\"The jury has spoken. He had his chance to take responsibility and make this right, and give Chris his reputation back,\" she said.\n\n\"The jury did it. I don't need any retractions, nor am I asking. Absolutely not. He can just live with that.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Friday the United States is renegotiating its trade deal with South Korea as he met the nation's new leader for talks also addressing the nuclear weapons threat from North Korea.\n\nTrump welcomed South Korean President Moon Jae-in for formal talks at the White House a day after they met over dinner. As well as concerns over North Korea's technological progress toward a nuclear-tipped missile that could strike the continental U.S., Trump is pushing for a narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea.\n\nSince his 2016 election campaign, Trump has been critical of a 2012 bilateral free trade agreement and barriers to U.S. auto exports. South Korea had trade surplus of $17 billion with the U.S. last year when including both goods and services.\n\n\"We are renegotiating a trade deal right now as we speak with South Korea and hopefully it will be an equitable deal, it will be a fair deal for both parties,\" Trump said alongside Moon in the Oval Office. \"\"We want something that will be very good for the American worker.\"\n\nAhead of Moon's visit, the White House official said Trump would call for the lifting of barriers to U.S. auto sales in South Korea and voice concern over steel exports from China that reach the U.S. via South Korea. South Korean companies on Thursday announced plans to import more American shale gas and build new factories in the U.S. that Seoul hoped could help fend off the criticism.\n\nMoon said he and Trump had \"honest discussions\" at dinner on the North Korean nuclear issue and other issues of mutual interest.\n\n\"It was a great opportunity for us to further the trust and friendship between me and President Trump,\" Moon said. \"It was also an opportunity for us to reconfirm the fact that the United States and Korea are walking together on the same path towards a great alliance.\"\n\nAfter expanded talks involving other officials, the two leaders will make statements to reporters.\n\nOn North Korea, Trump said, \"we have a very, very strong and solid plan.\" On Thursday, the Treasury Department blacklisted a Chinese bank accused of conducting millions in illicit business with North Korea as Washington intensified pressure on Beijing to crackdown on its wayward ally.\n\nThe South Korean leader has sought to make clear to the U.S. that he is also serious about dealing with his neighbor's threat, despite his inclination to restart dialogue with the North.\n\nMoon's conservative predecessor, who was impeached in a bribery scandal, took a hard line toward North Korea. In recent interviews, Moon has said sanctions alone cannot solve the problem of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, but the \"right conditions\" are needed for dialogue.\n\nIn another point of contention, Moon has delayed the full deployment of a U.S. missile defense system, which is intended to defend South Koreans and the 28,000 U.S. troops based in the country, pending an environmental review.\n\nBefore Friday's talks at the White House, Moon laid a wreath at the Korean War Memorial monument near the Washington Mall. He was accompanied by Vice President Mike Pence, whose father served in the U.S. Army during the 1950-53 Korean War. Under the pale blue morning sky, they observed a moment of silence as a lone trumpeter played \"Taps.\"\n\nIt was the second occasion during Moon's four-day visit that he has paid tribute to American veterans of that conflict. On Wednesday, he visited a memorial to Marines who fought in rearguard U.S. action in 1950 that enabled a mass evacuation of Korean civilians, including Moon's parents."}

{"text": "A number of teams have a chance to make one final statement and pad their résumés during conference championship weekend.\n\nWhat will each team's résumé look like with a win or loss on Saturday?\n\nWith the help of ESPN's strength of record metric (SOR), we can project how each team's overall body of work will stack up. Strength of record measures the chance an average top-25 team would have a team's record or better, given its schedule. We often display strength of record as a rank, but behind those rankings are calculations that give an actual probability. For example, an average top-25 team would have a 3 percent chance of starting 11-1 or better against Ohio State's schedule.\n\nAfter defeating Colorado on Friday night, Washington moved up to No. 4 in strength of record.\n\nESPN Analytics\n\nBut what will the rankings look like after Saturday's games? We can project strength of record based on if a team wins or loses. It's important to note these may change overnight depending on the actual results of the games. Nonetheless, below you will find the percentage chance for an average top-25 team to achieve each team's record or better based on various outcomes Saturday:\n\nChance of achieving team's W-L from perspective of average top-25 team Teams in contention for CFP Current With Win With Loss Alabama (12-0) <1% <1% 2% Ohio State (11-1) 3% -- -- Clemson (11-1) 7% 5% 19% Washington (12-1) 11% -- -- Wisconsin (10-2) 16% 10% 29% Colorado (10-3) 27% -- -- Penn State (10-2) 28% 16% 42% Michigan (10-2) 30% -- -- Oklahoma (9-2) 32% 23% 49% Oklahoma State (9-2) 57% 34%* 63% *11% if OSU had defeated Central Michigan\n\n-- Alabama will likely end the season with the strongest strength of record, no matter the result of the SEC championship game.\n\n-- Will Washington hang onto the fourth spot in SOR? If Wisconsin beats Penn State it will be a tight race between the Badgers and Huskies for No. 4. However, if Penn State wins, Washington appears to have the clear edge to remain in the top four.\n\n-- If Clemson loses, the Tigers would likely drop out of the top four in SOR and open the door for a Big Ten team.\n\n-- Michigan will remain outside the top five in SOR without another chance for a quality win. The Wolverines are the greatest example of best vs. most deserving, though, with a top-three ranking in ESPN's Football Power Index and nearly every other power ranking.\n\n-- Finally, the Big 12's outlook looks bleak, but one interesting number from above is Oklahoma State's strength of record assuming a win Saturday, and assuming they had defeated Central Michigan. The Cowboys would be right in the mix for the fourth-best SOR.\n\nThere are obviously more factors that contribute to a team's seeding and inclusion in the playoff than simply its résumé (eye test, team strength, etc.), but strength of record, though not designed to predict the playoff, has correlated closely with the committee's rankings the past two seasons. Seven of the eight teams to make the playoff the past two seasons ranked in the top four in strength of record.\n\nIf the favorites win Saturday the rankings may not change too much, but if mayhem ensues, keep an eye on these projections to see how each team's résumé will stack up."}
{"text": "Friday night on Fox News' The First 100 Days, host Martha MacCallum interviewed the attorneys defending one of the illegal immigrants accused of raping a 14-year-old girl at Rockville High School, just over a week ago. The two lawyers defending 17-year-old Jose Montano blasted what they called the \"sensationalized\" coverage of the story, (despite the media blackout of its coverage). The primary defense attorney even blamed Trump's immigration policies for spurring undue outrage at the story.\n\nThe segment began with correspondent Doug McKelway introducing Montano's \"high profile\" and \"respected\" lawyer, David Wooten, who had been hired privately by his family. The Fox News reporter noted Wooten had just won a case where his client was accused of sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl. Wooten defended Montano as innocent, claiming that the truth wasn't black and white:\n\nWOOTEN: There's your version, there's my version and then there's the truth. In my experience as a criminal defense attorney, that is almost always the truth. The truth is somewhere in between.\n\nAnchor MacCallum then began her interview with attorney David Wooten and Maria Mena, who runs the law agency where Wooten works, by asking Wooten what basis he had for claiming his client's innocence. He responded by attacking Donald Trump and the media for sensationalizing the case and unfairly attacking his client.\n\nWooten blasted the \"out of control\" \"sensationalism,\" \"outrage,\" and \"hysteria\" that's been happening over the rape. He continued:\n\n\"The reason for that, I believe, that is because of the disgusting vitriol that's been spewed by Donald Trump ever since the beginning of his campaign,\" Wooten ranted, before being interrupted by MacCallum.\n\n\"I have no idea what Donald Trump has to do with this,\" she said quickly. Getting back to the point, MacCallum asked again directly what reason the attorneys had for believing their clients were innocent, despite statements from local authorities confirming this was violent, forcible assault.\n\nWooten shifted back to immigration again, complaining that the two men's immigration status was irrelevant to the case. MacCallum responded that it was a \"fact\" that they were here illegally so it was a \"part of the case\" that you couldn't ignore.\n\nMena then complained to MacCallum that her defendant and the school board were getting anti-immigrant \"death threats\" because of the media attention. She proceeded to try to blame the outrage as partisan, motivated by Trump's immigration policies:\n\n\"This is highlighted because of immigration,\" Mena pressed. \"That's why this case has received such national attention,\" she added.\n\nMacCallum pushed back that the outrage was natural, for several reasons, not the least of which had to do with the pair's status as illegal aliens.\n\nMACCALLUM: People are very upset about the fact that you know, people are detained by ICE then they are released, they're upset about the fact that 17 and 18-year-olds are in classes with 9th graders, that is why this case has garnered so much attention. Because a law was already broken by these young men, who entered the country illegally.\n\nIgnoring most of what she said, Wooten answered again that his point was that this was \"all about immigration.\" \"We wouldn't even be on this show right now if it wasn't for the fact that this has become a conversation about immigration,\" he added."}
{"text": "889 Solandra maxima\n\nCommon Names: chalice vine, cup of gold, goldcup vine, golden chalice vine\n\nFamily: Solanaceae (nightshade Family)\n\nChalice vine flowers start our yellow and turn to gold as they get old.\n\nDescription\n\nCup of gold, sometimes called chalice vine, is a heavy, thick stemmed tropical liana with large shiny leaves and large bell shaped golden yellow flowers. The thick and woody ropelike stems branch frequently and root at their nodes, and can run for more than 200 ft (61 m), clinging with aerial rootlets and scrambling over everything in the way. The evergreen leaves are leathery, about 6 in (15.2 cm) long and elliptic, with prominent lighter colored midribs and lateral veins. The flowers are truly spectacular, shaped like a chalice, 6-10 in (15.2-25.4 cm) long, flaring open to 4-7 in (10.2-17.8 cm) across. The five lobes of the corolla are reflexed, and each lobe is marked with a narrow purplish brown ridge on the inside. The flowers start out yellow and turn deeper golden as they age. They are fragrant, especially at night, with a scent reminiscent of coconut. Cup of gold blooms intermittently through the year, but mainly in the winter dry season. The fruits, rarely seen in cultivation, are round berries, about 2 in (5.1 cm) in diameter.\n\nThere are eight species of chalice vines, and they often are confused in the trade. Solandra maxima is the most common species in cultivation and vines offered as S. guttata and S. grandiflora may in fact be this one. The differences are subtle.\n\nLocation\n\nSolandra maxima is native to Mexico, Central America and northern South America. Other species occur in the West Indies.\n\nCulture\n\nCup of gold is a fast growing vine that thrives in most any well-drained soil. It tolerates severe pruning and blooms on new growth, so it can be cut back at any time of year. This is a heavy vine, and it requires a very sturdy support. Light: Cup of gold thrives in full sun to partial shade. Moisture: Cup of gold grows best with regular watering, but blooms best when water is withheld. Let the vine grow for a while, producing vigorous new shoots, then withhold water until the leaves begin to wilt. Hardiness: USDA Zones 10 - 11 . Propagation: Cup of gold usually is propagated from stem cuttings taken in summer and rooted with bottom heat.\n\nA cup of gold vine once grew on this pergola at the Fairchild Tropical Garden in Miami, Florida.\n\nUsage\n\nCup of gold is often grown on large pergolas or trellises, or trained to grow up the side of a house where the spectacular flowers can spill down the walls over windows and doorways. Tolerant of salt spray and salty soils, all the chalice vines are excellent for seaside gardens. This is a large, rampant grower which requires plenty of space and a strong support.\n\nFeatures\n\nThe chalice vines are related to the angel trumpets (Datura spp. and Brugmansia spp.), and like them, have hallucinogenic properties. They are used in sacred ceremonies in Mexico.\n\nWarning\n\nThe flowers, and probably all parts, of chalice vines are poisonous."}

{"text": "The wheels touched down and Wray awoke with a jerk. Where was he? Cleveland? Pittsburgh? Buffalo? Did it matter? Bobbie had booked him on a 6 week \"tour of the Rust Belt\". 6 weeks, 6 cons with comic store appearances in between. 5 weeks in and he was starting to feel more frayed than ususal and the plane was the first real sleep he'd gotten in all that time. 2 more cons and he could go home.\n\n\"Welcome to sunny Pittsburgh\" , droned the pilot as the late February rain started. It was gonna be a long ride to the convention center. Why did his crotch feel so cold? It was then Wray realized that the passenger next to him had also fallen asleep and in the process had spilt coffee down Wray's pants. How did he sleep through that?! Welcome to sunny Pittsburgh.\n\nAt least getting the rental car and the drive to the convention center had been uneventful. He had to admit it stung a bit that the banners hung for the Con annouced guests like Patrick Stewart, Chris Evans, and Oscar Issac with bold colors and fonts and his own name as reduced to a \"also featuring\". At this point he just wanted to get into his room, change his stained pants, and take a nap before all the craziness began.\n\nWray had just managed to get into the hotel room and set his things down when the door flew open. In the door way stood a voice actor cum con lothario and the one of Wray's closest friends on the con circut.\n\n\"Ha! Wray peed his pants!\", boomed Jerry Lansing. \"What's the matter did little Wray-Wray get all scared?\" Jarry half-tackled half-hugged Wray the way big bothers or golden retrievers do. Crashing both of them on the bed.\n\n\"Dammit, Jerry. Get off of me. I didn't pee my pants and IF I had peed my pants now it's all over you.\"\n\nJerry let up and held his hands to his nose. He took a deep breath in and considered the smell, \"Eh. I've done weirder. \"\n\n\"Get OFF!\" Wray shoved Jerry as hard as he could. The baritoned-voice actor took the hint and let Wray up.\n\n\"Aww. What's the matter, buddy?\"\n\n\"Nothing. It's this weather. The flight. \"\n\n\"…that you peed your pants.\"\n\n\"I DIDN'T PEE MY PANTS, JERRY!\"\n\n\"I know. Look, you were a sad sack back in Detroit. So I called in a favor with the 501st. We're gonna get your groove back!\"\n\n\"I'm not a middle-aged woman that needs to be romanced by Taye Diggs! I don't need my groove back. I have plenty of groove! I am groove-ful!\"\n\nJerry cocked his head and looked at Wray in a away that said, \"Can you hear yourself speak?\"\n\n\"OK, maybe I could use a little groove.\"\n\nA grin split Jerry's face. \"My MAN!\", Jerry near-shouted. Arms wide, he backed toward the closet, \"You and I are going\", with a florish he threw open the closet door revealing a pair of Storm Trooper costumes, \"incognito!\"\n\nWray sighed to himself, \" I have a really bad feeling about this.\" Then Wray realized something, \"How did you get those into my hotel room closet?\""}
{"text": "U.S. President Barak Obama publicly condemned the proposed SOPA legislation for the first time over the weekend, and Congress responded by dropping the bill, at least for now. SOPA, or the Stop Online Piracy Act, was presented as a tool to help stop online intellectual property theft, although opponents to the bill said it would give the government control over the content Internet users can view.\n\nIn response to online petitions against the SOPA legislation, the President said even though he sees online piracy from foreign websites as a problem, he won't support any bill that erodes freedom of speech or expression, or that potentially threatens online security.\n\n\"Any effort to combat online piracy must guard against the risk of online censorship of lawful activity and must not inhibit innovation by our dynamic businesses large and small,\" White House spokesman Macon Phillips said. He added, \"We will not support legislation that reduces freedom of expression, increases cybersecurity risk, or undermines the dynamic, innovative global Internet.\"\n\nThe President targeted key parts of the SOPA bill that would require domain hosts to block websites suspected of sharing content that's copyright protected based on little more than a complaint.\n\n\"Proposed laws must not tamper with the technical architecture of the Internet through manipulation of the Domain Name System (DNS), a foundation of Internet security,\" Mr. Phillips said. \"Our analysis of the DNS filtering provisions in some proposed legislation suggests that they pose a real risk to cybersecurity and yet leave contraband goods and services accessible online.\"\n\nBill supporters responded first by dropping language that required hosting companies to block websites suspected of copyright infringement, then later shelved the entire bill. A new version could, however, find its way back to the debate floor should law makers come to a consensus on wording that's more to the President's liking.\n\nSOPA would've made it surprisingly easy to get court orders to shut down any website suspected of participating — directly or indirectly — in copyright infringement. Internet service providers would've been required to block access to sites that host or link to other sites suspected of copyright infringement, and unauthorized streaming of copyright-protected content would be a felony offense.\n\nThe man that introduced the bill, Lamar Smith (R-TX), had hoped to push it through the House Judiciary Committee before the Christmas holiday. His efforts, however, stalled and lawmakers picked it back up again after the new year.\n\nWhile SOPA may be on the back burner for now, a similar bill called the Protect IP Act (PIPA) is still working its way through the Senate.\n\nIn response to both SOPA and PIPA, House Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa (R-CA) launched what he's calling the Keep The Web OPEN Project to underscore the importance of a free and open Internet and to offer up alternative legislation for protecting intellectual property while avoiding online censorship.\n\n\"The OPEN Act secures two fundamental principles. First, Americans have a right to benefit from what they've created. And second, Americans have a right to an open internet,\" the OPEN website states. \"Our duty is to protect these rights.\"\n\nThe President's stance on SOPA, along with Congress's decision to put the bill on hold for now, is good news for everyone that opposed the bill, but it isn't a complete victory. Politicians could still take SOPA's language and add it to other bills, or find new wording that brings the current bill back to life.\n\nFor now, the President is encouraging businesses and end users to work together on combating online piracy. \"We expect and encourage all private parties, including both content creators and Internet platform providers working together, to adopt voluntary measures and best practices to reduce online piracy,\" he said."}

{"text": "Over the years, more than 100 City players have represented 29 different nations at full international level, amassing nearly 800 caps between them and scoring well over 50 international goals.\n\nThis season, in a new series, Club Historian John Hutchinson looks at these players and at the footballing background of the countries they played for.\n\nThe Player - Kasey Keller\n\n\nGoalkeeper Kasey Keller is the only Leicester City player to be inducted into the USA Soccer Hall of Fame. After playing for the University of Portland and Portland Timbers, he made over 200 appearances in four years for Millwall before signing for Martin O'Neill's Leicester City in August 1996 for £900,000.\n\nHe helped his newly-promoted club to top-ten finishes for each of his three seasons at Filbert Street, during which he also played in two League Cup Finals, (winning one) and in a UEFA Cup campaign. Whilst at Leicester Kasey won 21 of his 102 international caps. Kasey then spent two years in Spain with newly promoted Rayo Vallecano in La Liga before returning to the Premier League with Tottenham Hotspur on a free transfer in August 2001.\n\nHe conceded the last-ever goal at Filbert Street when he was beaten by Leicester's Matt Piper. He played every minute of every game for Tottenham in 2002/03 and 2003/04, although he did concede four goals to Leicester City at White Hart Lane in a 4-4 draw in February 2004.\n\nAfter two seasons at Bundesliga side Borussia Mönchengladbach between 2005 and 2007, Kasey spent a final season (2007/08) in England with Fulham in the Premier League, before returning to the USA with Seattle Sounders between 2009 and 2011. As an international, Kasey played in the World Cup Finals in 1990, 1998, 2002 and 2006. He was CONCACAF Gold Cup winner 2002, 2005, 2007. He also played in the USA's 1996 Olympic team.\n\nThe Country - USA\n\nMany attempts to establish soccer in the USA had already failed when two professional soccer leagues were established in 1967. These were the FIFA-sanctioned United Soccer Association and the unsanctioned National Professional Soccer League, which featured the ex-Leicester City star, Howard Riley, who played for Atlanta Chiefs.\n\nThese merged in 1968 forming the North America Soccer League (NASL). This attracted ageing top players like Pelé, Franz Beckenbauer, George Best and Johan Cruyff, not to mention the ex-Leicester City players Keith Weller, the Birch and Frank Worthington. It collapsed in 1984 due largely to over expansion.\n\nIts successor, Major League Soccer (MLS), was conceived as part of the USA's successful bid to stage the 1994 World Cup Finals. Starting with 10 teams in 1996, it now consists of 20 teams, 17 from the USA and three from Canada.\n\nThe season runs from March to December and, since the Designated Player Rule of 2007, has featured players like David Beckham, Thierry Henry and, currently, Steven Gerrard. Internationally the USA men's team competed in the World Cup Finals in 1930, 1934, 1950, and then in every World Cup since 1990.\n\nHighlights included finishing third in 1930, defeating England in 1950, hosting the World Cup Finals in 1994, reaching the quarter-finals in 2002 and winning its group in 2010. They were finalists in the 2009 Confederations Cup and have won the CONCACAF Gold Cup five times between 1991 and 2013. In addition, the USA women's team have won three World Cups, four Olympic Golds and are top of the FIFA Women's World rankings."}
{"text": "Some of the biggest names in the technology industry are among the guests at the 61st annual meeting of the Bilderberg Group – a secretive talking shop for the top echelons of business and politics or a shadowy cabal seeking to rule the world, depending on whom you believe.\n\nEric Schmidt, making his fourth trip, will represent Google as the group meets at the Grove Hotel in Watford, UK. Another old conference hand, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, will also be there. Craig Mundie, formerly Microsoft CTO and now Ballmer's special advisor, is on the guest list, as is PayPal-founder and Facebook-backer Peter Thiel and online activist Lawrence Lessig.\n\nTechnology issues are on the agenda, according to the organization's press release. Among the 12 topics for discussion over the three days of the conference: \"How big data is changing almost everything\", \"Cyber warfare and the proliferation of asymmetric threats\", and \"Online education: promise and impacts\".\n\nAlso on the 140-person guest list is the head of the International Monetary Fund Christine Lagarde, president of European Commission José Barroso, government bigwigs from across Europe and the US (including long-time attendee Henry Kissinger), the heads of financial, manufacturing, and media companies in the US and Europe, and a light smattering of journalists, all of whom have been sworn to secrecy.\n\nSecret rulers of the world?\n\nThe Bilderberg Group takes its name from the hotel used for the first meeting back in 1954. The group was set up by European and US statesman as a confidential conference for the great and the good to discuss world issues candidly and openly.\n\nThe conference is hosted in a different venue each year in a quiet five-star hotel with good security and attached golfing facilities. Attendees are encouraged to speak their minds and are forbidden to discuss conversations in the conference with outsiders. This year's conference even has a no-fly zone set up over the hotel's grounds.\n\nFor years the group met behind closed doors and its existence wasn't mentioned in the mainstream media. But with the increase in information from internet communications, the news of the get-togethers got out and conspiracy groups got interested, not least because of the august attendee roll.\n\nFormer British professional footballer and now conspiracy-theory loon David Icke claims that Bilderbergers have created genetically-engineered blood lines of people to run the world as the captains of industry and use 3D projections to manipulate human perception and emotions. He also claims many are 12-foot, blood-drinking, shape-shifting lizards.\n\nIt has also been reported (correctly) that presidents Clinton, Bush the Second, and Obama all attended conferences before they were elected, as were British prime ministers Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair.\n\nThis is taken by some as proof that the group picked them for their roles, but Bilderberg founder and British cabinet minister Dennis Healey said that invitations are simply issued to people who show potential.\n\nIn an interview with journalist Jon Ronson for the documentary \"Secret Rulers of the World\", Healey said that the group was set up to allow people at the top of their respective fields to discuss world issues, and while attendance does give the advantage of networking, it's not a sinister cabal set on world domination.\n\n\"To say we were striving for a one-world government is exaggerated, but not wholly unfair,\" he said. \"Those of us in Bilderberg felt we couldn't go on forever fighting one another for nothing and killing people and rendering millions homeless. So we felt that a single community throughout the world would be a good thing.\" ®"}
{"text": "Game programmers at Red Fly Studios were once working for LucasArts on a game that would feature Darth Maul from Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. That game was eventually cancelled outright in 2011 as part of a clearing of the Star Wars canon for Disney's upcoming continuation. The at developer Red Fly is hoping to resurrect the project now that Star Wars games are returning to the market.\n\nWhen Disney bought the Star Wars property, all the previous \"expanded universe\" content got rejected from the official canon, leaving only the six feature films and the animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars. A few upcoming Star Wars games got the axe, most publicly a third-person action game code named Star Wars 1313 that would have featured the adventures of a young Boba Fett navigating the underworld of Coruscant. The Darth Maul game, titled Battle of the Sith Lords, was also cancelled.\n\nThe Maul game wasn\"t as far into the development process as Star Wars 1313 was when it got the axe. The development team had a title, but no script — just a hope at what a Darth Maul game could be, running around and beheading people with a double-bladed lightsaber.\n\nA developer of the Darth Maul game at Red Fly, a guy named Dan Borth, decided to take to Reddit as a way to raise awareness for the project, which the company feels is possible. It is going to require some fan support, though, as Electronic Arts has an exclusive Star Wars contract with Disney.\n\nBorth's strategy isn't entirely impossible, as creatives from Star Wars 1313 and developers at Naughty Dog (makers of the Uncharted series) have been hired by EA subsidiary company Visceral Games to produce a third-person Star Wars action game that may very well be 1313 revived. Red Fly would just need to make a deal with EA to release a game they pay a little money to develop and the game could be back on.\n\nBorth says they'd still like to focus the game on Maul, but on the character's origins, not on the continuing storyline of the Sith (for those that didn't watch The Clone Wars, yes, Darth Maul survived being cut in half by Obi-Wan Kenobi in Episode I). When asked what version of Maul's character we'd be getting, he answered:\n\nYoung Maul age 9 or 11 to right before Episode 1. We wanted to show what he went through to become a Sith. Showcase the torture the Emperor put him through. Show how you as the player would have made the same mistakes and ended up a Sith.\n\nMaul's origins were hinted at in The Clone Wars animated series, but the time period Borth mentions is still fertile canonical ground for a lightsaber combat game. Right now, Red Fly is working on a next-gen demo for a Maul fighter that would be similar to a Sith Arkham Asylum. The demo will be used to try to coax EA into picking up the game, as will your tweets and social media posts using the #WeWantMaul tag.\n\nIt does seem to be an awkward time to be pitching Star Wars content based on the prequel series as Disney's Star Wars revival has been pushing towards homages to the time-period of the original trilogy, not the prequel trilogy. The closest we've gotten to revisiting the Republic Era is catching up with aged characters on the new animated series Star Wars: Rebels.\n\nThen again, if Star Wars: Battlefront is EA's multiplayer effort and the Visceral Media project is their shooter-oriented Jediless game, there does seem to be a place for a Force-strong stylish action game.\n\nIf #WeWantMaul, that is."}

Montigny, a New Bedford Democrat, said the bill might help close the growing gap between the rich and poor.\n\n\"Tens of thousands of people are working full time and living below the poverty level,\" Montigny said. \"It is inexcusable.\"\n\nThe bill now moves to the state House of Representatives, which is unlikely to vote on a minimum wage bill until sometime next year.\n\nThe bill for the first time would index the state's minimum wage to inflation. Starting in 2016, the minimum wage would rise each year at the same rate as the consumer price index for the Northeast.\n\nSupporters have said the increase is needed because some companies are making strong profits, but lower wage workers are falling behind.\n\nOpponents, including some business leaders, said that an increase would hike costs for businesses and could prompt layoffs.\n\nJon B. Hurst, president of the Retailers Association of Massachusetts, said the association strongly opposed the Senate bill. Hurst said the bill goes too far in giving Massachusetts the highest minimum wage in the country.\n\nHurst said the bill would increase costs for employers, make employers less competitive and eliminate some jobs including those held by teenagers.\n\n\"We've got to be somewhat in line with what competitors are doing,\" said Hurst.\n\nRhode Island increased its minimum wage to $8 starting Jan. 1, while Connecticut and New York are raising their wages to $9 on Jan. 1, 2015, and Dec. 31, 2015, respectively.\n\nStates cannot approve a minimum wage that is lower than the federal standard, currently $7.25 per hour, but they can approve a higher one. Washington state has the highest state minimum wage at $9.19; followed by Oregon, $8.95, and Vermont, $8.60.\n\nAccording to California's new law, the state minimum wage would increase from $8 an hour to $9 an hour on July 1, 2014, and then increase to $10 an hour on Jan. 1 2016.\n\nApproval of the bill comes as advocates said they have collected enough signatures to place a statewide question on the ballot next year to bring the minimum wage to $10.50 in January 2016. Tipped wages would climb to 60 percent of the minimum wage under the ballot question.\n\nAccording to a study by the nonpartisan Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center in Boston, 17,800 workers in Springfield would be affected if the minimum wage goes to $10.50 an hour, with 14,600 workers currently receiving less than $10.50 an hour and 3,200 earning just above that.\n\nStatewide, if the wage rises to $10.50, 495,000 workers would be affected, including 440,000 because they earn less than that."}
{"text": "This Charming Riff\n\nMaybe it's because of the crescendo of chatter about a Smiths reunion, but I've had Johnny Marr on the brain lately. (Full disclosure: I am a total, drooling fan.) I keep coming back to how deceptively simple his parts are, with an emphasis on the \"deception\" part. There's always much more happening than initially meets the ear.\n\nPerfect example: \"This Charming Man,\" the band's first single. It's always been my favorite Smiths guitar performance — even more than the apocalyptic tremolo and harmonizer work of \"How Soon Is Now?\" Maybe it's because I'm still astounded by the originality and sheer chutzpah of the young guitarist, who was all of 19 when the track was released.\n\n\"This Charming Man\" is a perfect little pop guitar part, with an African highlife-inflected head and lots of pretty open-string chiming throughout. But the deeper you dig, the more you uncover. And you won't believe what I uncovered during my latest Smiths geek-out:\n\nI was prowling for Smiths content on YouTube, when I stumbled across this:\n\nYep — some unnamed benefactor has leaked the individual instrumental stems of this remarkable single. I've written previously about the series of illicitly leaked individual tracks from classic rock recordings available on the web, usually via the keywords \"mutlitrack masters.\" (I won't bore you again with the whole intellectual property argument — suffice it to say, I support these releases on educational grounds.) And this leak is a prize!\n\nHere's what Johnny told me about the performance when I interviewed him in '89, just after the Smiths broke up:\n\n\"'This Charming Man' was the first record where I used those highlife-sounding runs in 3rds. I'm tuned up to F# and I finger it in G, so it comes out in A. There are about 15 tracks of guitar. People thought the main guitar part was a Rickenbacker, but it's really a '54 Tele. There are three tracks of acoustic, a backwards guitar with a really long reverb, and the effect of dropping knives on the guitar — that comes in at the end of the chorus.\"\n\nSeriously — unless you read that, would it ever have occurred to you that there were 15 guitar tracks? Even after spending the intervening years listening for everything Johnny described, I still couldn't hear it. Till now.\n\nCurious about those acoustic guitars and backward-reverb sounds? We've got those too!\n\nAnd yes, I can finally hear those dropping knives! Naturally, it's on the open F#m chord (fingered as Em in Marr's F# tuning).\n\nThere are so many awesome details here: the not-quite perfectly doubled Telecasters. A thin, acidic bridge pickup tone that most players with \"good taste\" would scorn. The subtle changes in the acoustic guitar groove. The dissonant arpeggio and sweet harmonics in the chorus. The isolated tremolo accent. (And if you listen on headphones, you'll hear all the headphone leakage that accumulated over the course of those ambitious overdubs.)\n\nMy takeaway for today: Subliminal parts can be meaningful. Johnny talked about how he loved Roxy Music's albums, because every listening uncovered previously unnoticed details. It's those subtle, mysterious elements that keep the song so engaging after 30 effin' years.\n\nLet's give Johnny the last word: Here's a clip from a 2007 BBC documentary where he demonstrates the song's main riffs — but sadly, not the knife-dropping part."}

Slawomir Kaminski/Agencja Gazeta/via REUTERS\n\nThe demonstration began when a lone opposition MP ascended the parliamentary podium with a placard reading \"free media\" and was excluded from further debate or votes by speaker Marek Kuchcinski, who is from the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party.\n\nOther opposition members then joined MP Michal Szczerba on the podium, chanting \"free media\" and \"no censorship\", in the first such protest in the chamber for a decade.\n\nRelated Coverage Police break up blockade of Poland's parliament amid political crisis\n\nAs their occupation continued on Friday afternoon, the head of the PiS, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, told reporters those taking part would face consequences.\n\n\"We will not be terrorised.

Szczerba is from the centrist Civic Platform party, which lost power to PiS in elections in October 2015.\n\nRules proposed by the head office of the Sejm, the lower house, would ban all recording of parliamentary sessions except by five selected television stations and limit the number of journalists allowed in the building. They are due to take effect next year.\n\n\"This restriction, first of all, does not hit journalists, but the rights of citizens to be fully informed about what people elected by them to the parliament do,\" said a statement signed by Poland's largest independent news outlets on Friday.\n\nREFILE - UPDATING SLUGPeople demonstrate against new restrictions for media at the Polish Parliament in front of the Parliament building in Warsaw, Poland December 16, 2016.

Or so says our nation's paper of record.\n\nThe New York Times caught up with Los Angeles transplant Eric Shoemaker, a public relations executive.\n\nThey report:\n\nShortly after he finished college, Eric Shoemaker, a 34-year-old Los Angeles-based public relations executive, allowed his chest hair to grow out. \"I don't know if it was my age or becoming comfortable with myself,\" he said, \"but the thought of getting waxed — which makes your hair follicles bleed and you get ingrown hairs — you have to ask who you're doing it for.\" Mr. Shoemaker's decision came more than a decade after those touchstone Calvin Klein ads, featuring a smooth-torsoed Mark Wahlberg (then known as Marky Mark), popularized the hairless look, which was further endorsed in the next decade by the hit TV show \"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.\"\n\nA photo posted by Eric S (@blueshoe40) on May 3, 2016 at 5:59pm PDT\n\nThe paper also spoke to Gabriel Santos-Rocha, a 31-year-old model manager, who started letting the fur grow au natural eight years ago.\n\n\"I thought that the ideal body had no hair,\" he said. But frustration with all the upkeep nudged him back to his natural state. \"I hated dealing with the maintenance and the stubble and the itching that came with it,\" Mr. Santos-Rocha said.\n\nA photo posted by Caylan Hughes (@caylanhughes) on May 10, 2016 at 10:11am PDT\n\nMore from The New York Times:\n\nFor a new generation, the overly groomed body appears to be falling out of favor. \"We're seeing a return to '70s fashion,\" said Tim Bess, an analyst at the trend forecasting agency the Doneger Group. \"The late '60s and early '70s were about freedom, the hippie movement, having lots of hair.\" Mr. Bess cited Lindsey Buckingham of Fleetwood Mac — with his unbuttoned shirts and thatch of chest hair — as a prototype, adding that the preened look seems dated. \"It gets a little too perfect, too mannequin-looking,\" Mr. Bess said. Christopher Oldstone-Moore, the author of the 2015 book \"Of Beards and Men\" and a senior lecturer at Wright State University, in Ohio, believes that an increasingly urban and digitized life has left some men \"disconnected from their masculinity.\" \"There are different ways to connect to your organic masculinity,\" Dr. Oldstone-Moore said. \"Hair is one way to do it.\" An unkempt body is a perhaps unforeseen corollary of the lumberjack look that has long since peaked in certain Brooklyn circles. Even the brand2(x)ist, known for its sleekly textured models, has opted to show its underwear on the hairy frame of Nyle DiMarco, a recent winner of \"America's Next Top Model.\" Tom Speight, the brand's president, said, \"We've seen everything from man-buns to full beards go mainstream in recent seasons, and we want to reflect that rugged, a tad unpolished, yet approachable look.\" As with most things, it is probably not a bad idea to be wary of extremes. \"I think we're going to have to walk slowly,\" Mr. Bess said. \"Because if you go too far with it, it can look a little Neanderthal-y.\"\n\nH/T: The New York Times"}
{"text": "Four days around the New Jersey Devils and I'm convinced: This is really a team more people should be rooting for.\n\nThey're personable. They play hard. They also have a relatively exciting style that relies on a hard, two-man forecheck and creating turnovers that turn into offence.\n\nThey don't, by the way, block many shots.\n\nThey have game breakers (Zach Parise and Ilya Kovalchuk) and likeable pluggers (David Clarkson, Bryce Salvador, among others) and, of course, a 40-year-old legend in Martin Brodeur who is somehow looking spry again.\n\nThey even have a coach, in Peter DeBoer, who is a great success story after grinding out years and years in the OHL in relative anonymity.\n\n(Asked about the penalty box getting stuck shut on Wednesday night at Madison Square Garden, preventing Travis Zajac from going in, DeBoer said, simply: \"Yeah, I have [seen that before] I coached junior for 15 years. I've seen just about everything.\"\n\nThe Devils are also an underdog, as a sixth seed, and still finding ways to dominate teams like the Philadelphia Flyers through hard work and win games.\n\n\"We started every series on the road,\" Brodeur said after the Devils beat the New York Rangers to tie their series in Game 2. \"If we don't win on the road, we're in trouble.\"\n\nSo why do I get the sense of either (a) apathy or (b) genuine dislike for this team?\n\nProbably because of the jersey they wear.\n\nLet's face it, the Devils may have been the least popular team in this country over the decade between when they won their first Stanley Cup (1995) and their last (2003), as they became the face of the neutral zone trap and the Dead Puck Era.\n\n(What many overlook is how high scoring some of those New Jersey teams really were. They had the second most goals in the league in 1998-99 and 1999-00 and then led the league a year later.)\n\nStylistically, they've changed considerably under DeBoer, but perceptions for franchises are often very hard to shake.\n\nTo many, the Devils are still this no-nonsense, Scott Stevens led defensive squad that celebrated its three Cup wins in the parking lot -- even though they're now full of personality, led by Parise (who talked at length after Game 2 about how DeBoer pushes them to be aggressive in the offensive zone) and have a beautiful new rink that has a read-and-black pavilion out front to potentially parade around in.\n\nYes, this is another team with financial issues, with the new building not drawing as many fans as they'd like.\n\nYes, they're low on Canadian content, with Clarkson and Salvador two of only five skaters from this country.\n\nAnd, yes, GM Lou Lamoriello has a reputation for being crusty even if, like his team, that perception isn't reality. (Few hockey execs are more reasonable to deal with or beloved by their fan base.)\n\nBut there's a good argument to be made that, if this roster was dressed up like the Buffalo Sabres or Chicago Blackhawks or Los Angeles Kings (who seem to be this year's darlings), their bandwagon would be filling up right now.\n\nGive this Devils team a chance, get to know some of their players like Patrik Elias, Adam Henrique and Dainius Zubrus and watch their games while they're still in the playoffs.\n\nThey'll likely surprise you.\n\nReport Typo/Error"}

(Or, reading tips for dealing with fake 'racist uncle' think pieces this Thanksgiving.) But, yes, those parade floats are wonderful! And as harmless as their six-foot-wide grins and bulging eyes the size of car windshields might seem, there's an element of danger in 70 people marching a Spongebob that contains 16,200 cubic feet of helium through Manhattan once a year.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nGo ahead, Google \"Macy's Day Parade,\" and you'll find an entire Wikipedia section dedicated to \"Incidents and Injuries.\" There are entries every few years with phrases like \"head ripped off\" and \"impaled.\" But there was one year in particular, 1997, that was a total goddamn disaster. High winds caused chaos and destruction on the New York streets and one woman ended up in a month-long coma.\n\nOn Thanksgiving morning 1997, an estimated two million people gathered along the parade route to catch The Pink Panther, Barney, Cat in the Hat, and others happily float between the Manhattan skyline. But, as The New York Times reported the next day:\n\n\"At times, the balloons were not gliding but instead were careering as their handlers on the ground struggled to keep control in winds that reached as high as 43 miles an hour. For a while, the balloons seemed to be falling like flies. Barney suffered extensive damage and had to be removed at 51st Street. The Pink Panther succumbed at 42d Street. Quik Bunny and the Cat in the Hat limped away at 36th Street.\"\n\nA video from that day (see above) captures Barney's particularly violent death.\n\nNotice the drama of the handlers trying to keep control.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nAnd the surges of cheers/yells as the balloon rips apart. There's wind ripping at the camera, and the kid's cryptic commentary as Barney goes down.\n\nMeanwhile, \"As the Pink Panther lurched about, while simultaneously imploding, a police inspector shouted, 'Somebody give me a knife, quick!' An officer quickly handed him a 5-inch-long knife and he punched a hole through the feline's tail, a move that almost immediately stabilized the balloon.\"\n\nBut the worst problem that year occurred at 72nd Street and Central Park West, when a six-story-tall Cat in the Hat struck a lamppost. As Pat Klem, who videotaped the incident, told the Times:\n\n\"You thought it was going to bounce off,\" he said. \"But the second time it snapped -- it was suspended for an instant, then it spiraled way down ... The parade just stopped. There was a prolonged silence. Your thoughts go from happy, joyous Thanksgiving to prayers.\"\n\nMaria Clohessy and Kathy Caronna both suffered head injuries during the incident. And, a year later, CNN reported that Caronna \"Suffered a skull fracture from falling debris and was in a coma for nearly a month. Caronna, who is still recovering and says the accident caused permanent brain damage, filed a $395 million lawsuit against the city, Macy's and the lamppost manufacturer.\"\n\nIn response to what happened at the Macy's Day Parade in 1997, organizers implemented new size rules, that \"balloons can be no larger than 70 feet high, 78 feet long and 40 feet wide. That meant bidding farewell to a few lumbering creatures: the Pink Panther, Woody Woodpecker and the Cat in the Hat.\"\n\nBut remember: the parade used to be way, way stranger."}

The guide below however, works for people who are now on firmware 3.61 or above.\n\nNote: The following post was initially published by user xy2_ on GBATemp. We reproduce it below with the author's permission, to spread the word.\n\nSo apparently this isn't common knowledge and quite a lot people are still getting frauded by some of these \"VHBL ON LATEST FIRMWARE!!\" people without knowing how to do it. [Note from wololo: see our article on that topic here]\n\nIn particular, instead of contributing to useful efforts to advance the vita scene (shoutouts to #vitasdk on freenode) these specific people have for their interest instead to sell methods that are known by the experienced vita hackers, but not known by many end users, for the sole objective of profit; basically abusing obscurity. As someone who is currently trying to contribute to the Vita via documentation, this is a little unacceptable for me. Some examples would be HackInformer (the most known) and F3bruary, and I'm pretty sure some other people will do this as well as time passes.\n\nSo without further ado, here are three methods to install VHBL on latest firmware. They ALL require a person with a hackable Vita to do the work for you beforehand. If you don't have anyone, read the end of this post. For the VHBL bubble, use Ape Escape demo as a basegame.\n\nPS Vita 3.61 VHBL through Account sharing\n\nRequires your PSN login creds: the quickest but most unsafe option. The exploitable Vita makes a VHBL bubble via the method of their choice, makes a CM backup, and sends it to the latest firmware Vita.\n\nPros: easiest and fastest method.\n\nCons: requires psn login.\n\nPS Vita 3.61 VHBL with Backup hacking\n\nRequires a backup and physical access to the latest firmware Vita. The hackable Vita owner gets a backup from the latest firmware Vita, follows http://gbatemp.net/threads/coldswap-run-fully-unencrypted-playable-games-without-owning-them.427511/ to hack the backup, then gets the VHBL bubble to make a CM backup of the bubble and send it to the latest firmware vita.\n\nPros: does not require giving account or swapping it.\n\nCons: hardest method for hacker, requires physical access to the PS3 to activate (as act.dat, the file to activate a Vita, is console unique).\n\nPS Vita 3.61 VHBL: Account swapping\n\nThe hackable firmware Vita creates a new account, creates the VHBL bubble there, then sends a CM backup of the bubble to the latest firmware VIta. The latest firmware Vita either formats his vita or get a separate memory card for the new account and transfers the CM backup.\n\nPros: does not require end user input from the latest firmware vita.\n\nCons: have to switch accounts, memory cards aren't cheap.\n\nFor those who have no friends with a Vita: I am unfortunately not able to offer accounts anymore, due to lack of access to a PS3 for a long time. Sorry\n\nNote: I do **not** recommend giving away your PSN login creds unless you have absolute trust in the other party!\n\nSource: xy2_ on GBATemp"}

{"text": "AUSTRALIA has won its latest international tug-of-war for a promising young sportsman, pinching WA teen Cameron Burgess from Scotland's grasp.\n\nThe Fulham defender has starred for Scotland's youth sides for the past year, playing as recently as June, but has officially pledged his future to the Socceroos.\n\nFIFA this week officially granted Burgess a clearance to switch allegiance from Scotland to Australia, which binds him to Australia forever.\n\nA central defender who can play left-back or defensive midfield, Burgess will now be considered for the two November home friendlies by Socceroos coach Ange Posetcoglou.\n\nFootball Federation Australia yesterday confirmed the capture of Burgess, who played for Scotland's U19 and 20s and whose granddad Campbell Forsyth was capped by Scotland in the 1960s.\n\n\"Cameron Burgess is a talented young footballer making positive moves in his football career and we're delighted he has confirmed his desire to play for Australia,'' an FFA spokesperson said.\n\ndelighted to make my professional debut today! gutted about the result but a positive season ahead #COYW #FFC — Cameron Burgess (@CamBurgess95) August 9, 2014\n\n\"He is a young player we have been watching and we will continue to do so knowing he is committed to the Socceroos.''\n\nBurgess has been a bolter for Championship side Fulham, playing four full games this season after making his senior debut last month, age 18 years and 10 months.\n\nStanding at 194cm, the stopper has been deployed mainly as a defensive midfielder by Fulham boss Felix Magath.\n\nBorn in Aberdeen, his family moved to Perth age 11, where he was an ECU Joondalup junior and played for Perth Glory's youth team, before signing for Fulham in 2011.\n\nIt's believed Postecoglou considered calling Burgess up to the current camp for the Belgium and Saudi Arabia games, but was unsure if the clearance would be granted on time.\n\nThe same clearance was required for Liverpool's Sydney-born and raised left-back Brad Smith, who's represented England's youth sides for the past four years but made his Socceroos debut against Belgium on Friday.\n\nHaving been picked in an Australian U20 camp earlier this year, Burgess is now likely to be selected for the Young Socceroos' U20 World Cup qualifiers in October in Myanmar (October 9-23).\n\nCameron Burgess made his debut for Fulham this season. Source: Getty Images\n\nWith the Socceroos due to play UAE and Qatar on October 10 and 14, a senior call-up beckons in November, which will be Postecoglou's final camp before picking his squad for January's Asian Cup.\n\nBurgess' capture is a two-pronged win for Australia - it gives Postecoglou another long-term option in the problematic defensive third, where depth has been tested since the retirements of Craig Moore, Tony Popovic and Tony Vidmar while Lucas Neill appears to have played his last game.\n\nCurtis Good and Rhys Williams missed the World Cup through injury, as did WA product Trent Sainsbury, who started in the loss to Belgium.\n\nIt's with great irony that Australia secured Burgess the same way it lost fellow left-footed stopper Ersan Gulum to Turkey.\n\nThe Melbourne-born Australian youth international switched allegiance to Turkey after overtures from Guus Hiddink, but having been uncapped in 2013 he and FFA tried to overturn his change.\n\nBut FIFA's steadfast rules prevented him from doing so, though the Besiktas defender has since become a Turkey regular."}
{"text": "Some Chicago residents are fed up with the city's pothole problem so they are taking matters into their own hands. Residents and members of a community group are fixing the holes themselves. The South Austin Coalition is helping residents make rides on their pock-marked streets a little smoother by providing the material needed to fill potholes.\n\nPotholes are everywhere. Many Chicagoans say they have to drive in the city looking down to see potholes, and that is not considered the safe way to drive. How do you avoid them? Some residents have decided to do their part. They believe the Chicago Department of Transportation is not repairing potholes fast enough, and they have become dangerous.\n\n\"You can't walk out there. You walking out there in the street at night, you can fall down and break your arm,\" said Florida Vaires, concerned Austin resident.\n\n\"The city hasn't done anything about the potholes on this block. Members of the community are taking matters into their own hands instead of doing it themselves,\" said Elce Redmond, South Austin Coalition Community Council.\n\nAngry residents of the South Austin Coalition Community Council, who live in the 4800-block West Van Buren, have decided to take the pothole situation into their own hands and have started repairing potholes themselves. The coalition is supplying the blacktop to fill them and the residents are doing the work.\n\n\"I'm proud of these people. These people are trying to get the streets together, because it seems like the city is not doing anything around these type of neighborhoods,\" said Antoine Noifleet, Austin resident.\n\n\"In the last two months on the 4800-block of West Van Buren, we've received just one call about potholes,\" said Brian Steele, Chicago Department of Transportation.\n\n\"We are inundated with potholes, very dangerous potholes,\" said Redmond.\n\nCDOT does not recommend residents fill the potholes for a number of reasons.\n\n\"Safety. We don't want people out on the street among active traffic. Secondly, we don't know what type of material they're using,\" Steele said.\n\nThe big question is who is responsible legally if someone gets hurt or destroys their car on a pothole repaired by a resident.\n\n\"That's a very good question, one I don't have an answer to. That's the reason why infrastructure repairs are under the purview and the responsibility of the city,\" said Steele.\n\n\"Are we willing to take responsibility? That's a good question, and one I have to look at in terms of our legal department,\" Redmond said.\n\nPotholes can be found across the city. ABC7 drove to other blocks in the Austin Community and found potholes then went to the north Side and found too many to count.\n\nAvoiding them can take work and they can destroy your car.\n\n\"The city has not received state funding for arterial street resurfacing since 2006. Typically we would do about 30, 40 miles of street resurfacing. We haven't been able to do that the last three years. That's starting to take its toll,\" said Steele.\n\nAustin residents say they will continue to fill the potholes on their own.\n\nThe Chicago Department of Transportation says they are aggressively attacking potholes. They have filled over 300,000 since December 1 and fill close to 5,000 a day. The problem is there are too many.\n\nOfficials say the federal stimulus package will help the city resurface over 40 miles of streets, and the state will also provide money for over 100 miles of resurfacing, so help is on the way."}

{"text": "A Los Angeles jury awarded a woman a $417 million verdict yesterday. The jury found that Johnson & Johnson failed to adequately warn users of the cancer risks of the talc in its baby powder.\n\nThe jury's 9-3 vote to hold J&J liable for not warning Eva Echeverria about cancer risks is a huge blow to the company, which is facing thousands of such claims across the country. The verdict consists of $70 million in compensatory damages and $347 million in punitive damages, according to Reuters.\n\nNo clear link connects talcum powder to ovarian cancer. Some case-control studies, based on asking women who have ovarian cancer about their history, have found a slightly increased risk. But as the American Cancer Society notes, those kinds of studies can be biased because they rely on a person's memory of talc use years after the fact.\n\nTwo prospective cohort studies, which don't suffer from that type of hindsight bias, found no increased risk.\n\nIt is plausible, scientists say, that talcum powder applied to the genitals could travel through the vagina and into the ovaries, causing inflammation. Since inflammation increases the risk of cancer, it's possible that talc causes cancer. But, again, the two most rigorous studies didn't find any link.\n\nHarvard University epidemiologist Daniel Cramer has published several studies, beginning in 1982, that found a link between talc exposure and increased ovarian cancer. Cramer worked as a paid consultant for the plaintiff's lawyers in a St. Louis case that resulted in a $72 million verdict against J&J.\n\nTalc, a clay mineral found around the world, is often used in powder form as a moisture-absorbing product and sold as talcum powder. \"Baby powder\" is a marketing term for cosmetic products that can be made from corn starch, talc, and other powders. Earlier versions of talcum powder sometimes contained asbestos, a known cancer-causing agent. But asbestos hasn't been present in talcum powder in the US since the 1970s.\n\nLandmark verdict\n\nThe Echeverria case was the first California talc case to go to trial, and the jury's massive figure will set a new standard for the many talc cases to come. Hundreds more are in earlier stages of litigation in California alone.\n\nThe 63-year-old woman used J&J's products for decades before she developed terminal ovarian cancer. Echeverria's lawyers said that J&J encouraged women to use the product, despite knowing about studies linking talc and ovarian cancer.\n\nThe case was the first state trial outside of Missouri, Bloomberg reported. J&J has faced five Missouri trials over the last two years and lost four of them. The company has been hit with verdicts as high as $110 million.\n\n\"J&J needs to see they not only have verdicts against them in St. Louis; they now also have them in Los Angeles,\" Mark Robinson, Echeverria's lawyer, told Bloomberg. \"There's a problem all over the country with women using talcum powder on a daily basis for 10, 20, 30, 40 years.\"\n\nJ&J has said they will appeal the case.\n\n\"We are guided by the science, which supports the safety of Johnson's Baby Powder,\" a J&J spokesperson told Bloomberg. \"We are preparing for additional trials in the US, and we will continue to defend the safety of Johnson's Baby Powder.\"\n\nBloomberg, which tallies large verdicts and settlements, says that yesterday's jury verdict was the third-largest of 2017. The largest (for $500 million) was ZeniMax's February win against Facebook over its virtual reality headset."}

{"text": "Across the country, U.S. cities are removing freeways in an effort to connect areas constricted by transportation planners decades ago. The city of Akron, Ohio, is the latest to reclaim its vehicular infrastructure for its citizens, and it's doing it in a revolutionary way: For three months next summer, a decommissioned freeway will be transformed into a 35-acre park filled with trees.\n\nThe Innerbelt National Forest is the idea of Hunter Franks, a San Francisco-based artist who has been working in the Akron community since 2015. He plans to populate the freeway with potted plants, public seating, and programming meant to reconnect the two communities severed by the freeway 40 years ago. The project just received a Knight Cities Challenge grant, which is giving $15 million to projects in 26 American cities.\n\nThe concept for the forest originated during a 500-person dinner on the freeway that Franks organized in in 2015, shortly after the road was closed. The guests at the community meal also participated in a visioning exercise where they were asked to write down what the neighborhood needed on butcher paper running down the middle of the tables. \"People said they wanted green space,\" says Franks.\n\nThe Innerbelt Freeway, also known as State Route 59, was completed in 1970, and designed to bring economic revitalization to the city's struggling downtown. Yet it was almost immediately declared a failure because it never delivered the volume of cars promised—or the revitalization.\n\nInstead, the freeway devastated the western edge of the city by demolishing historic neighborhoods, namely a African American jazz district, creating a physical divide through the city's urban core. According to Franks, one side of the freeway remains an underserved neighborhood where residents don't have easy access to downtown's cultural assets, while the other side is largely a commercial district populated by middle and upper class workers who commute into the area but don't live there.\n\nWhat Franks envisions is not just a park, but a chance to connect those two groups and create \"shared empathy\" in the space. Franks will be interviewing local residents, workers downtown, and students from a nearby university to give them investment and ownership in the project.\n\nAlthough the entire freeway has been decommissioned, with the last mile being demolished and reopened for development, Franks notes that this portion of the freeway will not be dismantled. The freeway itself will more or less remain intact, much in the way that Seoul recently transformed a former highway into a public park. So visitors will have the surreal experience of walking across the lanes where cars once sat in gridlock, surrounded by trees. Just taking away the cars means the area will be much safer: The Innerbelt had a higher than average rate of traffic deaths for the region, including the most dangerous intersection in the city, located on an arterial road that served the freeway.\n\nThe forest is set to open in April of 2018, and intended to remain open all summer. And although what the Knight Foundation is funding is just a pilot project, the idea is to test the concept, allow neighbors to give feedback, and use the data to perform future improvements, says Frank. \"Whatever it turns out being permanently, if it's a park or just helps inform the social landscape, that is the opportunity.\"\n\nIn this way, the temporary nature of the project is almost the most intriguing part—and one that offers the best model for other cities that want to \"test\" a freeway removal before implementing it. Imagine cities giving underperforming highways the summer off, shutting them down for the ultimate open streets event. Just a few months would give neighborhoods the chance to physically reconnect, help emissions and air pollution to drop, and provide citizens with a vision for how much better urban life can be without a freeway running through it."}

You'll also find how-to tips about educating yourself, choosing a roommate wisely, and starting worker co-ops and housing co-ops. Implicit in these essays is a critique of consumption as a lifestyle and of capitalism as a system that demands consumption to survive.\n\n\nAnother set of essays focus more on the \"Get Lost Generation,\" the Millennials or Generation Y, who came of age expecting that a college education would allow them to do it all, have it all, and change whatever discomforted them in the world they inherited. Society fostered some of these expectations. Others seem to have been mass delusions. In any case, the Great Recession dashed a lot of hopes and made young people re-examine the value of a college education, a job, owning a home, marrying (since none of them have turned out as expected, at least since the Great Recession). If you are white and from a middle-class background and a member of this generation, you will probably find yourself or people you know portrayed in this book. For a late Baby Boomer like me, it offers a chance to listen in to conversations and soliloquies I might not otherwise hear. I do think a limitation of the book is that it doesn't solicit the voices of Black, Latino, and/or immigrant youth. I have worked with people from those cohorts, and I think they would have a whole different set of concerns (and express shared concerns in a very different way).\n\n\nThe least developed set of essays in the book deal with the \"age of crisis\" we live in. When I was in my twenties and attending graduate school, I provided personal care to an old leftist who had suffered a stroke. One day, I told him that the undergraduates I taught didn't know about Vietnam or Watergate. \"They have no sense of history!\" I exclaimed. \"Neither do you,\" he retorted, and reeled off a series of important events from the first half of the twentieth century that I had barely heard of.\n\n\nSo, I am not in any position to blame the writers of this book for exaggerating the unique quality of the age they live in--but that is what they do. There is no sense that protest began before Occupy Wall Street. There are no references to the long history of cooperatives in this country, let alone Mondragon, in Spain. And few of these writers consider that some of the wonderful experiments in collective living, collaborative consumption, and political activism they are engaged in might not survive when they need enough income to raise a child, or health insurance for themselves, or money and leisure to afford to take care of an aging parent. (The essay \"Get on the Lattice\" by Ahlander and Kofman is a notable exception.)\n\n\nWe should all read this book--and share it with others. Then, we should invite friends and strangers to a potluck dinner and discuss what it means to each of us. That way, we can take up the challenge this book poses and carry it further."}
{"text": "Of course, there are already 15 physicians in Congress, and 13 are Republicans. Ralph Abraham is one of them: He practices family medicine in Louisiana and still sees patients a few times a month when he's not in D.C. His reasons for running in 2014 mirror Tran's: He wanted to fight for poor patients who were being priced out of healthcare. But unlike Tran, he blames the ACA for their woes. \"You can put those patients in a box and say, yeah, they've got insurance, but when it comes to pulling money out of their pocket, they can't,\" says Abraham.\n\nAbraham ran for Congress at least partly to oppose the ACA, and he voted to repeal it earlier this month. He puts little stock on what he calls \"speculative\" estimates from the Congressional Budget Office that 24 million Americans—and poor, old, or sick ones, in particular—would lose their insurance under the AHCA. \"I'll be the first to admit that our Republican plan is not perfect and I hope we can modify it so it's better,\" he says. \"But what we have now is not working.\"\n\nTran clearly disagrees. She feels that her physician peers in Congress are more interested in voting down the party line than in voting for their patients. She's not alone in thinking that. Several other physicians have recently felt compelled to enter the world of politics, especially after the recent attempts to repeal Obamacare.\n\n\"This is personal for me,\" says Jason Westin, an oncologist at MD Anderson Cancer Center who is running for the 7th seat in Texas. \"All of my patients have pre-existing conditions and I can't do anything in my current role to fight back for them. I've had a lot of patients who have problems with insurance. They're doing well in clinical trials of life-saving drugs, but their access is now threatened. This isn't a political football. This is going to hurt real people.\" And he is perplexed by the Republican physicians who have voted for the AHCA. \"The Hippocratic oath I took said: First, do no harm,\" he says. \"How could someone else who took that same oath look at the same bill and support it? I don't know.\"\n\nWestin remembers a moment after the election when he saw his 5-year-old daughter fall down during a soccer game. \"I went over and saw that she was fine, so I told her that we don't fix our problems by complaining. We get back in the game. That night, I was venting on Facebook and realized that I'm a hypocrite. So I looked for ways to get in the game.\" He realized that Hillary Clinton narrowly won his district in the 2016 election, even though Mitt Romney had easily carried the seat four year before. \"It's a highly educated area, with a major medical center. It's ripe for someone with a background in science and medicine to speak on political issues with authority.\"\n\n\"If we make our healthcare system better, we need to focus on quality, access, and affordability—and I think the AHCA fails on all three areas,\" says Ryan Allen, an emergency physician based in Austin, who is considering a run in Texas's 21st district. If he does, he will go up against Lamar Smith, Chair of the House Science Committee, whose attitude towards scientific evidence is also motivating Allen's interest in politics. \"He has lately made a career of obstructing scientific exploration and the use of scientific data.

That \"suggestion,\" as Trump has described it, has been condemned as bigoted by liberals and dismissed by critics as impossible to implement.In an email exchange with The Hill, Trump's national security adviser, Walid Phares, sought to clarify Trump's position.He argued that Trump's original proposal to temporarily ban Muslims was necessary in the chaotic moments following the San Bernardino, Calif., shootings in order to \"raise the issue and open a debate about it.\"Now, Phares says Trump's concerns that terrorists are seeking to infiltrate the U.S. by posing as refugees have been confirmed by government agencies, and so Trump can be expected to take a more nuanced approach on Muslim immigration going forward.\"The Obama denial that the Jihadi attacks, including in California and Florida, were triggered by a Jihadi ideology prompted Mr. Trump to ask what is behind the infiltration and to question why the administration is not designating the radical Islamist ideology as inspirer,\" Phares wrote.\"Hence, it is natural that the principle of a general ban will evolve into narrower policy suggestions during the campaign, and eventually when Mr. Trump is elected, he would direct the agencies and work with Congress to develop precise policies to detect the actual Jihadists. His statements were not against any community but warnings that the terrorists are penetrating every group they can.\"Phares said Trump is refining his proposal to hone in on the \"ideology and the movements behind the terrorists,\" rather than Islam writ large.\n\nThere have been conflicting signals coming out of the Trump campaign over the Muslim ban in recent days.\n\n\nIn December, Trump called for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our countries representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.\"\n\n\nAt a major foreign policy address earlier this month — conducted a day after the terrorist attack in Orlando carried out by a man who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria — Trump seemed to expand the ban by calling for a suspension on all immigration coming from \"areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism.\"\n\n\nBut Trump seemed to soften his tone while on a trip to Scotland earlier this week, during which he talked about distinguishing terrorists from \"peaceful Muslims.\" Trump said he wouldn't be bothered by Scottish or British Muslims coming to the U.S.\n\n\nStill, Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson argued on CNN on Monday that there had been no change in Trump's position.\n\n\nPhares, however, indicated on Tuesday that the Muslim ban will narrow going forward.\n\n\n\"He has been clarifying the matter over the weeks and months,\" Phares wrote. \"It is not that the issue is the ban but the issue is the Jihadi detection.\n\n\n\"If you look at international attempts to detect the threat, in Europe and the Arab world you see that many Governments are very clear as to who is behind penetration of their own countries,\" he continued.\n\n\n\"They cite the ideology and make the distinction very clear between moderates and radical Islamists. President Obama and Secretary Clinton still refuse what most countries fighting the Jihadists do: identifying the threat and designating the ideology. That's why Mr. Trump is pushing for an identification, as most Governments worldwide are doing.\""}

This is a very slight decline and a much higher rate of decline is needed if the goal of the elimination of TB in the United States is to be reached in the foreseeable future. This was a decrease in incidence from 3.0 per 100,000 to 2.0 per 100,000.\n\nThe incidence in 2016 ranged from 0.2 cases per 100,000 in Wyoming to 8.3 in Hawaii. Alaska, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, and Texas, as well as Washington DC, all reported incidences that exceeded the overall national incidence. Four states, California (2,130), Texas (1,333), New York (763) and Florida (602) accounted for 50.9% of all cases. Among the individuals for whom the information was available, 5.7% were HIV infected, 4.6% had been homeless at some point in the previous year, 1.8% resided in a long term care facility and 3.5% were confined to a correctional facility.\n\nCountry of birth\n\nAmong the 9,287 cases of TB reported in 2016, 2,935 (31.6%) occurred among U.S. born people, and 6,307 (66.2%) TB cases were among foreign born people. So foreign born people in the United States continue to be disproportionately affected. The top five countries of origin of foreign born people with TB were Mexico, the Philippines, India, Vietnam and China. These five countries accounted for 54.9% of all cases among foreign born people.\n\nTB cases for U.S. born people and foreign born people 2015\n\nIn 2015 of those people born in the U.S. 36% were Black/African American, 31% were White, and 21% Hispanic/Latino. Of those people who were foreign born 48% were Asian, 32% Hispanic/Latino and 13% Black/African American.\n\nDrug resistance\n\nThe most recent year for which information about drug resistance, that is drug susceptibility data, is available is 2015. In 2015 there were 88 cases of multidrug resistant TB. Among the 88 cases 72 occurred in people with no reported history of TB disease. This means that they were cases of transmitted or primary drug resistant TB. One case of extensively drug-resistant TB was reported.\n\nNational no. of TB cases by year\n\nIn 2015 the number of U.S. TB cases increased compared with the previous year. This was the first time since 1992 that this had happened.\n\nThese figures are very different to those of the 1950s which are shown below. This is when the statistics for TB first started to be collected. The decrease in both the number of cases and deaths, is not only due to improved TB control, but also to the development of TB drugs.\n\nTB statistics United States by state\n\nCases of TB for each state in 2015, 2014 & 2013 & number of U.S. born people & foreign born people for 2015\n\nComment\n\nWould you like to send us a comment about this page?\n\nYou can read more about:\n\nTB statistics India\n\nTB statistics\n\nMajor Source for TB statistics United States\n\nReported Tuberculosis in the United States 2015, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, 2015 www.cdc.gov/tb/statistics/reports/2015/default.htm\n\nReferences"}

{"text": "[This post was jointly written by Nuno Lopes, David Menendez, Santosh Nagarakatte, and John Regehr.]\n\nA modern compiler is a big, complex machine that contains a lot of moving parts, including many different kinds of optimizations. One important class of optimization is peephole optimizations, each of which translates a short sequence of instructions into a more desirable sequence of instructions. For example, consider this LLVM code that first shifts an unsigned 32-bit value 29 bits to the left, then 29 bits to the right:\n\n%1 = shl i32 %x, 29 %2 = lshr i32 %1, 29\n\nAs long as %1 is not used anywhere else, this computation would be better written as:\n\n%2 = and i32 %x, 7\n\nUnsurprisingly, LLVM already knows how to perform this peephole optimization; the code implementing it can be found here.\n\nAlthough most peephole transformations are pretty straightforward, the problem is that there are a lot of them, creating a lot of opportunities to make mistakes. Many of LLVM's peephole optimizations can be found in its instruction combiner. According to Csmith, the instruction combiner was the single buggiest file in LLVM (it used to all be a single file) with 21 bugs found using random testing.\n\nWouldn't it be nice if, instead of embedding peephole optimizations inside C++ code, they could be specified in a clearer fashion, and if bugs in them could be found automatically? These are some of the goals of a new project that we have been working on. So far, we have produced an early prototype of a tool called ALIVe that reads in the specification for one or more optimizations and then, for each one, either proves that it is correct or else provides a counterexample illustrating why it is wrong. For example, the optimization above can be written in ALIVe like this:\n\n%1 = shl i32 %x, 29 %2 = lshr i32 %1, 29 => %2 = and i32 %x, 7\n\nEach optimization that is fed to ALIVe has an input or left-hand side (LHS), before the =>, that specifies a pattern to look for in LLVM code. Each optimization also has an output or right-hand side (RHS) after the => that specifies some new LLVM code that has to refine the original code. Refinement happens when the new code produces the same effect as the old code for all inputs that do not trigger undefined behavior.\n\nHere is what happens when the code above is provided to ALIVe:\n\n$ alive.py < example1.opt ---------------------------------------- Optimization: 1 Precondition: true %1 = shl i32 %x, 29 %2 = lshr i32 %1, 29 => %2 = and i32 %x, 7 Done: 1 Optimization is correct!\n\n(All of the example ALIVe files from this post can be found here.)\n\nThe proof is accomplished by encoding the meaning of the LHS and RHS in an SMT query and then asking a solver whether the resulting formula is satisfiable. The \"Done: 1\" in the output means that ALIVe's case splitter, which deals with instantiations of type variables, only had one case to deal with.\n\nOf course, the optimization that we just specified is not a very good one: it handles only a single register width (32 bits) and a single shift amount (29 bits). The general form is a bit more interesting since the optimized code contains a constant not found on the LHS:"}

{"text": "Annual growth of 3.5% stronger than the 3% forecast, boosted by a rise in exports and government defence spending\n\nThe US economy grew faster than expected in the third quarter, boosted by a rise in exports and a jump in government defence spending.\n\nAnnual growth of 3.5% was stronger than the 3% forecast by economists although a slowdown from the 4.6% pace in the second quarter when activity rebounded after the disruption of severe winter storms in the early months of the year.\n\nAn improved trade performance contributed to growth between July and September, with export growth of 7.8% outpacing imports, which fell by 1.7%.\n\nGovernment spending rose by 10%, following a 16% boost to defence spending, according to the data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\nDefence spending added 0.66 percentage points to the growth figure, increasing at its fastest rate for five years as the US mounted air strikes against Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq.\n\nHowever, the pace of growth in business investment, housing and consumer spending slowed from the second quarter, economists said. Consumer spending growth slipped to 1.8% from 2.5% in the previous three months. Fixed investment slowed to 4.7% from 9.5%.\n\n\"The report was broadly constructive, but with weakness emerging in housing and consumption spending, we expect the pace of growth to slip further in the fourth quarter,\" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.\n\nThe better-than-expected overall growth figure echoed the upbeat assessment on the US economy from the Federal Reserve chair, Janet Yellen, a day earlier. Calling time on the central bank's $4.5tn bond-buying programme, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) suggested recovery was on track with the economy expanding at a \"moderate pace\".\n\nMonetary policy would remain loose, it said, with interest rates likely to remain at a record low range of 0% to 0.25% for a \"considerable time\".\n\nHowever, the growth figures and upbeat assessment raised expectations the Fed might increase rates sooner rather than later, sending the dollar to its highest level in more than three weeks against a basket of currencies.\n\n\"The current and projected pace of economic growth is one of the reasons why we still expect the Fed to begin hiking interest rates earlier next year than is widely appreciated, with an increase next March still a distinct possibility,\" said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics.\n\nInvestors were feeling cautious as they considered the consequences of the third-quarter growth figures and the FOMC's statement. US markets opened slightly lower before regaining ground. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.9% and the S&P 500 was up 0.2%. In the UK, the FTSE 100 was roughly flat.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund has forecast the US economy will grow by 2.2% in 2014 overall, the same rate as 2013, and by 3.1% in 2015.\n\nNancy Curtin, chief investment officer of Close Brothers Asset Management, said: \"Our view that the US is recovering but not strong enough to trigger a reassessment of still benign monetary policy. The slow path to rate rises in 2015 remains. US growth is good for the world and augurs well for continued improvement in US earnings as we head into the fourth quarter.\" Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, said the Fed would be in no hurry to raise borrowing costs in the absence of inflationary or wage pressures. US inflation is currently running at 1.7% on the consumer price index and is expected to fall further as lower oil prices feed through."}
{"text": "Consuming cranberry products has been anecdotally associated with prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs) for over 100 years. But is this popular belief a myth, or scientific fact?\n\nIn recent years, some studies have suggested that cranberries prevent UTIs by hindering bacteria from sticking to the walls of the urinary tract, thanks to phytochemicals known as proanthocyanidins (PACs). Yet the mechanisms by which cranberry materials may alter bacterial behaviour have not been fully understood.\n\nNow, researchers in McGill University's Department of Chemical Engineering are shedding light on the biological mechanisms by which cranberries may impart protective properties against urinary tract and other infections. Two new studies, spearheaded by Prof. Nathalie Tufenkji, add to evidence of cranberries' effects on UTI-causing bacteria. The findings also point to the potential for cranberry derivatives to be used to prevent bacterial colonization in medical devices such as catheters.\n\nIn research results published online last month in the Canadian Journal of Microbiology, Prof. Tufenkji and members of her laboratory report that cranberry powder can inhibit the ability of Proteus mirabilis, a bacterium frequently implicated in complicated UTIs, to swarm on agar plates and swim within the agar. The experiments also show that increasing concentrations of cranberry powder reduce the bacteria's production of urease, an enzyme that contributes to the virulence of infections.\n\nThese results build on previous work by the McGill lab, showing that cranberry materials hinder movement of other bacteria involved in UTIs. A genome-wide analysis of an uropathogenic E. coli revealed that expression of the gene that encodes for the bacteria's flagellar filament was decreased in the presence of cranberry PACs.\n\nThe team's findings are significant because bacterial movement is a key mechanism for the spread of infection, as infectious bacteria literally swim to disseminate in the urinary tract and to escape the host immune response.\n\n\"While the effects of cranberry in living organisms remain subject to further study, our findings highlight the role that cranberry consumption might play in the prevention of chronic infections,\" Tufenkji says. \"More than 150 million cases of UTI are reported globally each year, and antibiotic treatment remains the standard approach for managing these infections. The current rise of bacterial resistance to antibiotics underscores the importance of developing another approach.\"\n\nAnother recent study led by Tufenkji in collaboration with McGill professor Showan Nazhat, a biomaterials expert at the Department of Mining and Materials Engineering, finds that cranberry-enriched silicone substrates impaired the spread of Proteus mirabilis. Those results, published online in the journal Colloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces, point to potential use for cranberry derivatives to hinder the spread of germs in implantable medical devices such as catheters, which are frequently implicated in UTIs.\n\n\"Based on the demonstrated bioactivity of cranberry, its use in catheters and other medical devices could someday yield considerable benefits to patient health,\" Tufenkji says.\n\n###\n\nFunding for the new studies was provided by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the Canada Research Chairs program, the Wisconsin Cranberry Board, the Cranberry Institute, the Fonds québécois de la recherche sur la nature et les technologies, and the Fonds de la recherche en santé du Québec.\n\nLink to the Canadian Journal of Microbiology article: http://www. nrcresearchpress. com/ doi/ abs/ 10. 1139/ cjm-2012-0744#.

{"text": "CBS This Morning on Monday eagerly hyped a new expose by the Washington Post: As a child, Donald Trump pulled pigtails and threw rocks at kids. This is the same Washington Post that went after Mitt Romney for allegedly forcing a haircut on another boy in 1965. Talking to reporters Marc Fisher and Michael Kranish, CBS co-host Norah O'Donnell wondered, \"You go all the way back to his childhood to help reveal some of Donald Trump. What did you learn?\"\n\nPost editor Marc Fisher revealed the not-so-startling revelations: \"We learned as he once said, he hasn't changed since second grade. Keep that in mind as you hear about some of the things that he did, such as throwing rocks at a toddler in the yard right across from his own home, pulling the pigtails of one of his classmates.\"\n\nFisher stated that Trump himself sees this \"as evidence that he was a mischievous, rambunctious kind of kid.\" He added, \"People who were around him during that time saw him as quite a ruffian, really.\"\n\nThe Washington Post book, Trump Revealed, is 448 pages. The hosts on CBS did not explain when they would release a similar effort on Hillary Clinton. As Brent Bozell and Tim Graham noted, the Post on August 15, devoted a front page look at the Democrat's 1969 college address. The headline oozed, \"At Wellesley, fiery speech was a breakout moment.\" Bozell and Graham wrote:\n\nIn 1969, Hillary Rodham Clinton gave a commencement speech insulting liberal Republican Sen.

It was a \"moment of glory,\" the Post proclaimed, the culmination of what \"her campaign now describes as social justice activism.\"\n\nIn contrast, the Post in 2012 devoted 5400 words to the \"pranks of a then-17-year-old Romney. In the 2013 book Collusion, Bozell and Graham wrote:\n\nReporter Jason Horowitz penned a 5,400-word \"expose,\" a bombshell. on how Mitt Romney may have pinned a boy down and cut his hair in 1965. 1965. Nineteen sixty-five. That's almost a half- century ago. Even if every detail in this hit piece was accurate-and they weren't-how is it relevant? The same journalists that who couldn't find anything relevant in the mistresses Bill Clinton or John Edwards were \"romancing\" in the risky present of their presidential campaigns could somehow find something more compelling - a haircut -- in the yellowed past of Mitt Romney's high -school career. The Post carried several full pages of breathless prose under the big headline \"Romney's pranks could go too far.\" The Post reported that Romney's Cranbrook schoolmate John Lauber was \"perpetually teased for his nonconformity and presumed homosexuality,\" and that he screamed for help as a brutish Romney held him down and forcibly hacked off his hair. Another student, David Seed, told the Post he ran into Lauber three decades later at an airport and apologized for not doing more to help him. Seed claimed Lauber said, \"It was horrible. . . . It's something I have thought about a lot since then.\" The paper recounted another incident in which Romney allegedly once shouted \"atta girl\" to a different student at the all-boys' school who, years later, came out as gay.\n\nA young Romney gave haircuts and Trump pulled pigtails.

{"text": "You need Tor, and Tor is asking for your support\n\nFor decades, privacy and freedom of thought and expression have been valued as human rights. Please take a moment to read articles 12, 18, and 19 of ↑The Universal Declaration of Human Rights dating back to 1948.\n\nIn free, democratic countries we took those rights for granted. Even without knowing or caring about human rights, among family and friends we chatted without being overheard, we shopped anonymously and paid with cash, we walked the streets anonymously without being afraid of unknown strangers crossing our paths. In libraries we read books and newspapers while nobody spied on our interests.\n\nThat situation has changed dramatically in recent years with two noteworthy twists. First, in an article worth your time Eben Moglen explained in 2013 (predating the Snowden disclosures!) how we have ↑entangled ourselves in the Net. We surround ourselves with all kinds of \"smart\" devices such as phones, smart watches, smart meters, smart TVs, e-book readers, glasses, cars, all of which have eyes and ears of their own, monitor our location, our communication, our behavior most—if not all—of the time. Apps in those devices transmit what they observe into the Net, under incomprehensible privacy piracy policies. Once in the Net, that data is traded, stolen, re-purposed—beyond our control, consent, or knowledge.\n\nSecond, for reasons that I cannot comprehend, (even) democratic governments seem to assume that our human rights do not need to be respected on the Net. They demand openly and enforce covertly access to our communication, to our data, effectively—the more we entangle ourselves in the Net—to our lives.\n\nIf you believe that the human rights to privacy as well as freedom of thought and expression should also be your rights, even if you move on the Net, you must learn and practice digital self-defense. Essentially, you need to choose apps and tools that respect your freedom and privacy, which requires ↑free software based on strong cryptography. For example, to protect your e-mails you may want to use ↑GnuPG as explained in ↑this guide to e-mail self-defense. As messenger you may want to switch to ↑Signal. For Web surfing you may want to use the ↑Tor Browser.\n\n↑Tor is cutting-edge anonymity research turned into easily usable free software. Briefly, Tor re-routes your network data through randomly selected relays on the Net, thus hiding who is communicating what with whom. More information on how Tor works can be found on the ↑Tor overview page and in the ↑Tor FAQ. Tor is built by a non-profit organization that is currently asking for ↑donations.\n\nMake sure to read the ↑download warning and try the ↑Tor Browser today. It's easy to install and run. Be warned, however, that surfing will be slower in general and that some misguided sites may refuse to load unless you solve a ↑captcha (which may or may not go away if you reload the page via \"New Circuit for this site\" from Tor Browser's menu underneath the onion icon).\n\nIf you like Tor, the project is asking for your ↑donations, and you are in good company: ↑Edward Snowden and Laura Poitras use Tor. Security guru ↑Bruce Schneier recommends that you use Tor.\n\nIf you don't like Tor, you can help to ↑improve it.\n\nAnd, as a final remark, if you believe that Tor is being misused by \"bad guys,\" then, of course, you are right. Tor, just like about any other tool created by mankind, can be used by law-abiding citizens as well as by the scum of the earth."}

Unions used to be powerful in the private sector. But now, most union workers nationwide are government employees. It has been this way since 2009. Since...\n\nOne of the biggest changes in the union movement has happened mostly under the radar, but it has big consequences for union officials, workers and the public at large.\n\nUnions used to be powerful in the private sector. But now, most union workers nationwide are government employees. It has been this way since 2009.\n\nSince 2000 unions have lost more than 2 million members in the private sector nationwide, but gained more than 200,000 members in government. Something very similar happened in Illinois, with union membership holding steady in government while membership dropped by 244,000 in the private sector.\n\nWith a long history of private-sector unionism, Illinois hasn't quite reached that point yet, but the gap has narrowed to almost nothing. Government union members could outnumber private-sector union members as early as this year.\n\nWith the shift to government unions has come a shift in union officials' priorities. Union bosses and lobbyists have long had sympathy for tight regulation of the economy and an activist government, but now they have a direct interest in the growth of government – that's where their members are, and that is the most likely place for them to find new members.\n\nAt the same time, union officials have much less reason to worry about the state of the private economy. For government unions, an economy that fails to grow is not a pressing concern because they can press for tax increases to make up any lost income and preserve government programs that employ their own members. This is a big part of why government unions – but not private sector unions – have been major backers of the progressive tax hike push.\n\nThe rise of government unions also has implications for health care. A few months ago many unions – almost all of them private-sector based groups such as the Teamsters, the Food and Commercial Workers, and the Laborers registered a number of complaints about ObamaCare. Government unions, such as the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees or the big teachers unions, however, have been much less vocal about the \"Affordable Care Act.\" The Service Employees International Union, which represents many government employees, is one of the few unions that remains unabashedly in favor of the law. Government unions can be blasé about the imploding health-insurance marketplaces because governments are in a better position to pay whatever is needed to maintain quality insurance than almost any private employer is.\n\nBecause unions now represent more government workers, they are less likely to bargain with businesses that are seeking to maximize profits and more likely to bargain with politicians who want to maximize their support. The temptation for politicians will always be to trade taxpayer money for union support.\n\nFinally, all unions have an interest in protecting their members from discipline. In the case of government, that means that unions make it harder for taxpayers to identify the people who enforce laws and run taxpayer-supported social programs, or hold government workers accountable for their actions. (Here's one example of where that can lead.) The inevitable result is a less transparent government, something that should be a concern for all of us – conservatives and liberals alike.\n\nUnion expansion into government has been going on for 30 years, and this trend is unlikely to change on its own. Unions have changed themselves. Illinois citizens need to pay attention to the changes in the union establishment. The old storylines, and the old sympathies for working men and women who once battled against big corporations, no longer apply."}

{"text": "NEW DELHI: Here's something ayurveda gurus like Charak and Susrutha may not have imagined. Modern ayurvedacharayas, homoeopaths and other Ayush doctors may soon be allowed to conduct non-invasive abortions. The health ministry has worked out changes to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Amendment Bill. The revised bill proposes to allow Ayush doctors to conduct non-invasive procedures on women seeking to terminate pregnancy. The draft bill will soon be sent to the Cabinet.\n\n\"We have made revisions to the earlier draft and proposed that Ayush doctors who are registered healthcare specialists be allowed to carry out non-invasive procedure, which would mean prescribing medicines etc,\" a senior health ministry official told TOI.\n\nAnother key amendment seeks to increase the period for abortion to 24 weeks from the present 20 weeks. The government's proposal, originally formulated taking a cue from a study conducted by Population Council, is aimed at increasing access to safe abortion by expanding the number of healthcare providers. Estimates show around 7 million abortions are conducted in India every year and over 50% of them are said to be illegal.\n\nInitially, the government had decided to allow midwives and Ayush doctors to do even invasive procedures for abortion, but dropped it following mounting objections from allopathic practitioners, particularly Indian Medical Association (IMA) and Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI). IMA, a pan India voluntary organization with a membership of 2.5 lakh allopathic practitioners, said even the latest move can put patients at risk as well as allow unethical practices and sex selective abortions.\n\nTOI\n\nDon't Miss 40.7 K SHARES 16.5 K SHARES 9.9 K SHARES 9.4 K SHARES 3.9 K SHARES\n\n\"MTP is a procedure meant to be conducted by an allopathic doctor only. It is not possible to allow restricted practice. How will the government monitor whether a person is conducting abortion through medicine or doing invasive procedures,\" says IMA secretary general Dr KK Aggarwal. According to Dr Aggarwal, abortions by a non-MBBS doctor can lead to critical medical conditions arising out of excessive bleeding or incomplete abortions, which can be difficult to handle.\n\nMinistry officials say FOGSI members were part of the consultations and initially supported the amendments. However, FOGSI has maintained that it changed its position after a thorough discussion. \"Expanding the number and type of providers able to legally perform abortion services, including manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) and medical abortion (MA), could greatly expand women's access to safe abortion and save many lives each year,\" Population Council said in a note on the issue.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) also seems to endorse the government's proposal. A technical and policy guidance for health systems by WHO released in 2012 states, \"Abortion care can be safely provided by any properly trained health-care provider, including mid-level providers....(e.g. midwives, nurse practitioners, clinical officers, physician assistants, family welfare visitors, and others) who are trained to provide basic clinical procedures related to reproductive health...\"\n\nTOI\n\nTraditionally, mid-wives have played a key role in catering to urgent medical needs, especially attending to pregnant women for child delivery or even for abortion, in rural areas and villages that lacked medical facilities. Though with time government health centres and private players reached many such villages, mid-wives continue to exist and attend to many emergencies even today. The government's proposal to involve Ayush doctors has also found support from the women and child development ministry, National Commission for Women and other women's groups.\n\n(Originally published in The Times of India)"}
{"text": "A popular slogan, often found on buttons and bumper stickers sported by hippies and other liberals, proclaims \"Hate is not a family value.\" Well, hate may not be a family value, but it is an innate emotion and integral part of universal human .\n\nAs we explain in Chapter 8 of Why Beautiful People Have More Daughters (\"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\"), ethnocentrism (or \" \") is an innate human tendency. We are designed by evolution to members of our group and hate members of other groups, in order to motivate and facilitate intergroup conflict. Yes, hate is natural. But remember the danger of the naturalistic fallacy -- deriving implications from scientific facts. \"Natural\" means neither \"good\" nor \"desirable.\" Nor does it mean \"inevitable.\" Most of us learn to overcome our innate evolutionary tendencies.\n\nBoth World War I and World War II lasted for four years. We fought vast empires with organized armies and navies with tanks, airplanes, and submarines, yet it took us only four years to defeat them. Now we are in the middle of what the New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman aptly calls World War III, a global clash of civilizations with localized struggles against enemies ranging from al Qaeda in the Middle East, to Jemaah Islamiyah in the South East Asia, to the Chechen rebels in Russia, to the Taliban in Afghanistan, to the Palestinian bombers in Israel, to the Sunni insurgents in Iraq. World War III, which began on September 11, 2001, has been going on for nearly seven years now, but there is no end in sight. There are no clear signs that we are winning the war, or even leading in the game. Compared to our enemies, we have much more money, much more technologically advanced weapons and machinery, and better organized and trained armies (although far fewer actual combatants). Why isn't this a slam dunk?\n\nIt seems to me that there is one resource that our enemies have in abundance but we don't: hate. We don't hate our enemies nearly as much as they hate us. They are consumed in pure and intense hatred of us, while we appear to have PC'ed hatred out of our lexicon and emotional repertoire. We are not even allowed to call our enemies for who they are, and must instead use euphemisms like \"terrorists.\" (As I explain elsewhere, we are not really fighting terrorists.) We may be losing this war because our enemies have a full range of human emotions while we don't.\n\nThis has never been the case in our previous wars. We have always hated our enemies purely and intensely. They were \"Japs,\" they were \"Krauts,\" they were \"Gooks.\" And we didn't think twice about dropping bombs on them, to kill them and their wives and children. (As many commentators have pointed out, the distinction between combatants and civilians does not make sense in World War III, and the Geneva Convention -- an agreement among nations -- is no longer applicable, because our enemies are not nation states.) Hatred of enemies has always been a proximate emotional motive for war throughout human evolutionary history. Until now.\n\nHere's a little thought experiment. Imagine that, on September 11, 2001, when the Twin Towers came down, the President of the United States was not George W. Bush, but Ann Coulter. What would have happened then? On September 12, President Coulter would have ordered the US military forces to drop 35 nuclear bombs throughout the Middle East, killing all of our actual and potential enemy combatants, and their wives and children. On September 13, the war would have been over and won, without a single American life lost.\n\nYes, we need a woman in the White House, but not the one who's running."}
{"text": "Despite the fact that 2015 was not a good year for the reputation of Planned Parenthood locally or nationally, Planned Parenthood's killing business in Columbia, S.C., skyrocketed last year, according to newly released data.\n\nThe S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) released its annual abortion report Friday, April 22, 2016, showing that the government-funded Planned Parenthood's abortion business rose by nearly 20 percent (19.8 percent to be exact) while the two private facilities in Greenville and Charleston lost business. Abortions in hospitals also declined.\n\nAll abortions occurring in South Carolina rose by a slight 1.2 percent in 2015 after a seven year period of steady decline, the DHEC report shows. (see the graph at www.sclife.org).\n\nSIGN THE PETITION! Congress Must De-Fund Planned Parenthood Immediately\n\n\"The uptick in killing unborn children lies squarely with the government-funded Planned Parenthood in Columbia, S.C.\" said Holly Gatling, executive director of South Carolina Citizens for Life.\n\n\"According to DHEC there were 326 more abortions there in 2015 than in 2014, she said. \"It goes to show what government funding does for the abortion industry.\"\n\nAbortions Performed in South Carolina by Facilityd: DHEC Data Facility Name Frequency 2015 Frequency 2014 Charleston Women's Medical Center 1,687 1,887 Greenville Memorial Hospital <5 Unavailable Greenville Women's Clinic PA 2,073 2,108 Medical University of SC 41 58 Piedmont Medical Center <5 Unavailable Planned Parenthood, Columbia SC 1,971 1,645 Self Regional Healthcare <5 Unavailable Spartanburg Regional Medical Center <5 Unavailable Total 5,778 5,709\n\nMeanwhile taxpayer outrage over the government funding of Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry in general is as strong as ever. This year the U.S. House and U.S. Senate voted to remove government funding from Planned Parenthood, but militantly pro-abortion President Obama vetoed the bill. There were not enough votes in the U.S. Senate to override the President's veto.\n\nOn Saturday, April 23, a huge crowd of pro-lifers surrounded the city block on which Planned Parenthood is located off Forest Drive in Columbia, S.C., to observe the nationwide organized protest of the country's largest abortion provider. Mark Baumgartner, the director of A Moment of Hope, a sidewalk counseling organization that compassionately reaches out to pregnant women going into Planned Parenthood, is disappointed by the DHEC data, but not discouraged.\n\n\"We need to redouble our efforts here and not lose heart,\" Baumgartner said. \"We have seen the facility in Columbia reduce its hours from 44 to 30 per week over the last three years. Let's not give up,\" he said.\n\nBaumgartner told the crowd Saturday, \"If we could each take just one hour per week to stand and pray for the unborn here, we could easily have coverage for every hour this place is open. More Christians present means fewer abortions.\"\n\nWhile it is always disappointing to get a DHEC report showing an increase in abortion over the year before, the pro-life movement still stands on the overall lifesaving gains, Ms. Gatling said.\n\n\"We mourn the loss of the lives of 5,778 innocent unborn children in 2015,\" she said. \"But we must give thanks for the lives that have been saved over the years because of the steady, faithful, long-range commitments of the authentic pro-life community.\"\n\n\"Overall abortions are down in South Carolina by nearly 60 percent from the peak in 1988,\" she said. \"There are at least 157,486 babies whose lives have been saved over the past 28 years.\""}

Not so his parents, who hired the 1st Special Response Group from the United States of America to go and bring him out....He was eventually found by a media helicopter in the Edgar Range near Mowla Bluff Before the news of his rescue broke , only hours before in fact, members of the 1st Special Response Group found the word \"HELP\" above a cliff in the Edgar Range Here is a picture of it from the newspaper in Perth (The West Australian) from 1999.I had often wondered where this was located, and thought I should seek it out. I asked here on Exploroz with no luck, no surprises there. So I asked the 1st Special Response Group about it and they put me in touch with David Kovar who was on the rescue mission. Mr. Kovar was extremely helpful, full of information though could not provide exact coordinates.He says, referring to a road he calls Looma Access Road, \".....base camp was off the road just to the west of the point where Looma turns south. The tarp was found approximately half a mile from the base at a bearing of approximately 80 degrees. From there, you'd proceed north until you hit a dry (at our time of year) creekbed. Then follow that to the west. Eventually you'll hit a significant drop - approximately 100 feet down. At the base of the drop was Robert's last camp and the worlds \"Help\" written in rocks.\"Believe it or not, that info was enough for me to determine the \"HELP\" sign location. So land based navigators - Could you have worked it out?Mr. Kovar provided a picture, here it is:Later Mr. Kovar found some more of his notes and says, \"We came to a location at which the creek aprons out upon a large flat rock (approximately 100 by 200 feet) and ends in a hundred foot drop waterfall. We observed a \"H E L P \" sign spelled out with small rocks on the rock apron with an arrow-pointing north. From the lip of the waterfall we could observe sign and ashes of a small campfire below.\"He also supplied some coordinates reinforcing his previous description:Help sign found half a mile west of this location:18 degrees 55 minutes 123 seconds South123 degrees 33 seconds 419 seconds EastThese coordinates are impossible (eg 123 seconds?? Seconds have to be in between 0 and less than 60) so once again I had to try and work out what they meant and it led me to the same spot as I had worked out previously.Anyway, on the 7 July this year I found the spot at 18 degrees 55 minutes 4.6272 seconds South, 123 degrees 33 minutes 3.7584 seconds East.Here I am at the spot where the sign was, as it has washed away. Note the tree, the hill on right and the small ranges in background.There was a huge drop and a beautiful canyon. A bit like Kings Canyon , only smaller.Dave from our party went down to the bottom, there was water there and some fish. Here he is looking across the canyon from where the HELP sign was.We couldn't drive all the way there as it was fairly hard to get down into the lower section where the canyon was. I went back to the vehicles and took these pictures of the crew coming back, and the canyon in the distance.Another one ticked off the list. Thanks a million to David Kovar.CheersAlan"}
{"text": "Horseshoe Bridge in Perth provides vital cross city traffic link 112 years after opening\n\nPosted\n\nPerth's Horseshoe Bridge — named for its unusual shape — continues to be a vital link for cross-city traffic, even though the railway line it once spanned is now underground.\n\n\"This is one of Perth's icons,\" Richard Offen, executive director of Heritage Perth, told 720 ABC Perth.\n\n\"Everyone knows of the Horseshoe Bridge because of its unusual shape.\"\n\nThe bridge connects the city and the Northbridge section of William Street.\n\nIts birth came during Western Australia's first mining boom — the gold rushes of the 1890s.\n\n\"When the Guildford to Fremantle railway line opened in 1880 there was actually a gated level crossing here at William Street,\" Mr Offen said.\n\n\"Each time a train came through a gatekeeper would come out and [open and] shut the gates — there were none of these modern boom gates.\n\n\"As the population grew during the gold rush, the frequency of trains grew and so did the road traffic.\n\n\"The result was gridlock in Perth.\"\n\nA footbridge for pedestrians was built in 1896.\n\nControversy arises after bridge opening\n\nBy 1903, the State Government realised it also needed to build a traffic bridge across the railway line — but there was a hitch.\n\n\"Because the buildings on William Street were quite close to the railway line on both sides, there was going to be a problem building a conventional straight bridge,\" Mr Offen said.\n\nIt was Robert Howard, a draftsman in the Public Works Department, who hit on the idea of bending the bridge around the buildings.\n\n\"The bridge opened in 1904,\" Mr Offen said.\n\n\"But it was immediately surrounded by controversy, because there were plans to demolish the wooden footbridge and an awful lot of people started complaining about it.\n\n\"Somebody worked out that they would have to travel an extra mile each week because the horseshoe bridge was longer.\"\n\nThe Daily News took up the issue, chastising the pedestrian opponents, in an editorial on July 8, 1904:\n\nThe structure had been built practically on the lines desired by the people, and now objection was being raised to the unsightly wooden footbridge which was never intended to be a permanent structure. It was a menace to the safety of the railways, and yet after all that had been done to meet the citizens' desires some people wanted two bridges instead of one.\n\n\"As usual, things calmed down and people forgot about that and realised that there were no more traffic jams,\" Mr Offen said.\n\nThe bridge was in use until 2009 when it closed for seven months for repairs.\n\nIn 2010, work began on the $360 million Perth City Link, which involved sinking the railway line under the Horseshoe Bridge and opening up 13 hectares of land for development between Northbridge and the CBD.\n\nTrains began running underground on July 18, 2013.\n\nThe space between the arms of the Horseshoe Bridge is now being developed into a public precinct called Yagan Square.\n\nAnd although the bridge no longer spans the railway line, it is still in use and now listed on the state heritage register.\n\n\"There aren't many bridges of this shape in the world and it has played a unique part in Perth's transport history,\" Mr Offen said.\n\n\"They have kept the gorgeous pedestal lamps which light the bridge and it is now going to be a wonderful backdrop for the new Yagan Square when that opens.\"\n\nTopics: history, 19th-century, human-interest, perth-6000"}

{"text": "The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's (RSS) attempts at re-writing Dalit history has drawn sharp criticism from scholars and activists.\n\nAs part of its efforts to aggressively push the Hindu nationalist agenda and consolidate the Hindu vote, the RSS has sought to introduce communal overtones to the origins of caste in a never-before-heard-of take on Dalit history.\n\nIn three recently released books on the subject, top RSS leaders have held foreign invaders responsible for the emergence of certain castes. The books, authored by BJP spokesperson Vijay Sonkar Shastri, were released earlier this month by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. RSS leaders have written the preface for all three books.\n\nAccording to a report in the Hindustan Times, top RSS leader Bhaiyyaji Joshi states in the preface to one of the books, \"To violate Hindu swabhiman (dignity) of Chanwarvanshiya Kshatriyas, foreign invaders from Arab, Muslim rulers and beef-eaters, forced them to do abominable works like killing cows, skinning them and throwing their carcasses in deserted places. Foreign invaders thus created a caste of charma-karma (dealing with skin) by giving such works as punishment to proud Hindu prisoners.\"\n\nCriticising the RSS for pushing a communal agenda with historically unsubstantiated claims, Dalit scholar associated with the Indian Institute of Dalit Studies, Dilip G Diwakar, said \"This is an unnecessary reactionary move by the RSS that is aimed to create antagonism between Hindus and Muslims. It is not merely a caste comment per se. This argument that is being made by the RSS is a very communal one.\"\n\nHaving played a crucial role in the BJP's stunning Lok Sabha performance, the RSS has been aggressively pushing its Hindu nationalist agenda. Recent headline-grabbing statements by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat calling on Hindus to unite and pitching India as Hindu nation have been interpreted as attempts to further consolidate the Hindu vote.\n\nAsked if he saw efforts to rewrite Dalit history as an attempt in that direction, Diwakar said, \"Of course. As long as Dalits see themselves as separate from the upper caste, consolidation cannot happen. One, the RSS wants to consolidate the Hindus and two, they want to create antagonism between the lower-castes and the Muslim community, which will indirectly benefit the consolidation process.\"\n\nThe move also drew strong reactions from Dalit activists.\n\nSaid Asha Kowtal of the National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights, \"This is another conspiracy by the Brahmanical forces operating in the garb of RSS. Our histories have been altered for centuries now and as a result of which caste-Hindu forces claim every space - in education, business, public life etc. This is clearly another way of breaking up the excluded communities - like Dalits, minorities and lower-caste groups.\" Kowtal is general secretary of the All India Dalit Mahila Adhikar Manch.\n\nThe intent, said Kowtal, behind this \"weird theory\" that foreign invaders were responsible for the emergence of caste, was \"clearly to push the Hindutva agenda and paint a picture that we Dalits are Hindus. This is linked with the statements being made earlier that all Indians are Hindus - living in Hindustan etc. This is clearly not the case.\"\n\nAsked whether activists would contest the Sangh's claims, she said, \"Our campaigns Dalit Mahila Swabhiman Yatra (#dalitwomenfight) is one of the attempts to organise our communities to challenge this kind of disgusting notions and reclaim our identity and self-respect.\""}
{"text": "Consumer law changed on 1 October 2015, as the Consumer Rights Act came into force. The changes cover:\n\nwhat should happen when goods are faulty\n\nunfair terms in a contract\n\nwhat happens when a business is acting in a way which isn't competitive\n\nwritten notice for routine inspections to be given by public enforcers, such as Trading Standards\n\ngreater flexibility for public enforcers to respond to breaches of consumer law, such as seeking redress for consumers who have suffered harm\n\nAs well as these changes there are 2 new areas of law covering:\n\nwhat should happen when digital content (eg online films, games, e-books) is faulty - the act now gives consumers a clear right to repair or replacement\n\nhow services should match up to what has been agreed, and what should happen when they do not or when they are not provided with reasonable care and skill (eg giving some money back if it is not practical to bring the service into line with what was agreed)\n\nOn 27 May 2015, some new rules contained in Part 3 of the Consumer Rights Act came into force. These are:\n\nall letting agents in England are required to publicise a full tariff of their fees\n\nadditional requirements on those selling tickets via secondary ticketing channels\n\nBecause of the act, the law will be clearer and easier to understand, meaning that consumers can buy and businesses can sell to them with confidence. On the rare occasions when problems arise, they will be able to sort out disputes more quickly and cheaply. The changes are relevant to all consumers and every business which sells directly to consumers.\n\nUK consumers spend £90 billion a month. Transparent rights will help them to make better choices when they buy, generating the opportunity for businesses to compete, innovate and grow. With these changes in place, businesses and consumers will create an economy based on productive relationships and fairly won business reputations.\n\nBusinesses and consumers who understand their rights and responsibilities will also save time and money.\n\n1. Businesses\n\nA better understanding of the law will help businesses to serve their customers well. For example, they can be clear with a customer demanding a refund exactly when their rights entitle them to one. And if a problem arises in how a business provides a service, it can be certain what it may be required to do about it.\n\nMore information and guidance can be found on the Business Companion website, or if businesses would like to speak to someone, they can call the Business Support Helplines.\n\nSmall businesses, in particular, may find our point of sale information helpful when implementing some of the changes under the Consumer Rights Act. This is available on the Business Companion website and can be found alongside the relevant guidance. This is some very simple wording which has been agreed by business and consumer groups. It can be displayed to help staff and customers understand rights regarding what should happen when purchases are faulty or not of a suitable standard.\n\n2. Consumers\n\nConsumers will better understand how they should be treated by businesses. They will be able to select the best deals and hold businesses to account more effectively for poor quality or service. For example, consumers will be able to compare important terms in a new contract more easily. They will be able to select the business which provides the best overall offer rather than simply the cheapest.\n\nThey'll know that they can get a repair or replacement if they discover a product is faulty more than 30 days after purchase/delivery. Of course, this only applies if the product was supposed to last longer.\n\nConsumers can visit the Citizen's Advice website for more information in advance of a purchase or if a problem arises.

{"text": "STARRING KEN WATANABE, KAZUNARI NINOMIYA, TSUYOSHI IHARA\n\n\nPLOT SYNOPSIS\n\n\nGeneral Kuribayashi takes command of the defences of Iwo Jima, a strategically important Pacific island 520 miles south of Tokyo. Aware that the victory is impossible, he orders the men to dig a network of tunnels; he means to fight to the last man, delaying the Americans for as long as possible. Yet many of his officers are outraged: tactical withdrawals are considered dishonourable, they would rather commit seppuku. Several soldiers reflect on their fate over the long, brutal and hopeless battle.\n\n\n***\n\n\nThere's a scene in Flags Of Our Fathers when the US marines hear a series of muffled explosions, then break into one of the enemy tunnels dug into Mount Suribachi. Thy're appalled to find the obliterated corpses of an entire squad of Japanese soldiers, just minutes after they've blown themselves up. Letters From Iwo Jima replays that incident from the perspective of Saigo (pop star Kazunari Ninomiya), an enlisted man who's horrified by his comrades' suicidal zeal, and who makes his escape before the Americans arrive. Saigo is no one's idea of a hero, certainly not his own, but he's the heart and soul of this movie, a grim reverse angle on WWII's bloodiest battle and the militaristic nationalism that decreed there should be no Japanese survivors.\n\n\nFew movie stars have interrogated the nature of heroism as doggedly as Clint Eastwood over the years, but whatever else he may have left to say on the subject, Letters From Iwo Jima could prove to be his masterpiece. Even more monochromatic than Flags…, Letters… resonates with the themes in the earlier film, deepening and darkening our sense of young men wantonly sacrificed in the name of the state.\n\n\nIn some ways this is a more straightforward picture, but not to its detriment. Beginning a few months before the US landings, it proceeds in linear fashion as General Kuribayashi (sympathetically played by Ken Watanabe) takes stock of a dire situation. Vastly outnumbered, denied reinforcements and air support (the Imperial Fleet has been decimated some months before), the Japanese have no chance of victory, even as they cling to the myth that the ruthlessly disciplined Japanese soldier is worth ten of his US adversaries. Ironically, his men's readiness to throw away their lives – to embrace death before dishonour – is the biggest hindrance to Kuribayashi's plan to make the Americans fight for the last inch of ground. Either way, Saigo loses.\n\n\nIris Yamashita's screenplay draws on published correspondence from the general and imagines letters from Saigo to his wife in Tokyo, a device that allows us to understand them as men, not just military pawns (in Kuribayashi's first voice over, he's apologizing for not having seen to the kitchen floor). This is also the key to the film's mood, which hits the same rueful and reflective tone you find in Unforgiven, Bridges of Madison County and Million Dollar Baby… all films about the dying of the light.\n\nDirected with simple fluency and grace, Letters from Iwo Jima illuminates a desperately dark historical episode with rare insight and conviction.\n\n\nIf Hiroshima is never mentioned, you might discern the shape of things to come in the ashen black sands of this volcanic outcrop. There is no triumphalism here, that famous flag-raising is relegated to the briefest long shot. This is a somber, moving, profound film that insists above all on the value of life itself.\n\n\nTom Charity"}

Saudi Arabia finds itself once again targeted by politicians such as Jeremy Corbyn and Lord Ashdown, who wrongly suggest that in some way we support radical extremism,\" he said.\n\n\"I prefer to believe this is misunderstanding, not malice. The contrary is an insult to our government, our people and our faith.\"\n\nThe ambassador said his country \"knows the reality of terrorism intimately\" and has been fighting it \"for decades.\"\n\nOn the question of funding, he insisted Saudi Arabia had \"stringent laws\" to stop financial support from private individuals or societies reaching terrorists.\n\nThe kingdom's cooperation with international partners in fighting terrorism had made the world a safer place, he said.\n\n\"However, the common mischaracterization of Saudi Arabia's role in the war on terror, perhaps deliberately and for political point-scoring, stands to impede cooperation going forward.\"\n\nSpeaking in the House of Commons on Tuesday, Corbyn said it is important to learn who is supporting IS before extending airstrikes against the group from Iraq into Syria.\n\n\"Who is funding ISIS? Who is arming ISIS? Who is providing safe havens for ISIS? You have to ask questions about the arms that everyone has sold in the region, the role of Saudi Arabia in this. I think there are some very big questions.\"\n\nAshdown made similar allegations against Saudi Arabia when he called the close ties between the British Conservative Party and the Gulf state \"worrying.\"\n\n\"The failure to put pressure on the Gulf states – and especially Saudi and Qatar – first of all to stop funding the Salafists and the Wahhabists, secondly to play a large part in this campaign, and other actions where the Government has refused to have a proper inquiry into the funding of jihadism in Britain, leads me to worry about the closeness between the Conservative Party and rich Arab Gulf individuals.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia: Fawning Cameron starts charm offensive as relations falter https://t.co/N9LRZxTVnkpic.twitter.com/jPj7LTzCpL — RT UK (@RTUKnews) October 30, 2015\n\nThe ambassador's comments follow a threat of legal action by a Saudi justice ministry official over a tweet which called the country's capital punishment regime \"ISIS like.\"\n\nThe tweet, the source of which has not been identified, was in response to a satirical cartoon which compared Saudi Arabia to IS.\n\nIllustrator Peter Brookes published the cartoon in the Times on Saturday.\n\nMy cartoon Saturday @TheTimes.

{"text": "The Healthy Michigan plan paid for by the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion likely wouldn't be sustainable under the expansion phase-out included in the repeal and replace proposal being pushed by House Republican leadership, Gov. Rick Snyder said Friday.\n\nSnyder, who co-wrote a letter this week with Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval and Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson regarding the American Health Care Act, said he has serious concerns with the proposal on several fronts, including its plan to deal with the insurance marketplace and its potential to impact Michigan's traditional Medicaid program.\n\nBut the changes, if implemented, could have the biggest immediate impact on the Healthy Michigan program, which currently enrolls more than 650,000 Michigan residents. Snyder said the additional costs of paying for any new entries after 2020 under the American Health Care Act would cost the state $800 million more a year, \"and that's not affordable.\"\n\n\"Essentially what you'd find is Healthy Michigan sort of winding down, where probably over 90 percent of the people on it would move out of the program within three years,\" Snyder said in an interview with MLive Friday. \"That's a huge number, and it's difficult to see where that would come from\" in the state budget.\n\nMichigan Gov. Rick Snyder critical of GOP health care plan\n\nThat estimate is in line with a state Senate Fiscal Agency report released March 8, which found that if the Healthy Michigan statute was changed to continue the program if the American Health Care Act was implemented, the increased cost to the state would grow to $532.6 million in Fiscal Year 2020-21 and $738.9 million in Fiscal Year 2021-22.\n\nIncluded in the letter to House and Senate leadership are suggestions Snyder and the other governors made to improve upon the American Health Care Act, including giving states more leeway to set up per capita systems, block grants or maintaining the current structure, depending on the needs of individual states.\n\nSnyder said he believes Michigan's program so far has been successful, and said some reform options could \"make Healthy Michigan even better than our traditional Medicaid program.\"\n\n\"We have people that are better off today - I clearly believe that's the case,\" Snyder said. \"Instead of being in the emergency room, they're now getting primary care. If you think about it, that's a better answer for them in terms of their quality of life, and it's a better answer for society, because in the long term that should save us resources.\"\n\nAlthough Snyder said he did not have time to discuss health care with the president when he visited the American Center for Mobility in Ypsilanti Wednesday, he said President Donald Trump, his administration and Republican members of Congress have been good about reaching out and hearing the concerns of governors.\n\nHe said he's hopeful some of the recommendations made by he and the other governors make it into the final proposal at the federal level: \"I think there's good dialogue going on, but I would hope they could incorporate it if not in the House plan, than in the Senate plan,\" he said.\n\nThe GOP plan, dubbed the American Health Care Act, would phase out the Medicaid expansion and switch to a new funding Medicaid formula in which states get a set amount of dollars instead of the federal government guaranteeing to cover a certain percentage of Medicaid costs.\n\nThe plan also would change the current insurance subsidies based on income to one based on age, which means younger people would get more help to buy insurance but many older people would see higher out-of-pocket costs.\n\nIn addition, the GOP plan would eliminate the requirement for Americans to purchase insurance, although they would have to pay a 30 percent penalty on premiums for a year if they go more than two months without coverage."}
{"text": "When it comes to weird tourist attractions, it's hard to beat a stuffed black bear that died of what many people consider the worst cocaine overdose in history. Nicknamed Pablo EscoBear, the unique tourist attraction is currently on display at the Kentucky for Kentucky Fun Mall, in Lexington.\n\nOn December 23, 1985, the New York Times reported about a 175-pound black bear that had apparently died of an overdose of cocaine in Georgia's Chattahoochee National Forest. Three months earlier, drug smuggler Andrew Thornton II had dropped large quantities of drugs from an airplane over that area, before jumping from it himself. Unfortunately, Thornton got tangled in his parachute and fell to his death in someone's yard, in Knoxville, Tennessee. Before turning to a life of crime, Kentucky blue blood Andrew Thornton II had worked as a narcotics officer of all things, and then as a lawyer. It is believed that he had built his network of connections during his time on the right side of the law, before becoming a drug smuggler. He was on a coke-smuggling run from Colombia when he dropped 40 plastic containers full of cocaine in Chattahoochee National Forest.\n\nPhoto: Kentucky for Kentucky\n\nBut instead of cocaine worth tens of millions of dollars, police found just 40 open containers with traces of cocaine in them, and a dead black bear. The animal had apparently feasted on the entire load and subsequently died of an overdose. \"Its stomach was literally packed to the brim with cocaine. There isn't a mammal on the planet that could survive that,\" the now-retired medical examiner who performed the bear's necropsy recalls. \"Cerebral hemorrhaging, respiratory failure, hyperthermia, renal failure, heart failure, stroke. You name it, that bear had it.\" A black bear dead from a cocaine overdose is not something you come across every day, so instead of cremating it, the medical examiner decided to have it stuffed. The \"Cocaine Bear\" was then gifted to the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area, where it was displayed in the visitor center, behind a plaque, without any mention of his special origin.\n\n31 years later, the guys at Kentucky for Kentucky remembered the legend of the Cocaine Bear and decided to track it down. It was easier said than done, as over the last three decades, the stuffed animal had changed hands several times. During the early 90's, the threat of an approaching wildfire prompted the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area to move its exhibit to a nearby warehouse in Dalton. From there, it was eventually purchased by country legend Waylon Jenning, who thought it would make the perfect gift for his good friend Andrew Thornton, a Kentucky native turned hustler in Las Vegas. So the Cocaine Bear \"lived\" in a Vegas mansion until 2009, when Thompson died. His possessions were then auctioned off and the legendary bear was purchased by Zhu T'ang, a Chinese gentleman living in Reno, for just $200.\n\nPhoto: Kentucky for Kentucky\n\nWhen Kentucky for Kentucky tried to get in touch with T'ang, his wife told them that he had passed away in 2012, but that the bear was still in his old office. She had never liked it and even after hearing its bizarre story, she was more than willing to part with it for free, as long as whoever was interested agreed to pay for the shipping. So they made arrangements, and it is now the main attraction at their Kentucky for Kentucky Fun Mall, in Lexington.\n\nNow, people from all around the world are reportedly coming to Lexington for a chance to see the Cocaine Bear, many of them fans of the The Bluegrass Conspiracy book inspired by Andrew Thornton II's exploits.\n\nSources: Kentucky for Kentucky, Lex18, New York Times"}

{"text": "A:\n\nWhen financing a company, \"cost\" is the measurable cost of obtaining capital. With debt, this is the interest expense a company pays on its debt. With equity, the cost of capital refers to the claim on earnings provided to shareholders for their ownership stake in the business.\n\nWhat Is Debt Financing?\n\nWhen a firm raises money for capital by selling debt instruments to investors, it is known as debt financing. In return for lending the money, the individuals or institutions become creditors and receive a promise that the principal and interest on the debt will be repaid on a regular schedule.\n\nWhat Is Equity Financing?\n\nEquity financing is the process of raising capital through the sale of shares in a company. With equity financing comes an ownership interest for shareholders. Equity financing may range from a few thousand dollars raised by an entrepreneur from a private investor to an initial public offering (IPO) on a stock exchange running into the billions.\n\nLower Cost of Financing: Debt Versus Equity\n\nProvided a company is expected to perform well, debt financing can usually be obtained at a lower effective cost.\n\nFor example, if you run a small business and need $40,000 of financing, you can either take out a $40,000 bank loan at a 10 percent interest rate or you can sell a 25 percent stake in your business to your neighbor for $40,000.\n\nSuppose your business earns a $20,000 profit during the next year. If you took the bank loan, your interest expense (cost of debt financing) would be $4,000, leaving you with $16,000 in profit.\n\nConversely, had you used equity financing, you would have zero debt (and as a result, no interest expense), but would keep only 75 percent of your profit (the other 25 percent being owned by your neighbor). Therefor, your personal profit would only be $15,000, or (75% x $20,000).\n\nFrom this example, you can see how it is less expensive for you, as the original shareholder of your company, to issue debt as opposed to equity. Taxes make the situation even better if you had debt, since interest expense is deducted from earnings before income taxes are levied, thus acting as a tax shield (although we have ignored taxes in this example for the sake of simplicity).\n\nOf course, the advantage of the fixed-interest nature of debt can also be a disadvantage. It presents a fixed expense, thus increasing a company's risk. Going back to our example, suppose your company only earned $5,000 during the next year. With debt financing, you would still have the same $4,000 of interest to pay, so you would be left with only $1,000 of profit ($5,000 - $4,000). With equity, you again have no interest expense, but only keep 75 percent of your profits, thus leaving you with $3,750 of profits (75% x $5,000).\n\nHowever, if a company fails to generate enough cash, the fixed-cost nature of debt can prove too burdensome. This basic idea represents the risk associated with debt financing.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCompanies are never totally certain what their earnings will amount to in the future (although they can make reasonable estimates). The more uncertain their future earnings, the more risk is presented. As a result, companies in very stable industries with consistent cash flows generally make heavier use of debt than companies in risky industries or companies who are very small and just beginning operations. New businesses with high uncertainty may have a difficult time obtaining debt financing, and often finance their operations largely through equity.\n\n(For more on the costs of capital, see \"Investors Need a Good WACC.\")"}

{"text": "What to Do About Opossums\n\nA gentle wild neighbor, the opossum is our only backyard marsupial and is rarely guilty of more than \"playing 'possum.\"\n\nAdapted from the book Wild Neighbors\n\nOpossums get a bum rap. Often seen as a pest and accused of everything from knocking over garbage cans to killing chickens, these quiet marsupials are rarely a threat and easily sent on their way.\n\nCommon problems and solutions\n\nOpossums are often accused, but rarely responsible for getting into garbage cans or gardens. They are certainly game to stop by and clean up the mess left by other wayward critters, though! They are often accused of killing chickens, something that happens very rarely. Most people complain about opossums just being there, rather than for any problems they cause.\n\nTolerance\n\nOpossum are not aggressive: their open-mouth, defensive hissing is merely a bluff to look vicious. And if that doesn't work they play dead when really scared!\n\nIf there is an opossum in the yard, don't worry. They aren't a threat, and more than likely they will be moving on in a short while. The best way to keep them from visiting is to have tight-fitting lids on garbage cans, not to leave any pet food outside overnight and to remember to pick up any fruit that has fallen from trees.\n\nBut far from being a nuisance, opossums can be beneficial for your garden, eating snails, slugs, insects and sometimes even small rodents. They'll even clean up spilled garbage and fruit that has fallen off trees.\n\nAnimal-proof Trash Cans on Amazon.com »\n\nHow to keep opossums out\n\nThe best way to keep opossums from denning under a deck or patio is to make sure they cannot get there in the first place by keeping any holes filled.\n\nIf you suspect a mother opossum has already moved in, wait until she leaves her den (two hours after dark is generally a safe time). Then, loosely close the opening with netting, straw or other fibrous material. This will ensure that an animal trapped inside can clear the path to escape, but one outside will not disturb the blockage to get back in.\n\nOpossum moms take their kids wherever they go, so there is not much chance that any babies will be left behind. But always check for youngsters before closing the opening. If the hole has not been disturbed for two or three nights, it's safe to assume that no one is inside and the hole can be properly filled. For permanent exclusion we recommend putting in an \"L\" footer.\n\nEvery now and then, an opossum will get into a house through a pet door. Encourage them to leave by closing the doors to all rooms and opening the doors to the outside. Opossum are usually not aggressive, so you may be able to help them on their way by gently nudging them with a broom.\n\nRabies\n\nPeople often mistake the open-mouth hissing and drooling behavior of opossums as a sign of rabies. However, this is just a bluffing behavior that opossums use as a defense mechanism. In fact, rabies is extremely rare in opossums, perhaps because they have a much lower body temperature compared to other warm-blooded animals.\n\nResources\n\n» Purchase a copy of Wild Neighbors, the go-to guide for useful, humane solutions to conflicts with urban wildlife.\n\n» If you are located within the D.C.

{"text": "Anyone who actually analyzes the dramatic uptick in Liberal fortunes, both in the polls and in voters in the recent byelections might conclude that there is in fact an ongoing, well thought out incremental strategy which may well position Justin Trudeau as a real threat to Harper in the next federal election.\n\nMost observers in the Ottawa press gallery, the major source of federal news and opinion for Canadians, haven't gone much beyond crediting him with \"celebrity status.\" They believe his rock star status will fizzle. No less a national pundit than Jeffrey Simpson devoted a column recently to deconstructing his policies on Keystone and the legalization of marijuana, and concludes he has to put a lot more substance behind these pronouncements to \"avoid the impression of shallowness.\" Michael den Tandt of Postmedia news makes the most simplistic conclusion of all: \"It's...possible Mr. Trudeau's charismatic personality has simply charmed voters -- for now.\"\n\nIt falls to L. Ian Macdonald, a former Mulroneyite, now editor of the highly regarded Politics Magazine, and a Montreal Gazette columnist to hint at what is in fact the Trudeau strategy: \"...his strengths are out on the hustings, and the byelection campaign played to that. And in a way, he may be benefiting from Tom Mulcair's dominant performance in question period over the Senate scandal. As one of Trudeau's advisers recently put it about Mulcair: 'He's killing Harper, but that makes him a killer.'\"\n\nPretty basic. Let Mulcair be the killer in the house -- that has little impact on ordinary voters -- and leave the Ottawa bubble for where Canadians live: be positive, hopeful, take a few swipes at Harper and answer what is indeed a desire for change with youth and energy. Show wherever you go how starkly you contrast with Harper. Be open, accessible, listen, show personality. And of course fill rooms to capacity, work the crowd.\n\nAbove all show demoralized Liberals that this is a renewed party. That means not more of the same, but rebuilding its values to some extent. Hence his support of the Chinese acquisition of Nexxen, and guarded support of Keystone -- all deliberate moves to separate him from his father's hated National Energy Program and to rebuild support in the emerging west. There will be more, and the pundits will be surprised.\n\nThey should also be surprised by the fact that over 300,000 Canadians receive Liberal emails -- constantly I may say -- that there are over 12,000 volunteers recruited across the country, and that the party has more individual donors now than any other party. This is the result of a relentlessly effective strategy of dozens of people signing up members at Justin's events, and his daily social media presence.\n\nThere is also a new and welcome strategy of forming alliances with provincial Premiers, an option only open to Harper in three provinces. Justin has taken this new strategy very seriously indeed, especially recently in Ontario and Nova Scotia. A Toronto Star headline the weekend before the byelections said it all: Trudeaumania good for provincial Liberals -- Justin's energy and Wynne's experience \"a match made in heaven.\"\n\nPremier Wynne was beaming at his side campaigning in Toronto Centre, and he will campaign for her in provincial elections expected in the fall. Trudeau's enthusiasm and room-filling ability already was seen to play a role in the October victory of Liberal Premier Stephen McNeil. They campaigned so much together that the Huffington Post called it a \"bromance.\" Justin even figured in Liberal campaign adds.\n\nBottom line: Fully taking advantage of Justin's immense grassroots appeal to build the party and its bankroll and not mounting too many detailed policy targets for the Conservatives to demolish. A sound strategy two years out from an election.\n\nALSO ON HUFFPOST:"}

(CBSNewYork/AP) — The parents of a terminally ill New York City woman are waging a court battle over whether to keep her on life support.\n\nGrace Sung Eun Lee, 28, became ill with brain cancer last year and is being kept alive by breathing and feeding tubes at North Shore University Hospital's palliative care center.\n\n\"We are trying to keep her alive,\" family friend Grace Kim said.\n\n1010 WINS' Mona Rivera reports https://cbsnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/right-to-die-2-rivera-w41-soc-bgibbons.mp3\n\nBut Lee's court-appointed guardian said her wishes are clear.\n\n\"Her use of her lips is very, very vivid and she says, 'I want to die,'\" attorney David Smith said.\n\nDoctors and Smith said Lee has made her wishes clear and medication is not affecting her ability to reason.\n\nA judge ruled Grace is competent to make the decision, but her parents immediately appealed.\n\nBefore she became ill, Lee was working as a financial manager and training to run the New York City Marathon.\n\nNow she is paralyzed from the neck down and breathing and being fed by tubes which she wants removed. Doctors said they would like to respect Lee's wishes and remove the tubes.\n\n\"She is desperate both because of her physical pain and the days that she's being made to endure in the hospital to simply have it end,\" Smith said.\n\nHer parents, the Rev. Manho Lee and Jin-ah Lee, have gone to court to keep her on life support, saying that removing the tubes would be suicide and would keep Lee from going to heaven.\n\n\"When someone sets a time and date to die, that is considered as a suicide and sin,\" Rev. Lee said through a translator.\n\n\"The family believes they know what's best. They know what's best for their daughter and they know best what their daughter thinks,\" the parents' attorney, Jeff Forchelli, told CBS 2's Carolyn Gusoff.\n\nFamily and friends claim that Lee isn't ready to give up.\n\n\"She wants to go home,\" Kim said.\n\nLee's family has been asking for prayers and posting updates on their legal bid on a Facebook page called \"Save Grace Sung Eun Lee.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the family posted a video of Lee agreeing that she would like to sign over her medical proxy to her father and that she would like to leave the hospital and be moved to a nursing home.\n\n\"We did it!!! God has heard our prayer!!! The hope is growing in her,\" the family wrote.\n\nWhen a man in the video asks Lee, \"When do you want to leave to the nursing home?\" she replies \"Now.\"\n\nBut Lee's lawyer said she has already made her decision known.\n\n\"The law is very clear, as it should be, that it's you and I who get to decide for ourselves what we want and not our parents,\" Smith told Gusoff.\n\nA spokesman for North Shore University Hospital said with all end of life decisions, it abides by the patient's wishes and follows the law.\n\nBoth sides are awaiting a decision from a panel of judges at the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court.\n\nShare your thoughts on this story below…\n\n(TM and Copyright 2012 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

{"text": "Earth's magnetic field is known to have flipped many times throughout our planet's history. Its dipole magnetic field, like that of a bar magnet, remains about the same intensity for thousands to millions of years, and then – for incompletely known reasons – it occasionally weakens and reverses direction. That weakening and reversal was supposed to take on the order of several thousand years. A new study by an international team of scientists, however, demonstrates that the last magnetic reversal – 786,000 years ago – actually happened very quickly, in less than 100 years, or roughly the span of a modern human lifetime. The study will be published in the November 2014 issue of Geophysical Journal International.\n\nThe discovery comes as new evidence indicates that the intensity of Earth's magnetic field is decreasing 10 times faster than normal, leading some geophysicists to predict a reversal within a few thousand years.\n\nThough a magnetic reversal is a major planet-wide event driven by convection in Earth's iron core, there are no documented catastrophes associated with past reversals, despite much searching in the geologic and biologic record. Today, however, such a reversal could potentially wreak havoc with our electrical grid, generating currents that might take it down.\n\nAnd since Earth's magnetic field protects life from energetic particles from the sun and cosmic rays, both of which can cause genetic mutations, a weakening or temporary loss of the field before a permanent reversal could increase cancer rates. The danger to life would be even greater if flips were preceded by long periods of unstable magnetic behavior.\n\nPaul Renne, director of the Berkeley Geochronology Center and a University of California Berkeley professor-in-residence of Earth and planetary science is a coauthor of the study. He said:\n\nWe should be thinking more about what the biologic effects would be.\n\nThe new finding is based on measurements of the magnetic field alignment in layers of ancient lake sediments now exposed in the Sulmona basin of the Apennine Mountains east of Rome, Italy. The lake sediments are interbedded with ash layers erupted from the Roman volcanic province, a large area of volcanoes upwind of the former lake that includes periodically erupting volcanoes near Sabatini, Vesuvius and the Alban Hills.\n\nItalian researchers measured the magnetic field directions frozen into the sediments as they accumulated at the bottom of the ancient lake.\n\nScientists at University of California, Berkeley then used argon-argon dating, a method widely used to determine the ages of rocks, whether they're thousands or billions of years old, to determine the age of ash layers above and below the sediment layer recording the last reversal.\n\nBecause the lake sediments were deposited at a high and steady rate over a 10,000-year period, the team was able to interpolate the date of the layer showing the magnetic reversal, called the Matuyama-Brunhes transition, at approximately 786,000 years ago. This date is far more precise than that from previous studies, which placed the reversal between 770,000 and 795,000 years ago. Renne said:\n\nWhat's incredible is that you go from reverse polarity to a field that is normal with essentially nothing in between, which means it had to have happened very quickly, probably in less than 100 years. We don't know whether the next reversal will occur as suddenly as this one did, but we also don't know that it won't.\n\nBottom line: Imagine that compasses now pointed south instead of north. It's not as bizarre as it sounds. It will happen when Earth's magnetic field reverses. A new study indicates the last reversal – 786,000 years ago – happened in roughly the span of a human lifetime.\n\nRead more from the University of California Berkeley"}
{"text": "Will forensic analysts succeed in doing what Bigfoot hunters have only dreamed of achieving?\n\nSkeptics and believers are holding their collective breath waiting for the results of a peer-reviewed, five-year study conducted by Texas veterinarian Melba S. Ketchum.\n\nKetchum claims to have isolated enough DNA samples from alleged Bigfoot hair, blood, saliva and urine to prove the existence of the legendary beast.\n\nWhile we're all waiting for an eventual thumbs up or down on Ketchum's DNA assertions, one group of Bigfoot researchers has gathered an impressive number of videos reportedly showing numerous images of Bigfoot (or Bigfoots, if you will) from locations around the country.\n\nMany new videos have been submitted to the online group Facebook/FindBigfoot (FBFB), including one striking video from September that reportedly shows a Bigfoot very near to the person who captured footage of the creature on his mobile phone.\n\n\"What's so amazing about this new video is how close the Bigfoot is to the camper's tent,\" Jack Barnes, chief video analyst for FBFB, said in a press release. \"A Bigfoot usually maintains maximum distance from humans, but this one couldn't have been more than 25 feet away.\"\n\nCheck out these Bigfoot/Sasquatch videos spanning 45 years from 1967 to 2012 (story continues below):\n\nPHOTO GALLERY Bigfoot Video Gallery 1967-2012\n\nThe new Bigfoot videos have encouraged the FBFB team, and many are confident that someone will soon grab that indisputable Bigfoot image or video for all the world to see.\n\n\"With all the mobile phones and video out there, we've seen a spike in the quantity and quality of Bigfoot submissions. We want to celebrate 2013 as 'The Year of Bigfoot' to remind people that each video submitted helps our community to learn more about these amazing creatures,\" Barnes said.\n\nWhether or not you believe Bigfoot exists, the FBFB video collection spans 45 years between 1967 and 2012 and begs the question: From a statistical point of view, is it reasonable to assume that every person who has taken and submitted these visual accounts is either confused or deliberately perpetrating a hoax? Or is it possible that even a small percentage of these eyewitnesses might have, in fact, honestly captured something unusual -- and similar -- on film or video and simply want to share it?\n\nAn Idaho State University scientist is also looking to 2013 to be the year when the existence of Bigfoot can finally be proven and skepticism laid to rest.\n\nISU recently approved anatomy and anthropology professor Jeffrey Meldrum's proposal to try and raise enough in private donations on Kickstarter.com to build a high-flying remote-controlled blimp -- known as the Falcon Project -- equipped with special cameras to catch Bigfoot day or night.\n\n\"The beauty of this system with the very high-tech camera equipment is that the initial surveying and identification of targets will take place from 2,000 to 3,000 feet in the air,\" Meldrum told The Huffington Post.\n\n\"It won't be this big, ominous blimp cruising over the tree lines, but it will be this little speck at night that's painted black with some lights on top. It'll just blend in with the starry background,\" Meldrum said. \"Most wildlife usually aren't as aware of things up in the air as they are of things at eye level and on the ground, and even if they did happen to glance up, they wouldn't take notice.\"\n\nMeldrum is working on the Falcon Project with project founder and previous Bigfoot eyewitness William Barnes. The pair hopes this aerial Bigfoot search will get off the ground in 2013 and result in definitive proof of the elusive animal.\n\nAre all Bigfoot images and videos faked?

{"text": "Jason Cipriani/CNET\n\niOS 7 adds a new interactive layer throughout the operating system. It can best be seen when looking at a wallpaper on your home or lock screens.\n\nWhen you change the viewing angle of your device by tilting it in any direction, any graphics present on the screen will appear to move. This adds a realistic layer of depth to iOS 7. So realistic, in fact, it reportedly has been making some users sick. Should you be in the motion sick camp, or simply hate the new feature, you can always reduce the motion effects throughout iOS 7.\n\nThe perfect parallax wallpaper is one that accounts for the new size (beyond that of the current screen resolution), has some depth to it, and provides a realistic feeling of movement.\n\nScreenshot by Jason Cipriani/CNET\n\nGeneral guidelines\n\nYou can use a photos taken on your device, which can make for cool-looking wallpapers. Keep in mind they won't conform to the sizes outlined above. You'll need to move the photo around when you're setting it as a wallpaper to get your desired look. In fact, when setting the wallpaper you can preview the parallax effect by tiling your device before you've actually set the photo as a wallpaper.\n\nWhen using a photo you've taken, try to pick something that has plenty of depth to it. The photo above has an object close in the foreground, with a blurred effect on items in the background. That depth in the photo makes the foremost object (in this case a Lego figurine) appear to move across the screen as I tilt my device.\n\nA standard artistic wallpaper, if you will, needs to also have some depth or texture to it. Look at the backgrounds Apple included with iOS 7. There are some that are nearly single colors, but all have some sort of gradient, pattern, or texture to them to make the most of the parallax effect.\n\nPicking a wallpaper that's a single color, with no depth or texture to it, will all but eliminate the motion effect. But picking a photo with depth to it and that's the proper size will create a true motion effect.\n\nSize it up\n\nThere seems to be some debate regarding the size of the wallpaper and what results in the best motion on iOS 7. However, the consensus seems to be that adding 200 pixels to each side of the current screen size of any iOS device will result in the best parallax wallpapers.\n\nHere's the suggested size for parallax wallpapers by device (WxH):\n\niPhone 5/5C/5S: 1,040x1,536\n\niPhone 4S: 1,040x1,360\n\niPad (third and fourth gen): 1,936x2,448\n\niPad Mini: 1,168x1,424\n\niPod Touch (fifth gen): 1,040x1,536\n\nIn order to crop or resize any images for a wallpaper, you can use a program such as Photoshop (which is a bit overkill for something like this) or use a free program such as Gimp.\n\nWhen you have a larger image, like a photo or a wallpaper you've found online, do not simply resize it to the dimensions above. Pick a center or focal point of the wallpaper, and crop around it to fit the proper dimensions. Resizing will distort your photo, resulting in a wallpaper that won't look good, and you're likely to hate.\n\nAnd that's it. Once you have a proper photo that's cropped to the right size, you're ready to make some awesome-looking parallax wallpapers. Please come back and share some of them in the comments below!"}
{"text": "When should we be alarmed about so much wealth in so few hands?\n\nThe Great Recession and its anemic recovery only deepened the economic inequality that's drawn so much attention in its wake. Nearly all wealth and income gains since then have flowed to the top one-tenth of America's richest 1 percent.\n\nThe very wealthiest 400 Americans command dizzying fortunes. Their combined net worth, as catalogued in the 2015 Forbes 400 list, is $2.34 trillion. You can't make this list unless you're worth a cool $1.7 billion.\n\n\"America's skewed wealth is one of the most critical issues of our time.\"\n\nThese 400 rich people — including Bill Gates, Donald Trump, Oprah Winfrey, and heirs to the Wal-Mart fortune — have roughly as much wealth as the bottom 61 percent of the population, or over 190 million people added together, according to a new report I co-authored.\n\nThat equals the wealth of the nation's entire African-American population, plus a third of the Latino population combined.\n\nA few of those 400 individuals are generous philanthropists. But extreme inequality of this sort undermines social mobility, democracy, and economic stability. Even if you celebrate successful entrepreneurship, isn't there a point things go too far?\n\nTo me, 400 people having more money than 190 million of their compatriots is just that point.\n\nConcentrating wealth to this extent gives rich donors far too much political power, including the wherewithal to shape the rules that govern our economy. Half of all political contributions in the 2016 presidential campaign have come from just 158 families, according to research by The New York Times.\n\nThe wealth concentration doesn't stop there. The richest 20 individuals alone own more wealth than the entire bottom half of the U.S. population.\n\nThis group — which includes Gates, Warren Buffet, the Koch brothers, Mark Zuckerberg, and Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, among others — is small enough to fit on a private jet. But together they've hoarded as much wealth as 152 million of their fellow Americans.\n\nMany of the richest 400 Americans amassed their wealth through successful companies and innovation. But they've all benefited enormously from a system of trade, tax, and regulatory rules tipped in favor of the wealthy at the expense of wage earners.\n\nTax policies, for instance, routinely target income from investments at lower rates than wages from work. These rules disproportionately benefit the Forbes 400, especially those working in finance.\n\nThis dominance endures across generations. As the French economist Thomas Piketty has warned, the United States is becoming an aristocracy dominated by people who've inherited great wealth and power.\n\nDo we want the next generation of politics to be dominated by the heirs of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos or Wal-Mart heir Jim Walton? If not, it'll take strong and strategic public policies to reverse these trends.\n\nRaising the minimum wage so all full-time workers can make enough money to live on would be a start.\n\nAnd overhauling the campaign finance system so the richest Americans can no longer dictate which political candidates will be viable is a crucial next step. In the 2016 presidential race, Bernie Sanders is the lone top-tier candidate who isn't receiving massive contributions from what he calls \"the billionaire class.\"\n\nThese policies may reduce inequality, but they won't slow the concentration of wealth. Achieving that goal will require reinstituting the progressive income tax policies of previous generations. Given today's economy, this should include a wealth tax on billionaires.\n\nAmerica's skewed wealth is one of the most critical issues of our time. Unless we defuse this threat to our democracy, we're destined to become a society governed by the sons and daughters of today's billionaires."}

{"text": "Greg Dyke believes publishing the full findings is an essential step towards English football regaining some degree of trust in Fifa\n\nFootball Association chairman Greg Dyke has written to Fifa's top executives demanding a report into alleged World Cup corruption is published in full.\n\nA 42-page summary report was released last week but quickly criticised by Michael Garcia, who spent two years investigating the claims of wrongdoing.\n\nThe report cleared Russia and Qatar of corruption over their 2018 and 2022 bids but said England broke rules.\n\nDyke wants Garcia's findings published, writing: \"We cannot go on like this.\"\n\nGarcia is due to meet the report's author, Fifa ethics judge, Hans-Joachim Eckert, on Thursday to discuss his criticisms.\n\nHe has said Eckert's report \"contains numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations\".\n\nGarcia also previously said the report should be published in full, although Eckert rejected this, in part to protect those mentioned in it.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device David Bernstein calls for World Cup boycott\n\nBut Dyke, who last week called Eckert's report \"a joke\", believes it is an essential first step towards English football regaining some degree of trust in Fifa.\n\n\"As you probably know the reputation of Fifa was already low in England and much of Europe before the events of last week,\" said Dyke in his letter.\n\nThe \"failure\" to publish Garcia's full findings, and Garcia's own criticisms, had \"resulted in a further decline in public confidence of Fifa\", Dyke continued.\n\n\"We cannot go on like this. Complete transparency is required if the actions of all those who bid, including England 2018, are to be judged fairly.\"\n\nEarlier on Monday, former FA chairman David Bernstein urged the FA to lobby Uefa for a European boycott of the next World Cup, unless Fifa implements reform.\n\nBut Dyke was never likely to take such drastic action, instead writing to Fifa's senior executives: \"Urgent action is needed if confidence in Fifa is to be rebuilt in England. The FA is of the view that this action should start with the full publication of Mr Garcia's report.\"\n\nIn his report, Eckert accused the FA of trying to \"curry favour\" with former Fifa vice-president Jack Warner, who quit in 2011 amid bribery allegations.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device World Cup bid: Greg Dyke wants Garcia report publication\n\nThe report said England's bid team tried to win the support of Warner, who is from Trinidad and Tobago, by:\n\nTrying to help \"a person of interest to him\" find a part-time job in the United Kingdom\n\nLetting the Trinidad and Tobago Under-20 squad hold a training camp in the UK in the summer of 2009\n\nSponsoring a gala dinner for the Caribbean Football Union, at a cost of $55,000 (about £35,000)\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of publication, Dyke said the FA had \"nothing to hide\".\n\nAnd Lord Triesman, chairman of the FA at the time voting for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups took place, has said he also wants to see the complete document after being criticised for failing to co-operate with the investigation.\n\n\"I'm never satisfied by seeing summaries by somebody else,\" Triesman told BBC Sport. \"In this day and age, people are entitled to see the original.\"\n\nTwo members of Fifa's executive committee - Jeffrey Webb and Sunil Gulati - have already broken rank by insisting that Fifa releases the full report. Now Dyke will hope his letter can spark further rebellion in Zurich as FIFA tries to steers a path away from the crisis."}
{"text": "The Denver City Council made a surprise move Monday, reversing an earlier decision that would have banned smoking marijuana on private property if it was in public view.\n\nIf the bill passes on a final vote next week, Denver residents will be able to smoke on their front yards, front porches or anywhere on their properties, regardless of whether it is visible from the street, sidewalk or anywhere else.\n\nIt is doubtful the vote will change again. But no one can be sure.\n\n\"This has been like a pingpong game,\" said Councilwoman Susan Shepherd, who on Monday offered the amendment that scrubbed the previous version of the bill approved last week after more than three hours of discussion and a public hearing.\n\nShepherd's reversal amendment was supported by seven members of the 13-member council.\n\nShepherd said the law banning front-yard smoking was against the will of the people, infringed on private property rights and was unfair to people depending on the type of property they own.\n\n\"It will lead to people snitching on their neighbors,\" she said.\n\nCouncilman Albus Brooks, who supported the front-yard ban a week before, changed his vote Monday.\n\nHe said that during the Thanksgiving break, he received calls from city leaders urging him to switch. He said he thought about the implications of police having to enforce the law.\n\n\"Their concerns were about private property rights and overpolicing in some of our neighborhoods,\" he said. \"It's a tough issue.\n\n\"Fear sometimes causes us to protect and doesn't allow our city to grow.\"\n\nThe council has been wrestling with this issue for several weeks, beginning with a bill drafted by Denver Mayor Michael Hancock and Councilman Chris Nevitt that would have put severe restrictions on outdoor smoking on private properties. That version would have banned smoking in backyards if it could be smelled by neighbors.\n\nThe council came back with another version that is basically the same bill heading for a final vote next week. It allows people to smoke on their properties or with permission from the owner.\n\nCouncilwoman Jeanne Robb last week introduced the controversial \"front-yard amendment\" that would have banned the activity on private property if it could be viewed from a sidewalk or street.\n\nDenver Assistant City Attorney David Broadwell said it would be a legally sound law.\n\nRobb's amendment narrowly passed last week and was booed by some marijuana advocates. Denver police Chief Robert White said it would be difficult to enforce and would be the department's lowest priority.\n\nCouncil members who voted for the new amendment were Mary Beth Susman, Charlie Brown, Paul Lopez, Robin Kniech, Brooks, Nevitt and Shepherd.\n\nCouncilwoman Debbie Ortega will offer a new proposal that would ban smoking anywhere within 1,000 feet of a school. On Monday, she admitted pushing for more restrictive laws to guard against social problems that may develop.\n\n\"I believe that it is our responsibility to be more restrictive, and then we can come back and look at where we need to make changes,\" Ortega said. \"It will be far easier to loosen things than taking those floodgates and try to close them sometime later.\"\n\nSandra Hagen Solin, who is part of Smart Colorado, which has been pushing for marijuana laws that are safe for children, said she was disappointed.\n\n\"We're concerned the vote changed because of concerns around enforceability, which begs the question about the overall enforcement of the program,\" she said. \"Sadly, it appears that at this point the City Council is siding with the marijuana interests over the community's interests.\"\n\nJeremy P.

{"text": "Most Popular\n\n3 A Woman Can Never Be Likable Enough\n\nThe largest trade associations have been around for nearly a century, and in the last few decades, many have taken an international scope. For instance, the American Petroleum Institute, which began in 1919 as a trade group for domestic oil companies, is now led in part by a Saudi government lobbyist and has offices in Singapore, Beijing and Dubai. ExxonMobil and Chevron are reportedly among the highest dues-paying members of API, but so is Aramco, the state-owned Saudi oil company. (The American Petroleum Institute, as Bloomberg has reported, now transfers money to attack ad groups like the 60 Plus Association.)\n\nHere's the rub. Citizens United allows trade associations, for the first time, to dip into their general treasuries—made up in many cases of both foreign and domestic money from businesses—and spend unlimited amounts on American elections. Before the Supreme Court began taking an axe to campaign finance, if a trade association wanted to spend on a federal election, it had to spin off a regulated and disclosed political action committee. Though foreigners can't manage a PAC, they are more than welcome to manage major trade associations like the American Petroleum Institute.\n\nHere's how it plays out this year.\n\nChemical companies do not want Tammy Baldwin, the Democratic Senate candidate in Wisconsin, to win. In addition to voting to move our energy system towards a clean economy and away from petrochemicals, she's a strong advocate for regulating carcinogens in household products, like cosmetics. But instead of beating her with an ordinary PAC or a campaign contribution to her opponent, the trade association for the chemical industry has chosen to take advantage of the Citizens United loophole to use undisclosed general treasury funds against Baldwin.\n\nThe American Chemistry Council made one of the biggest media buys in the Senate race in August by purchasing $648,600 worth of ads supporting Baldwin's opponent, former Republican Governor Tommy Thompson. Here's the ad:\n\nThe American Chemistry Council used its 501(c)(6) fund rather than its PAC, so it does not have to disclose where it got that money. The council has also used its 501(c)(6) to air ads in support of Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) and other pro-chemical industry politicians of both parties.\n\nWhere does the Chemistry Council's general treasury, otherwise known as its 501(c)(6), receive its funds? Well, according to its website, the largest foreign chemical companies in the world—Saudi Arabia's state-owned SABIC, the Chinese-owned Sinopec corporation and Japan's Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation—are dues-paying members, alongside American giants like DuPont and Dow Chemical.\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute also used its foreign-funded 501(c)(6) to air its own ads against senators like McCaskill.\n\nIn some rare cases, subsidiaries of foreign-owned corporations have decided to skip the trade association route and spend disclosed dollars on US elections. Recently, OdysseyRe, a subsidiary of a Canadian financial services company, gave $1 million to the pro-Romney Super PAC. As I reported earlier this year, 7-Eleven Corporation, which is owned by a Japanese holding company, gave to a Super PAC supporting Senator Dick Lugar (R-IN) during his primary.\n\nWhen the next Congress is gaveled in this January, a good number of lawmakers will owe their seats to groups financed in part by foreign-owned corporations. In the case of the American Chemistry Council and American Petroleum Institute, two Saudi-funded pro-oil lobbies active in the election, that could have wide ranging ramifications for our energy security.\n\nFor more on the plutocratic consequences of Citizens United, read Lee Fang on who's running the pro-Romney Super PACs."}

(Yonhap)\n\nMoon earlier said he will work to create 810,000 new jobs in the public sector alone if elected, adding they will also help fetch 500,000 new jobs in the private sector each year.\n\nThe second item on his list was political reform.\n\nThe upcoming election marks a rare, if not unprecedented, presidential by-election caused by the March 10 ouster of former President Park Geun-hye over a series of corruption allegations. The next president will be allowed to serve a full five-year term, but many presidential candidates, including Moon, have vowed to amend the Constitution to cut future presidencies to four years and allow the president to seek reelection.\n\nHis third priority as president, he said, will be to reform large conglomerates, which have long been blamed for a source of chronic corruption.\n\nA permanent and peaceful resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue came next, in which the presidential front-runner vowed to develop or improve defense capabilities to counter threats from the communist state's nuclear and missile capabilities during his presidency if elected.\n\nMoon also vowed additional support for the young, promising to temporarily expand the number of jobs in the public sector reserved for young people to 5 percent of the total from the current 3 percent.\n\nUnder his economic reform plans, he also pledged to increase the minimum wage to 10,000 won (US$8.85) an hour by 2020 from the current 6,470 won.\n\nHe then promised better working conditions and gender equality for women.\n\nThe liberal presidential candidate vowed better welfare for the elderly, promising to provide a monthly allowance of 300,000 won to all elderly people in the lower 70 percent of the income bracket, an increase from the current monthly payment of between 100,000 and 200,000 won, his election camp noted.\n\nHis pledges also included additional support for child rearing, a move also aimed at boosting the country's low birth rate.\n\nOthers included support for small, self-employed businesspeople and enhancing the country's overall safety.\n\nMeanwhile, Moon also pledged to significantly curtail fine dust pollution -- a major source of health concerns for city dwellers here -- if elected president.\n\nHe said he would reduce fine dust by 30 percent within his term by suspending old coal-fueled power plants during spring time, stopping the construction of new power plants, and strengthening cooperation with Chinese leaders on the issue.\n\nFine dust particles are thought to originate from both the western deserts of China and domestic smog sources.

And in the same spirit, we support more constitutional powers for our brethren in Gilgit- Baltistan… Even more than us,\" he added.\n\n\"But the federal government should avoid annexing the territory as a province, lest India may use it a justification to annex the territories of Jammu and Kashmir under its control,\" he warned.\n\nSeparately, Shaukat Javed Mir, one of the media advisers to the People's Party, said it were the governments of his party in Pakistan that had granted constitutional and legal rights and liberties to the GB people.\n\n\"They are our brethren and we are not antipathetic to their greater autonomy, but we cannot condone any move that would waste the blood of thousands of Kashmiri martyrs for freedom of the held territory and its accession to Pakistan,\" he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 10th, 2016"}
{"text": "A new meal program — which will be implemented at the start of the next school year — will require students living in dorms to deposit a minimum of $1,400 onto their WisCard for dining purposes.\n\nStudents in UW-Madison's dorms will see a new charge on their housing bill next year. The university will require residents to deposit a minimum of $1,400 on their WisCard, to be used exclusively in dining halls.\n\nAccording to Dining and Culinary officials, residents will pick a set amount of money — between $1,400 and $3,100 — to deposit on their card. The money can only be used in dining halls or unions and will be forfeited if not used up by the end of the academic year.\n\nThe change to a \"tiered\" resident meal plan is an attempt to be \"upfront\" and \"transparent\" with parents concerned their student was spending more than anticipated in dining halls, according to Director of Dining and Culinary Services Peter Testory.\n\n\"[This system] is really giving people a better picture as to how many meals a week do you think you are going to eat in the residence hall,\" Testory said. \"[It gives you an idea of] the amount of money that you should look at spending for the entire academic year.\"\n\nWhile in the past the university simply informed residents about how much an average student spends throughout the year, Testory said a required tier system will allow the university to understand its budget, and therefore keep food prices low for students.\n\nTestory said the minimum spend tiers were determined based on the historical average spending rates on campus. He said that, while the average amount of money a student spends in the dining hall each year is around $1,200, students also spend an average of $200 in the Unions — which is how they settled on the $1,400 minimum.\n\nThe minimum tier — \"Bronze\" — equates to approximately nine meals a week. Those who choose the \"Silver\" and \"Gold\" tiers must deposit more money but will receive incentives, like bonus dining cash and free beverages.\n\nA student enters the silver tier by putting between $2,100 and $3,099 on their card, and the gold tier by depositing a minimum amount of $3,100.\n\nThe money will be deposited into a specific Resident Food Account on the students' WisCards . Students who wish to purchase non-food products with their WisCard at locations like the University Bookstore must transfer supplementary money onto their card.\n\nDespite the new required minimum deposits that incentivize students to spend more money at the dining hall, all food purchases in the dining halls will remain à la carte — students will continue to pay only for what they eat.\n\nTestory acknowledged that some students may not be able to afford the required dining fee. He said that although there is currently \"no solidified plan\" to deal with that, the department will have a solution before the new plan begins next year.\n\n\"Food insecurity on campus is a big issue, and it is a big issue for us as a department,\" he said. \"We are working on a process to address students who fall within that category.\"\n\nStudents living off-campus will still be able to get a five percent discount on dining hall-prepared food under the new system, but will not be required to deposit a minimum amount of money.\n\nTestory said that while dining service officials are discussing a way to offer off-campus students a type of meal program, their focus right now is on the resident meal program.\n\n\"We didn't really change our current model,\" Testory said. \"We took the information we had and tried to lay it out a little clearer with this plan.\""}

The next three largest parties command no more than 10 or 11 percent of the vote each.\n\n\"The overwhelming majority of Dutchmen basically do not vote for (Wilders),\" said Kristof Jacobs, a teacher at Radbout University in Nijmegen.\n\nNO \"NEXIT\"\n\nSo a victory for Wilders is unlikely to lead to the Netherlands leaving the European Union, closing the border to Muslim immigrants or reinstating the Dutch currency, policies only his party endorses.\n\nIn December, Wilders was convicted of inciting discrimination for leading supporters in a chant that they wanted \"Fewer! Fewer! Fewer!\" Moroccans in the country.\n\nA study published by the Social Affairs Ministry on Tuesday found that up to 40 percent of the Turks and Moroccans in the Netherlands do not feel they belong or are accepted.\n\nIf Wilders' PVV party finishes first but is unable to form a government, Rutte will be left trying to forge a centrist coalition with several parties that share little more than opposition to Wilders.\n\nIn that case \"we will stay put and manage the country until there is a new coalition,\" Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem said on Tuesday, quipping the situation could persist for \"years\" under the constitution.\n\nThe Netherlands, a country of 17 million that relies heavily on foreign trade, in 2005 rejected the European constitution and last year voted down a treaty for closer EU ties with Ukraine.\n\nA poll by Motivaction on Tuesday showed more than 61 percent of respondents see Dutch politicians as \"elitist, unreliable and dishonest.\"\n\nAround 37 percent of likely voters said they hadn't decided who to vote for.\n\n\"I find it difficult to make a decision,\" said Renee Keijzer, from the town of Volendam. \"So much has happened in the world that it is hard to position yourself properly.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Stephanie van den Berg; Editing by Anthony Deutsch and Janet Lawrence)"}
{"text": "Who Stands Where In A Crowded Elevator And Why?\n\nShe's in Finland now, getting her Ph.D. at the University of Jyvaskyla, but before that, when she was in Adelaide, Australia, she studied elevator behavior. Rebekah Rousi hung around two tall office towers in town, riding elevators up and down day after day, looking for patterns. When a bunch of people get into an elevator, she wondered, do they segregate in any predictable way? Do tall ones stand in the back? Do men stand in different places than women? Who looks where? She says she wasn't expecting or even predicting a particular configuration, but she found one.\n\nOver and over, she noticed that older \"more senior men in particular seem to direct themselves towards the back of the elevator cabins.\"\n\nYounger men took up the middle ground.\n\nAnd in the front, facing the doors, backs to the guys, stood \"women of all ages.\"\n\nShe's not sure why. It wasn't segregation by height. It wasn't age, since older and younger women co-mingled. Clearly, the people in the back had the advantage of seeing everybody in the cabin, while people in the front had no idea who was behind them. Could there be a curiosity difference? A predatory difference?\n\nThere was a second pattern, one that broke along gender lines. \"Men,\" she wrote, \"looked in the side mirrors and the door mirrors\" to openly check out the other passengers, and/or themselves.\n\nWomen didn't do that. \"Women would watch the monitors and avoid eye contact with other users (unless in conversation).\" They would only look at the mirrors (where they could check out the other passengers) when they were with other women. Eye-wise, the guys were roving, the ladies weren't.\n\n\"That's where I started thinking of power,\" Rebekah wrote me. The men who flocked to the back, who had a better view of their fellow passengers, were consistently older, more \"senior\" (I'm not sure how she knew that, but it's in her posted paper) and many of them \"weren't concerned with 'getting caught' looking in the mirror.\" They gazed freely, suggesting a sense of privilege. Younger, less powerful men seemed to avoid that space, choosing a middle ground. The back of the box, (unlike the back of the bus in Alabama civil rights days) she decided, might be the elevator power zone.\n\nOr ...\n\nPerhaps a gender analysis is too easy. Power hierarchies in elevators, she wrote, \"almost seemed too cliché.\" This could be about shyness. Bold people choose the back; shy people the front. Does that mean she thinks Australian women are more self-conscious than Australian men? She wouldn't go there, except to say, \"I don't really want people to know how vain I am, so looking in the mirror (as a woman or not) when others are in the lift ... is highly avoided.\" By this analysis, the back of the elevator is the Vanity-Unleashed zone.\n\nBasically, she's still puzzled. A pattern shows up. But the explanation, she said, slipping into academic shyness, \"awaits further analysis.\" Then she added, \"I'd be really interested to hear what your listeners (she means you, you reading this) have to say about the issue.\"\n\nThe always mischievous Latif Nasser (who is, I should mention, a regular contributor to Radiolab) read this post and sent me a video that describes a very different kind of elevator behavior. What happens if you step inside and everybody around you is doing something odd? Do you do it too?"}
{"text": "TEL AVIV — The New York Times and other news media outlets find it newsworthy that a top U.S. military commander, when asked a far-fetched hypothetical question about a nuclear strike on China, replied that he would comply with an order on the matter if it came from President Donald Trump.\n\n\"What if Trump Ordered a Nuclear Strike on China? I'd Comply, Says Admiral,\" was the title of a highly-cited New York Times article.\n\nThe newspaper was reporting on a comment made by Adm. Scott H. Swift, commander of the United States Pacific Fleet, who was asked at a security conference in Australia on Thursday whether he would hypothetically comply with an order from Trump to carry out a nuclear strike on China.\n\n\"The answer would be yes,\" Swift replied to the generalized hypothetical.\n\nSwift explained the chain of command in the U.S. military: \"Every member of the U.S. military has sworn an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic and to obey the officers and the president of the United States as the commander in chief appointed over us.\"\n\nSwift further asserted that, \"Any time you have a military that is moving away from a focus, and an allegiance, to civilian control, then we really have significant problems.\"\n\nHe added that the proper chain of command serves as the \"core to the American democracy,\" according to a recording obtained by Reuters.\n\nCapt. Charlie Brown, explained that the topic of using nuclear weapons on China was \"ridiculous,\" and that Swift was simply responding to an \"outrageous hypothetical\" question posed to him.\n\n\"Frankly, the premise of the question was ridiculous,\" Brown said. \"It was posed as an outrageous hypothetical, but the admiral simply took it as an opportunity to say the fact is that we have civilian control of the military and we abide by that principle.\"\n\nReuters reported on the comments in a story titled, \"Hypothetically speaking, U.S. Admiral says ready for nuclear strike on China if Trump so ordered.\"\n\n\"U.S. Pacific Fleet commander: I'd launch nuclear strike against China if Trump ordered it,\" was the title of a USA Today piece.\n\n\"US admiral ready for nuclear attack on China if ordered by Donald Trump,\" reads a Sky News online headline.\n\nNewsweek ran a story titled, \"'If Trump Asked, We'd Nuke China Next Week,' Says U.S. Navy Fleet Commander.\"\n\nThe news media coverage of a top military commander saying he would obey a military order from Trump comes after former CIA Director John Brennan suggested at a conference two weeks ago that top Trump officials should refuse to carry out an order if the president decided to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n\n\"I think it's the obligation of some executive branch officials to refuse to carry that out,\" Brennan said at the Aspen Institute's Security Forum.\n\nAt the same conference, Evelyn Farkas, a former top Obama administration Defense Department official, advocated for the intelligence community to consider compromising sources and methods when it comes to \"saving American democracy,\" as Breitbart News was first to report.\n\n\"And I know that we have to preserve our sources and methods,\" Farkas said, speaking about the U.S. intelligence community. \"But at some point you know, sometimes maybe you have to actually compromise some kind of source or method if it comes down to saving American democracy.\"\n\nAaron Klein is Breitbart's Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

{"text": "Some rape victims have a \"moral responsibility\" for their fate, a leading barrister has suggested.\n\nBarbara Hewson, a human rights and civil liberties lawyer, made the comments as she attacked the \"ideology of sexual victimisation\" which she said has come to dominate discussion of rape.\n\nShe also expressed doubts over the \"long term damaging effects\" of rape and criticised the view that the offence was \"morally absolutely unambiguous\" with the victim \"utterly innocent\" and the \"victimiser ... utterly guilty\".\n\nMiss Hewson made her outspoken comments in a debate on the subject at the LSE earlier this week, saying: \"We need to make a distinction between legal responsibility and moral responsibility.\n\n\"The law does not attribute any responsibility now to the victim of rape whereas traditionally we know the judge would say when they came to sentence 'well she was contributorally (sic) negligent' or something like that.\"\n\nMiss Hewson, a barrister at Hardwicke Chambers, added: \"It seems to me, simply factually, we all know if you're drunk you are more likely to have accidents. So if you fall off a bar stool and hit you head and have a serous brain injury because you're drunk people are gong to say well you chose to be drunk.\n\n\"So it does seem to me something a little sanitised about the idea that (when discussing rape) we cannot even have a discussion about the moral responsibility whatever people may want to say about the legal responsibility.\"\n\nMiss Hewson, 52, who lives in Islington, north London, dismissed what she saw as four \"components\" of the dominant \"ideology of sexual victimisation\" surrounding rape.\n\n\"The first is the idea that rape and sexual abuse is very widespread but largely unrecognised even by victims themselves who need to be taught to realise what's really happened.\n\n\"Secondly, that it has long term damaging effects. Thirdly that its morally absolutely unambiguous, the victim is utterly innocent and the victimiser is utterly guilty and this is infinitesimal. And finally that claims of victimisation must always be respected, anything less is victim-blaming.\"\n\nShe said some rape victims spent too much time blaming failings in their personal and professional lives on their ordeals, adding: \"It becomes the cause of everything that goes wrong in life.\"\n\nHer intervention has been strongly condemned by rape charities. Fiona Elvines, from Rape Crisis, said: \"Barbara Hewson shows how out of touch she is with the realities of sexual violence. As a society, we have moved on from the rape myths she continues to propagate.\"\n\nHer comments come at a time of intense debate over the prosecution of sex offence cases and the treatment of victims in court.\n\nIn February this year, Frances Andrade, 48, killed herself shortly after giving evidence against a couple accused of sexually abusing her as a youngster.\n\nHer husband said she had been \"incensed\" by the questioning of her by the prosecution.\n\nIn August, Robert Colover, a prosecution barrister, faced criticism after he described a 13-year-old victim as \"predatory\".\n\nAnd it is not the first time that Miss Hewson has courted controversy on the issue.\n\nThe University of Cambridge graduate attacked the decision to double the sentence for Stuart Hall, the broadcaster, following his conviction, after he admitted 14 counts of indecent against girls aged from nine to 17 between 1967 and 1985\n\nMr Hall's original sentence of 15 months was doubled to 30 months after public outrage over the perceived leniency of the initial decision.\n\nMiss Hewson has also previously called for the age of consent to be lowered to 13 and criticised the \"witch-hunt\" of ageing celebrities accused of sexual abuse."}

{"text": "WASHINGTON -- New documents reveal that a high-ranking official in the administration of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) knew that Fort Lee, N.J., had issues with traffic congestion around the George Washington Bridge, long before he authorized a seemingly unnecessary study that closed down lanes to the bridge and made traffic even worse.\n\nFort Lee is an essential access point to New York City, serving as the gateway to the George Washington Bridge, which is the busiest bridge in the United States. In November 2010, Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich (D) wrote to Bill Baroni, deputy director of the Port Authority of New York and Jersey, and complained of traffic problems in the borough. The letter was obtained by The Record in a public records request.\n\n\"On approximately 20 occasions in the last forty days, our Borough has been completely gridlocked,\" wrote Sokolich to Baroni, who was Christie's top official at the Port Authority. \"Traveling from the south to the north end of our Borough takes upwards of one hour. Our safety vehicles are unable to traverse our own thoroughfares to attend to emergencies which place our residents in harms way.\"\n\nDespite these concerns, on Sept. 9, 2013, Sokolich woke up to find that two of the three local access lanes to the George Washington Bridge had been closed, causing dangerous traffic jams in the borough on the first day of school. Neither he nor Port Authority Executive Director Patrick Foye -- who was appointed by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) -- were given any advance warning.\n\nThe closures were ordered by David Wildstein, then the director of interstate capital projects and an ally of Christie's. They came just weeks after Sokolich refused to endorse Christie's reelection bid. On Sept. 12, Sokolich said he believed the closures were \"punitive,\" although he later backed off that accusation.\n\nBaroni has stated that the closures were part of a traffic study, implying that Fort Lee may not need three access lanes.\n\n\"Every one of you, every one of you on this committee has people in your communities who sit in longer traffic every day because of the special lanes for Fort Lee,\" Baroni said in November.\n\nBut he acknowledged that no one ever sought approval for the study, which, without an alternative route, was guaranteed to create traffic congestion.\n\nAccording to The Record, a bridge official said Wildstein also specifically instructed him to keep the lane closures secret from Fort Lee officials. And records indicate, according to the paper, \"that traffic engineers predicted it would lead to 600-vehicle back-ups during the morning rush hour that would not subside until noon.\"\n\nWildstein and Baroni have since resigned and hired attorneys to represent them.\n\nIn a Dec. 17 press conference on the controversy, Christie stood by Baroni's explanation for the closures, saying that while his appointees did not go through the proper channels for the closures, there was no malicious or political intent in what they did.\n\nStill, the controversy has continued to dog Christie, who is considered a possible 2016 presidential contender. Sen. John \"Jay\" Rockefeller (D-W.Va.), chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, has asked the Transportation Department to review what happened in Fort Lee.\n\n\"While this type of decision tends to be local in nature, I am concerned about the larger federal implications of what appears to be political appointees abusing their power to hamper interstate commerce and safety without public notice,\" wrote Rockefeller in his letter to Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx.\n\nThe inspector general of the Port Authority is also investigating the closures, and several state legislators continue to look into the matter.\n\nLast week, Christie said the controversy was \"not that big a deal\" even though reporters were \"obsessed\" with it."}
{"text": "Selection and storage\n\nJicamas can be available year around in the markets. Generally, they imported from central American countries through land route and flood the USA markets during spring and summer.\n\nChoose well-formed, firm, round, medium sized tubers. Avoid soft, shriveled, or tubers with surface cuts, cracks, and bruise skin.\n\nOnce at home, jicamas can be stored much like potatoes. They have good shelf life and keep well in a cool, dry, dark place for about 2-4 weeks. Exposure to a temperature below 10 °C results in chill-induced changes in color and texture. Also, prolong storage converts its starch into sugar, which makes the roots less sought after in savory dishes.\n\nCut sections, cubes or slices, however, should be placed inside the refrigerator.\n\nPreparation and serving methods\n\nWash in cool running water and dry mop just like in other tubers. Peel off the thick fibrous skin using a vegetable peeler or paring knife. Peel and other plant parts contain rotenone, an organic poison; and therefore, should be discarded. It then can be cut into cubes, sliced, or chopped into fine strips in a ways desired.\n\nFresh jicama is used much like a vegetable and is an important starch source in much of Central America. It stays crisp when cooked, making it one of the wonderful vegetable in stir-fries.\n\nHere are some serving tips:\n\nJicama salad.\n\nPhoto courtesy: Rex roof\n\nRaw jicama has sweet, succulent apple like fruity taste. In many parts of Mexico, fresh tubers are cut into cubes/sticks and sprinkled with lime juice, salt and dressed with olive oil and paprika or ground chili pepper and enjoyed!\n\nJicama is a favorite root vegetable in Mexican cooking where it is used in salads, slaw, stews, stir-fries, soups…etc. It mixes well with other common vegetables and fruits like orange, pineapple, carrot, green beans as well as with poultry, meat, and seafood.\n\nOutside of the American continent, this tuber is among the popular starch root in many south and the southeast region. In Malaysia, where it is known as bengkoang , fresh young tubers are sliced and eaten with other fruits like pineapple, apple, raw mango, sweet potato…etc, in rujak .\n\nIn Indonesia, they served with much like Malayan salad but with added rujak sauce made from palm sugar, tamarind, shrimp paste, chili peppers, and sautéed peanut paste. Also, as a rujak tumbuk , wherein all the ingredients mentioned above ground in a wooden mortar and served on a banana leaf.\n\nApart from salads, another popular oriental dish that uses jicama and turnips is popiah, a Fujian/Chaozhou-style fresh spring roll.\n\nSafety profile\n\nJicama plant contains significant levels of fat-soluble organic toxin, rotenone. This toxin is concentrated especially in the leaf tops, stems and seed pods but at much lower concentrations in the roots. Several studies found that it linked to the development of Parkinson's disease. However, peeled roots are safe for human consumption, including in children. Rotenone works at cellular level inhibiting several metabolic enzymes like NADH dehydrogenase in the mitochondria. Outside, it used as environmentally safe broad-spectrum insecticide, piscicide (to poison fish), and pesticide. (Medical disclaimer).\n\n<<-Back to Vegetables from Jicama nutrition.

{"text": "You've successfully decluttered your living space. There's no junk, cruft, kipple, or unloved things to be seen. It was a lot of physical work with several emotional moments, and perhaps a tussle with your partner or housemates. But wow, do you feel good. Lighter. Free from the weight of your possessions. Ready to do anything.\n\nAnd now what? Where do you go from here? I've been through three different but interconnecting phases after decluttering. Let me share my insights.\n\nMaintenance\n\nIn order to keep your space looking great, you'll need to keep up the decluttering vibe. You'll set some rules for yourself and carefully follow them. Whether you follow a 10 minute-a-day decluttering schedule or a one-in-one-out policy, you've got to maintain your lovely habitat.\n\nBut when your focus relaxes from its razor-sharp incisions into your belongings and there's not so much to declutter anymore, it's easy to let the maintenance phase drift away as you put your attention on other things. That's when you'll hit the next phase.\n\nRecluttering\n\nIt may start with a practical and fully reasonable excuse: you decluttered something you needed after all, so now you have to repurchase the (insert item here). In my case, it was an old fashioned, crank-handle food mill. I owned it for 12 years and used it once a year. I figured it was safe to declutter but nothing substitutes for it. Now I have a new food mill that I will use once a year.\n\nFrom those practical repurchases, it is a slippery slope to buying other things, and to taking freebies and promotional items. Your one-in-one-out system slides a bit, then fully collapses. Before you know it your \"hot spot\" is strewn with stuff and you're on the way to a new collection of all those doodads that you eliminated a few months back.\n\nThe recluttering phase can last a long time. Consumer culture is the norm for many of us and it doesn't seem out of place to go to the mall for fun and to buy stuff impulsively. But if you enjoyed positive effects from being decluttered, eventually you'll realise what is happening and you'll start decluttering again.\n\nAnti-consumerism\n\nWhen you catch yourself in the act of mindless recluttering, you will probably start decluttering again. At the same time you may experience a strong backlash of anti-consumerism. \"How dare those big corporations do this to me? Why is my life all based on owning things? I refuse to be manipulated by their marketing!\"\n\nThis is a step beyond decluttering and it can be a potent lifestyle change.\n\nAnti-consumerism twists around how you interact with stuff. Shopping may disgust you. Being in malls or mega-stores will be difficult. Seeing people buying things to feed their egos will cause you grief. You're going to have a period of seriously negative judgement about people. It will pass but it is powerful. Be careful to express it gently, if you express it at all.\n\nYou'll stop shopping for recreation and spend your time and money differently. Your priorities will change and experiences will trump objects. You'll buy stuff only when you can't find a reasonable substitute among your inventory. When you do purchase, you'll do it with a new perspective – how can it be reused and how will you eventually get rid of it? You'll get creative and crafty with repurposing things.\n\nIn fact, you may even go as far as regretting your decluttering. All that stuff you got rid of, what a waste. You could have used those extra tea towels to make potholders."}
{"text": "City of Thieves aired on May 24, 2010.  It was boarded by Sean Jimenez and Bert Youn, who as a team had boarded Tree Trunks, Ricardio the Heart Guy, Memories of Boom Boom Mountain, and Evicted.  Bert Youn also co-boarded Wizard. What's interesting about City of Thieves is how similar it is in general outline to Memories of Boom Boom Mountain.  Both stories involve Finn being faced with an impossible problem that pushes him to the very edge of his heroism.  In Memories of Boom Boom Mountain, it's the irreconcilable desires of all sentient beings; in City of Thieves, it's the moral erosion caused by the toxic environment of the city itself, resulting in Finn losing his so-called \"purity.\" That's not the only difference.  MBBM was, despite pushing Finn pretty far, a relatively upbeat and positive episode in which all the characters were decent people.  City of Thieves has a grimy, unpleasant demeanor which overwhelm's Finn's desire to do good.  This is evident from the color palette of the episode:\nThe episode is awash with earth tones and appears to have poor lighting.  The houses are jumbled up and chaotically placed.  This air of confusion and griminess becomes increasingly apparent as Finn and Jake also get dirtier and dirtier throughout the episode to go along with their apparent corruption. The nature of Finn and Jake's corruption is very interesting.  Jake is corrupted much more easily than Finn; ultimately, a pair of bright red boots is all that is needed to tempt Jake into a life of crime, although he appears to be unaware of stealing them. In this way, Jake is brought down by the city much more than Finn (who we'll discuss later) is.  Jake essentially becomes a typical denizen of the city, stealing whatever takes his fancy.  The primary visual focus in this episode is, like in MBMM, Rube Goldberg-like: the chains of theft, making it clear that nobody is innocent in this city.  It also provides a lot of excellent opportunities for more bizarre and grotesque character design than the typical, more positive Adventure Time setting. Finn's corruption is much more complex and nuanced.  It comes out of trusting Penny, a pitiable orphan girl who instructs Finn to take a treasure chest that she claims contains her lost flower basket.  However, it transpires that she tricked Finn into stealing the treasure chest so she could have the gold, thus turning Finn into a thief. This is an interesting ethical principle for Finn to live by.  He judges himself not by his intentions, which were undeniably good, but by the actions he takes.  This is emphasized by his inability to pass through a thief-proof force field, which causes Finn to rethink his own identity as a thief. Finally, Finn and Jake unite in their corruption.  Having been crushed by the nature of the city, they take a surprisingly nihilistic stance in their resolve to take vengeance on Penny, resulting in a spree of thefts and a late-night confrontation. Here is where things veer back into normal Adventure Time territory.  Being the type of show we've established that Adventure Time is in season 1, the show needs to reset the status quo, which it does by having Finn and Jake scrub down Penny with soap in an attempt to wash the city's grime and villainy off of her.  In so doing, they end up washing themselves and declare themselves newly pure. However, the episode has one last interesting twist in that Penny is not actually redeemed by the soap, as she steals Finn's clothes.  The redemption only exists in Finn and Jake's heads, just as their corruption was purely psychological as well.

See what it takes to visit 55 countries and 5 continents in a '89 Vanagon.\n\nCan you describe your journey for those who did not follow you in the last 5 years ?\n\nWe are Karol \"Charlie\" Lewandowski and Aleksandra Ślusarczyk, and we are young travel bloggers from Poland, authors of Bus Around The World blog, who did not have a lot of money but wanted to see the world.\n\nWe bought an old van for $600 an painted it. We brought our tent, food and just took off. In 6 years we visited more than 50 countries and we traveled more than 100,000 miles on 5 continents. So far we never paid for accommodations and we almost always cooked our own meals.\n\nOur car broke down at least 50 times, but we learned how to repair it during the trip. Followers from our blog helped us along the way and people even supported fuel costs. It feels like people from all over the world traveled with us!\n\nFor the past 6 years we showed through our blog that even with limited budget it is possible to make dreams come true. Our blog is very popular among young people – we have over 80,000 fans on Facebook. Our blog has been voted Best Blog of the Year in 2014 in Poland, and we appeared on major TV stations! We wrote two books about our trips (in Polish) – Bus Around The World. The first expedition and Bus Around The World. America for $8.\n\nWhat is your bus ? Tell us more about it, did you restore some parts yourself?\n\nWe are traveling in a '89 Vanagon T3. We have our own electric shower, bed, kitchen, 220V power converter and pretty much everything we need!\n\nWith over 50 breakdowns with the bus, would you say you're a good mechanic now? And could you tell us about the worst breakdown you had and how you've been able to keep going?\n\nWhen we started traveling I didn't know much about mechanic. Now I can fix most things in our freedom vessel, but with a different car it would probably be a different story! In our van probably everything broke down so I know everything about it. One of our worst breakdown was when we had to change the engine in Norway without any access to a garage! But THE worst breakdown occurred in Australia when we lost a wheel. We got stuck in the middle of the desert (obviously our phones would not work), hundreds of kilometers from civilization and with limited water supplies. It's hard to drive a car without a wheel but we were able to move very slowly – somebody had to run next to the wheel and hit it with a stick!\n\nHow many countries total did you visit ? How many with your van ?\n\nWe visited about 55 countries, 52 with our van. We shipped the van from Australia to the United States. When we couldn't use the van because transportation was too expensive, we hitchhiked and used local transportation or hire another camper (as we did for example in New Zealand).\n\nCan you give us a unusual tip to travel cheap with a van?\n\nIt depends where you are traveling. In Australia it is a good idea to install WikiCamps app to find free campsites. With the same app in Ukraine and Romania you can ask people if you can park in their driveway! People are very friendly over there and will almost always invite you into their home and tell you amazing stories.\n\nWhich countries were your favorite to explore with a van ?\n\nAustralia for their free campsites, beautiful nature, free electric grills and cheap kangaroo meat! It is a paradise for people who want to travel cheaply with a van 🙂\n\nFollow Karol and Aleksandra here:"}
{"text": "It's hard to understand the pain that comes with trying to get pregnant and it not working. Or trying to get pregnant, only to get the positive test and lose the baby before you got too far into it. Infertility sucks. Plain and simple and when you're struggling with infertility, one of the most challenging aspects is dealing with other women's pregnancy. It's incredibly hard when a close friend or family member becomes pregnant, especially if it wasn't hard for her to conceive, and then to have to worry about why life isn't fair because you're still waiting, fighting, and hurting.\n\nThe feelings are complicated because you're happy for your friend, because pregnancy news is often really happy news, but you're also hurting for you. Because for real, why isn't it always so 'easy'?\n\nIt sucks when you're struggling and it's hard to not fall down that \"why not me\" spiral that can suck you in when you're angry and frustrated. And then you feel bad that their happy news makes you angry. It's complicated, it's painful and it can ruin relationships.\n\nInfertility really took a toll on me. After 12 miscarriages, and 18+ months of trying to get pregnant with another child who I would be able to bring home, love on, and actually get to know, I was tired of it. I was done with the endless struggle and the last thing I wanted was to see another friend announce, go through the 9+ months and get to meet their baby … all while I was still in this hole that I couldn't get out of.\n\n{Also read: 3 Ways We Can Do Better for Our Friend Who Had a Miscarriage}\n\nPregnancy announcements from others and infertility don't mix, to put it lightly. It's like oil and water, but with more complications because all our lives we're told to be a good friend, we have to put aside our own feelings, but that's not easy — nor should it be required — when you're in this dynamic.\n\nWhen you're struggling with infertility and not able to avoid pregnancy announcements, there are some ways you can both guard your heart from the pain and sorrow, and help to preserve relationships that are important to you. It starts with allowing yourself to feel what you need to feel — the good, bad, angry, ugly, complicated, and everywhere in between.\n\nLet me remind you that you should not feel guilt over your legitimate feelings. You're allowed to feel the complications, the pain, the ANGER, the frustration, and you should be kind to yourself and give you that space.\n\nYou can also set up boundaries with your pregnant friend, immediately, so you can give yourself that comfort and self-care that you need.\n\nYou might not want to listen to them talk about how easy it was to get pregnant or if they're still making a decision on whether they're going to keep the baby. Maybe you don't want to listen to them complain about feeling sick or pregnancy aches and pains. Even if you just don't have it in you emotionally right now, you're allowed that space.\n\nOr if you need to take a \"break\" from them for a while, that's allowed, too.\n\nIt is OK and healthy to put those boundaries up with your friend and they should respect it. You can choose when or if you want to be involved in their life while they're pregnant and hopefully at the same time you'll have a group of people around you who will support you, and love you through infertility.\n\nDo you have any advice for a friend who is battling infertility and they're facing some pregnancy news that aches, even though they're happy? Let us know in the comments.\n\nAlso read:\n\n(Image: iStock / KatarzynaBialasiewicz)"}
{"text": "OTTAWA — The Ontario government is disputing NDP Leader Tom Mulcair's assertion that the country's largest province supports his plan to create one million $15-a-day child-care spaces.\n\nOntario's education minister, Liz Sandals, says the province welcomes new investments and interest from \"all federal partners\" on child care.\n\nBut she said Mulcair has not provided sufficient details of his plan — which would require provinces to pick up 40 per cent of the tab — to determine whether Ontario would be prepared to buy in.\n\nThe NDP is proposing to create one million child-care spaces over eight years that would be accessible to parents for $15 a day, regardless of income. The federal government would pick up 60 per cent of the cost, which the NDP estimates would cost the federal treasury $5 billion annually once fully implemented.\n\nThe NDP says Manitoba, British Columbia and New Brunswick have signalled a willingness to negotiate a shared-cost child-care program.\n\nHowever, Sandals said Ontario has already spent billions on child care and full-day kindergarten and those investments would have to be recognized \"in full\" in any national program requiring matching provincial funds.\n\nIf Ontario and other provinces were to insist that money already being spent on child care be counted as part of their matching share of a national program, that could significantly reduce the number of new spaces Mulcair is promising to create.\n\nOntario's view of the NDP child-care proposal was thrown into question Saturday after Liberal MP John McCallum predicted Mulcair's plan will never materialize because provinces don't have the money to contribute their share of the program, which he pegged at $3.3 billion.\n\n\"Where are the provinces going to come up with $3.3 billion? I come from Ontario. Ontario has a significant deficit. Ontario would have to come up with a billion dollars-plus per year,\" McCallum told a news conference.\n\n\"If the provinces don't come up with the money, there won't be any child-care spaces.\"\n\nWynne, who has been actively campaigning for Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau in the federal campaign, signed onto a letter from all premiers to Prime Minister Stephen Harper just last month, in which the provincial leaders called for federal \"supports to families such as affordable, quality childcare.\"\n\nMoreover, Wynne's Liberals supported an NDP motion in the Ontario legislature last fall calling on the province to \"partner with the federal government to ensure every parent in Ontario has access to child care at a cost of no more than $15 a day per child.\"\n\nBut Sandals said that motion included no specific details on how such a program would be funded.\n\nShe said Ontario has gone from spending $530 million annually on child care to more than $1 billion while creating 130,000 new daycare spaces. Moreover, she said 470,000 children are benefiting from the provincial government's introduction of full-day kindergarten, without which every one of those children would need child care.\n\n\"We expect that any funding for child care that requires provincial matching would recognize these commitments in full,\" Sandals said.\n\nAsked whether Ontario might refuse to ante up any further funding on the basis that its existing investments already amount to its 40 per cent share of the NDP's proposed program, Sandals said: \"I cannot speak to specifics that haven't been shared in the NDP proposal.\"\n\nHowever, Mulcair might have no choice but to give Ontario, or any other province, its share of federal funding whether or not it puts up an additional dime of its own.\n\nUnder the NDP's 10-year-old policy on Quebec, known as the Sherbrooke declaration, the party has adopted the principle that provinces should be allowed to opt out of federal programs in areas of provincial jurisdiction — such as day care — with full compensation."}
{"text": "RALEIGH, N.C. -- An accreditation agency important to colleges receiving federal funds put the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on probation Thursday for a year over its academic fraud scandal.\n\nThe board of Southern Association of Colleges and Schools' Commission on Colleges stopped short of imposing the harshest penalty, which would have blocked the country's oldest public university from receiving federal funds including student loan proceeds.\n\nThe Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges gave UNC one year of probation as the result of its academic fraud scandal. Peyton Williams/Getty Images\n\nAt a meeting in Portsmouth, Virginia, the group determined that UNC-CH failed to comply with seven key operating principles for member universities, among them: integrity, program content, control of intercollegiate athletics and academic support services.\n\nThe practical effect of the sanction is that \"they just have to send us more documentation to show their compliance with seven of these principles,\" commission President Belle Wheelan said.\n\nThe agency previously opted against punishing UNC-CH, but acted after learning last fall of the scope of fake classes and artificially high grades in one academic department. A report revealed that the fake classes in the African studies department had gone on between 1993 and 2011. About half the 3,100 students who took the classes were athletes.\n\n\"Most of the students here aren't athletes and a lot of them go to class and work hard in class,\" senior psychology student Merrick Osborne said as he crossed the Chapel Hill campus Thursday. \"I think the biggest concern I would have is the probation would affect people who don't really have anything to do with the incidents.\"\n\nNew UNC-CH graduate James Draper said he believes his alma mater got off easy.\n\n\"This university did something wrong and we're being punished for it,\" said Draper, who now works as a biology research assistant.\n\nWheelan said board members stopped short of action that would mean the loss of federal funds in part because campus chancellor Carol Folt, who took over in 2013, and administrators she brought in hadn't been responsible for the festering problems.\n\nFolt's team \"had done a lot of work to clean up the problem,\" Wheelan said.\n\n\"But there's still these seven standards that the board felt they had not demonstrated compliance yet.\"\n\nFolt said in an interview that she never worried the university might lose accreditation or federal funds.\n\n\"I did not think that would be a fair resolution,\" Folt said. \"They're asking us to show continued progress on all the reforms that were put in place. So we presented two years of data on a number of things and they want to see a third year, and I understand that.\"\n\nA report in October by former U.S. Justice Department official Kenneth Wainstein found lecture classes that didn't meet and were treated as an independent study requiring a research paper or two. Wainstein's report also detailed how academic counselors enrolled athletes in those classes and how poor oversight throughout the university allowed the fraud to run unchecked for so long.\n\nWainstein was able to interview former department chairman Julius Nyang'oro and retired administrator Deborah Crowder. Neither had cooperated with earlier investigations but spoke to Wainstein after a state prosecutor agreed not to press charges.\n\nThe academic investigation grew out of a 2010 investigation into the school's football program.\n\nThe country's main college sports sanctioning body, the NCAA, last month accused UNC of failing to control its intercollegiate athletics program and four other severe violations, but didn't charge the school with academic fraud.\n\nNationwide, regional accrediting agencies placed 21 schools on probation and withdrew accreditation for 17 others around the country in 2014 and the first three months of this year, according to figures compiled by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation."}
{"text": "Muzaffar Salman / REUTERS A member of a rebel group called the Martyr Al-Abbas holds his weapon in a safe house in Aleppo June 11, 2013.\n\nAdministration officials told reporters Thursday that the CIA will covertly arm Syrian rebels in their fight against Bashar al Assad. Reports the Wall Street Journal:\n\nU.S. officials said the administration faced little choice other than to step up its support or risk watching as rebels lose still more ground to a resurgent Assad regime backed by Russia, Iran and soldiers from the militant Hezbollah group.\n\nThat makes sense. The U.S. doesn't like Hezbollah or Iran, and it certainly doesn't want the Assad regime to win the war. Washington's also not crazy about Russia's foreign policy in the Middle East. But the administration is not going to give the rebels enough to do much more than keep fighting. Reports the New York Times:\n\nThe officials held out the possibility that the assistance, coordinated by the Central Intelligence Agency, could include antitank weapons, but they said that for now supplying the antiaircraft weapons that rebel commanders have said they sorely need is not under consideration.\n\nThat makes sense too. Obama may want to keep the opposition alive, but it would be dangerous to give them weapons that could be used to take down passenger planes since the rebels are deeply intertwined with jihadist factions, including one, Jabhat al-Nusra, the administration listed as an al Qaeda ally last December.\n\nThe administration declared it was taking this latest Syrian half-step because America's spies had concluded that Assad had used chemical weapons. \"The intelligence community estimates that 100 to 150 people have died from detected chemical weapons attacks in Syria to date,\" deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes told reporters Thursday. Said Rhodes, Obama \"has said that the use of chemical weapons would change his calculus, and it has.\"\n\nBut there could be another reason for doing just enough to keep the two sides fighting. The Assad regime is increasingly relying on Hezbollah to fight throughout the country. The rebels for their part are relying on jihadist and al Qaeda allies to fight back. Keeping two of the United States' most active terrorist enemies fighting each other might be seen in some circles as not such a bad thing.\n\nSuch a realpolitik approach could carry dangers, though. Advocates of robust intervention, like John McCain and Lindsey Graham, have said that allowing the war to continue could dangerously threaten U.S. interests by spilling over into neighboring allied countries, like Jordan and Turkey. \"This is a regional conflict,\" McCain said Thursday, \"Jordan is destabilized. Lebanon is about to erupt into sectarian violence. Jihadists are flowing in from all over the Middle East. This is erupting into a regional conflict where the United States' vital national security interests are at stake.\" McCain advocates establishing a no-fly zone.\n\nAllowing the bloodshed to continue also would cut against the declared policy of the administration and the humanitarian leanings of Obama's incoming National Security Advisor, Susan Rice, and his nominee to be U.N. Ambassador, Samantha Power. In theory, they all want to diminish civilian deaths and end the war diplomatically. \"The United States is providing $515 million in humanitarian assistance for the Syrian crisis and seeking to rally others to provide more as well,\" Rhodes said Thursday.\n\nPerhaps the U.S. will prevent further civilian deaths and hasten the war's end by declaring it is acting in response to the use of chemical weapons and by taking limited measures to counter Assad's progress. But sometimes to see the true goals of a country's diplomacy, it's best to look at the effects of what its leaders do rather than the things they say.\n\nWith reporting by Zeke Miller and Jay Newton-Small\n\nMORE: The Fall of al-Qusayr: Capture of Strategic Syrian Town Marks a New Phase in the War"}
{"text": "The ACLU today submitted a request to the Department of Justice and the FBI asking for the release of all documents relating to President Donald Trump's decision to remove FBI Director James Comey from office. The cloud of uncertainty swirling over Comey's dismissal, along with indications that the president may have gravely abused his power, demands a public accounting.\n\nDEMAND A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR ON RUSSIA\n\nAt the time of his dismissal, FBI Director Comey was responsible for overseeing an ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election and possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and the Russian government. According to initial White House statements — by most accounts hastily assembled with little coordination — the president dismissed Comey on the recommendation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. The two, we learned, had prepared a pair of memoranda asserting that Comey had mishandled the investigation of Hillary Clinton's private email server and had violated Department of Justice policies when he publicly announced the results of that investigation. (This, despite the fact that both Sessions and Trump had previously lauded Comey's handling of that investigation.)\n\nSubsequent reports indicate that the president had already decided to fire Comey — among other reasons, for being insufficiently loyal to the president — and that he sought the help of Sessions and Rosenstein to justify his decision. Several days after the dismissal, the president said in an interview that he fired Comey because \"he's a showboat, he's a grandstander.\" President Trump also stated that he had the Russia investigation in mind when he fired Mr. Comey, and media accounts indicate that Mr. Comey had requested additional resources for the FBI's investigation in the days before he was dismissed. In other words, the White House's explanations for firing Comey shifted significantly over a matter of days, and the public doesn't know the actual basis for the decision.\n\nAs the nation's predominant law enforcement agency, the FBI's impact on American justice can't be overstated. Our history offers important lessons into why the FBI director role needs to be insulated from political interference. In response to both Watergate and a litany of abuses wrought by J. Edgar Hoover's five-decade tenure as FBI director, Congress established a 10-year term meant to both check the director's power and insulate the position from party politics. The FBI plays a central role in defending the rule of law, conducting domestic law enforcement investigations, and protecting against civil rights and civil liberties violations. As a result, the agency has tremendous power to affect the lives of ordinary people — for good or ill. Its use of those powers should not be affected by political interests.\n\nThe president's actions and shifting justifications threaten the rule of law. As both Trump and his deputy press secretary suggested, by firing Mr. Comey, Trump sought to hasten an end to the FBI's ongoing investigation into his own campaign. But the rule of law requires that investigators and prosecutors have the independence to follow the facts wherever they lead — even if they lead to the president's door. It is a firmly rooted tradition in our democracy that the president does not interfere with individual criminal investigations — let alone those that implicate the president's own interests or the interests of his family, friends, or political associates.\n\nTo intervene in such an investigation, or to obstruct its progress, threatens to place the president above the law. It would subvert our system of justice, which requires the FBI and Department of Justice to hold even the most powerful to account. For these reasons, the ACLU has called for the appointment of a special prosecutor and the establishment of a select committee to investigate the Trump campaign's ties to Russian interference. We have also called for the acting FBI director to permanently lead the Russia investigation. At this stage, this is the best way to ensure the investigation's independence.\n\nMeanwhile, we cannot afford to be kept in the dark on the president's actual reasons for firing the FBI director."}
{"text": "This weekend our starstruck hometown of Indianapolis hosted the 47th edition of Gen Con, one of America's oldest and largest gaming conventions. Whether your gaming mode is RPGs, tabletop games, TCGs, dice games, family board games, or video games, Gen Con has its sights aimed in your direction. Try a new game, pick up supplies for your current campaigns, network with gamers from faraway lands, or just wander the premises and gaze upon the wonders. Attendance in 2013 exceeded 49,000, an impressive 20% increase over 2012. Judging by how overcrowded the main exhibit hall became by mid-afternoon Saturday this year, I'd say they're on target for another increase.\n\nThis was my fifth GenCon and my wife's fourth, even though we're not certified pro gamers. Some of our personal geek interests intersect with enough of the available exhibits, dealers, and special events that we're rarely bored except in the occasional line, but those come with the territory. I have somewhat obsolete working knowledge of the early days of gaming. In my youth I used to spend dollar after dollar on the original Advanced Dungeons and Dragons hardcovers and modules, as well as various other TSR RPGs (Top Secret!, Star Frontiers, Marvel Super-Heroes, et al.) and a subscription to both Dragon Magazine and Dungeon Adventures (starting with issue #1!) until all my childhood friends moved away and took their Player Characters with them.\n\nAnyway: we took too many photos because too many people did interesting things. Our photos will be paced out in a six-part series that I hope to post on a slightly-more-than-daily basis over the next few days, Lord willing and if non-internet responsibilities don't interfere. We begin with the easiest place to start: the winners of the 29th annual Gen Con Costume Contest.\n\nCaveat for newcomers to MCC: some of our photos aren't the greatest ever. The 500 Ballroom is poorly lit at all times whether any conventions are using it or not. Flash photography was forbidden, which is just as well because using the flash from the non-Press-Pass, non-VIP seats produces even worse results. This is something my wife and I enjoy doing, to show our appreciation and awe for those with the flair for this particular aspect of the scene. We apologize in advance for the costumes we missed, and for the opportunities we blew because of our limitations and hindrances.\n\nComments and especially corrections are always welcome and appreciated. (That's my standing policy for every MCC entry anyway, not just the Gen Con six-parter.) I'm not plugged directly into every single geek scene out there. Very few geeks are, even the famous ones with their own YouTube channels. If you notice any wanton acts of mislabeling, please don't hesitate to call me out. I enjoy learning about new worlds and universes, giving credit where it's due, and dispelling my old man's ignorance.\n\nOnward:\n\nListed for the sake of completeness are the other winners in these categories who successfully evaded our cameras.

{"text": "After starting the past two games for the New England Patriots, backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo has been creating a lot of headlines for himself around the league.\n\nWithin the two games that he has played, rumors have been tossed around that the team should trade Garoppolo when Tom Brady comes back, due to his high trade value and his performance. The question on a lot of people's mind is whether the team should trade or keep Garoppolo.\n\nIn two games this season, Garoppolo has thrown for 498 yards, 4 touchdowns and 1 interception, with a passer rating of 117.2. The reason for Garoppolo starting the first two games is due to Brady being suspended for the first four games of the season for what is known as \"deflategate\".\n\nIn his first start of the season vs the Arizona Cardinals, he looked great with his throws, driving the team down the field, helping them win 23-21. He threw for 264 yards, 1 touchdown and 0 interceptions, with a passer rating of 73.0. He did showcase some flaws as well, but that is expected for your first start.\n\nIn his second start of the season vs the Miami Dolphins, Garoppolo looked phenomenal. He was making great passes down the field, looked poised in the pocket, and showcased his arm strength. Before getting injured near the end of the first half, he threw for 234 yards, 3 touchdowns and 0 interceptions, with a passer rating of 98.9.\n\nEven though we only saw a sample size of Garoppolo in only two starts in the league, he looked pretty good in those two starts.\n\nHe still needs to work on some stuff, but at the end of the day, Garoppolo has a bright future as a starting quarterback. He is a duel threat, and if he can not find a receiver open, he can run with the ball for a good chunk of yards.\n\nDespite the amazing numbers that Brady produces season after season, he does not have a lot of years left in the league, with him being 39-years old.\n\nThe team has to think of a backup plan for the future, and that is where Garoppolo comes in, as he showcased his potential in his first two starts in the league.\n\nTeams like the Cleveland Browns, Chicago Bears, and the San Fransisco 49ers will be interested in Garoppolo, due to the fact that these teams will be looking for a young quarterback that can lead the franchise and be the face of it.\n\nOut of all of these teams, the most interested team will most likely be Cleveland or Chicago, if they can get rid of Jay Cutler's contract somehow in the future.\n\nThe value will him for be draft picks, most likely first and second round picks. For a team like New England that has a quarterback that is in his prime and a quarterback that has a bright future as a starter, getting a high 1st round pick for the prospect would be fair value.\n\nGaroppolo would be a great choice to replace Brady when he hangs up his cleats, as he is still young (24) that he has a great career ahead of him.\n\nOut of himself and Jacoby Brissett, Garoppolo is the better quarterback, considering he can throw the ball more accurately, is better in the pocket, and he has a better arm as well. Both quarterbacks have good upside, but Garoppolo's upside is much better than Brissett.\n\nAt the end of the day, the team should listen to offers for him, but the team should not trade him, since he has got so much potential and can be a great quarterback to lead the team after Brady retires.\n\nPhoto Credit Maddie Meyer/Getty Images\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nGoogle"}

However, realising that the media was also scrutinizing the backlash, many of those who posted abusive tweets deleted them to destroy any evidence. The bullying wasn't limited to tweets though. A fake email account was created on her name and inappropriate emails were sent out from that account.\n\nDinakaran confess that she had never been subjected to hate in such a heinous manner and all the abuses and personal attack made her extremely paranoid. \"Sure, you might think they were empty threats, and I really had nothing to worry about. But did you forget about the episode where the two girls got arrested over an innocent Facebook status? I was paranoid,\" writes Dinakaran in her blog post.\n\n\"I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat. I didn't leave my house for a good ten days, I'm not even kidding you. My face was everywhere, and it only took one crazy person to act in a deranged manner to do something if I was easily recognizable in public. I wouldn't rest until my family was back home in the evenings. I was checking up with my friends (whose pictures with me were on Facebook) whether they were alright. I asked friends who were rallying with me on social media channels to stop doing so, in case they became victims of this callousness,\" she writes.\n\nDinakaran also says that she is not a SRK hater and the intention of her blog post wasn't to malign him, but to merely point out similarities. It's worth keeping in mind that the negativity of social media drove Shah Rukh Khan to delete his Twitter account at one point. \"Sad, i read so much judgements, jingoism, religious intolerance on the net & i use to think this platform wl change narrowmindedness, but no!\" Khan had written just before deleting his twitter account.\n\n\"Bullying's latest avatar is cyberbullying.\" Dinakaran points out on her blog. \"It's mind numbingly easy to form groups and target people on the internet and bully them mercilessly. It's a collective effort, yes, effort, and that means actual work that these bullies put in to intentionally hurt the victims. This includes anything and everything from spamming the user's walls, creating fake email ID's, harassing the user online, gathering information about them and try to use it against them.\" she adds.\n\nIn India, cyber bullying gets the necessary go-ahead from the absence of laws attuned to such cases. Most cases of online abuse are dealt by clubbing Section 66A with the Prohibition of Ragging Act (Section 509 of IPC), which is meant to tackle sexual harassment. Except for Section 66A of the IT Act, according to which a person can be booked for sending false, offensive messages through communication services, there is no strong law to tackle cases of online abuse.\n\nUpdated Date: Oct 25, 2013 17:24 PM"}
{"text": "By Evie Andreou\n\nTHE TRIAL of a Turkish Cypriot couple, charged for hanging the Cyprus Republic's flag outside their home and shop in June last year in Famagusta has been postponed until July 11.\n\nKoray Basdogrultmaci and Cinel Senem Husseyin were charged with offences against public order.\n\nThe couple was arrested and jailed even though they had tried to explain to the Turkish Cypriot police that Basdogrultmaci, who was arrested four years ago for the same reason, had been acquitted in court.\n\nThe couple said hanging the flag was their way of protesting the Turkish Prime Minister's hypocrisy. Tayyip Erdogan had, the previous day attended the opening ceremony of the Mediterranean Games in Mersin, in Turkey where the Cypriot flag had flown unimpeded.\n\nThe Turkish Cypriot couple protested that the Cypriot flag could wave in Turkey but not in northern Cyprus.\n\nThe trial has been postponed several times already. At the April 9, 2014 hearing, which was postponed because the judge who was to hear the case was on maternity leave, the couple was asked to show remorse and be fined but they refused.\n\nThe next hearing was set for May 6 and the couple was warned that they would risk be heavily fined and even incarcerated but the trial was postponed because \"the police witnesses were not in court\" the Cyprus Mail was told by Tina Adamidou, a personal friend of the couple. \"I wonder what the next excuse will be\" said Adamidou who believes that they have no real reason to proceed with the case and that's why it is being constantly postponed.\n\nThe couple who prefer to call themselves 'Turkish-speaking Cypriots', declared they'd rather go to prison than pay any fine and that in such a case they would file a case at the European Court of Human Rights.\n\n\"The couple is being victimised for their beliefs and they are standing proud stating they are willing to go to jail to protect their basic human right, freedom of expression,\" said Adamidou who said the case has already been reported to Amnesty International.\n\n\"There are no laws pertaining to flying the Cypriot flag, so the trumped-up charges of 'disturbing the peace' are the charges that this couple will have to face,\" she said.\n\nAccording to the couple's information the complaint had come from five mainland Turks because they did not want the Cyprus flag hanging opposite their workshop.\n\n\"If that's the case then why didn't the breakaway regime's policemen arrest the man who hung provocatively two huge flags on his balcony during the Good Friday liturgy in Famagusta? The police had asked him to remove them and he refused but he was not arrested or taken to court,\" said Adamidou.\n\nDuring the latest hearing on Tuesday, 15 people gathered in support outside of the court. The couple's friends are also trying to better inform the public.\n\nTo show his support, following the trial postponement, Sener Elcil, the Turkish Cypriot Teacher's Syndicate's (KTÖS) General Secretary, released an announcement saying that the incident has fully exposed the policies of the breakaway regime and that policies like these were designed to force Turkish Cypriots to leave the island. He also said that the trial of the couple was an occupation policy and Turkish Cypriots were becoming a minority in their own country.\n\n\"Holding and hanging the Cyprus Republic flag is not a crime. The related trial against Koray and Cinel Basdogrultmaci is completely political and Turkish authorities are the ones who are responsible,\" the announcement said. Ercil expressed his support and solidarity to the couple and his intention to cite international law in support of anyone who's been treated unfairly by the system."}
{"text": "\"I'm a Little Bit Country\" is the fourth episode of Season Seven, and the 100th overall episode of South Park. It aired on April 9, 2003.[1]\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe boys join some anti-war protesters because it's a free pass out of school for the day. Their simple plan to protest their way out of class goes south when they find themselves in the middle of the two opposing sides of the issue. Meanwhile, Cartman attempts a flashback to 1776 to avoid studying for his American History assignment.\n\nPlot\n\nThis episode originally aired during the beginning of the 2003 United States invasion of Iraq. When Mr. Garrison agrees to let anyone protesting the war out of school early for a rally, all the kids say that they are against the war and then leave, even though they know little about the war, terrorists, or the founding fathers. They are then interviewed outside the school for their views on what the Founding Fathers would think about the conflict and show their ignorance by not knowing who the founding fathers were. Angered by the embarrassment, Mr. Garrison gives everybody an assignment to figure out an opinion on the Founders' view of the war. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny begin to study for their projects; Cartman however decides to take a different approach, trying (and failing) to induce a flashback of the colonial era first by saying a cliched flashback inducing dialog, and then by dropping a large rock on his own head.\n\nMeanwhile, the people of the town are divided about the war, and after splitting in two, they both plan rallies: one pro-war, one anti-war, both on the same day in the same place. They wind up having a great argument during both rallies, and in the end, they get into a huge fight where they begin to kill each other. They later decided to use the boys to get them what they think about the war. Meanwhile, Cartman electrocutes himself in water with a TV OH! full of colonial documentaries from The History Channel in order to induce a flashback. He falls into a coma, and having a dream, he travels back to the colonial era in Philadelphia. With a single murder, he manages to get the job of delivering the Declaration of Independence from Thomas Jefferson's home to the Continental Congress for a vote; there, a great argument breaks out about whether or not to go to war against United Kingdom, paralleling the events in town, which Cartman recognizes as being \"very, very relevant\".\n\nDuring the concert, Stan and the others tell everyone that they didn't do their report because they really don't know what's going on about the world. This caused everyone to kill each other.\n\nBenjamin Franklin shows up, as voiced by famed TV producer Norman Lear, also creative consultant for this episode. Franklin believes that the new country must not seem to be a war-monger to the rest of the world; at the same time it cannot seem to be weak either. Therefore it must go to war, but allow protests. The United States will go to war on one hand, and use protest to oppose the war on the other. He refers to the this as \"saying one thing\" and \"doing another\". One member refers to this as \"having our cake and eating it too\". Cartman wakes up and delivers his message to the town, who see the truth of that statement and then break out into song (a version of \"I'm a Little Bit Country\" by Donny and Marie Osmond). In it, they celebrate their differences and their achievement (100 episodes); ending the song with the line, \"For the war, against the war- who cares! One hundred episodes!\". The 100th episode of the series ends with Kyle in disbelief that it was Cartman who saved the day and then saying \"I hate this town. I really, really do\".\n\nReferences"}
{"text": "\"The Art Behind the Tape\" is a Coffee Table Book exploring the History of Mixtape Cover Art.\n\nFor those that know me and specifically those who are in my email database,it is a known fact that i have been toying around with this \"History of Mix tapes\" project for quite some time. After purchasing a book on rappers and there jewelry collection(BLING BLING),i started to think about what other hip hop related stories there are that haven't been told. Very naturally it dawned on me that no one has told the story about the history of mix tapes,especially the cover art. I found that interesting, especially since it's such a global phenomenon. For months i wrestled with the idea, i even thought i would give it to another writer,and let them tell the story(bad idea,glad i didn't do it). So i took to the drawing board and started to put pen to the pad and jot down a list of dj's who shaped the game. Finally my idea started to take some shape and form. The initial idea shifted a little though. At first i was going to write a coffee table book based on the entire history of the mix tape movement. Then i decided,nah maybe i will film a documentary on the history of mixtapes (in the works as i type). So now that the idea has some form and shape to it,i again put pen to the pad and started to shake it up a bit. Since i plan on directing a documentary on the entire history of mixtapes, I figured the book should be a little different. Me and my creative team decided to focus on the cover art instead of the dj's. This new direction allows for the documentary and book to focus on mix tapes but from two different angles.\n\nI remember as a kid i would stare at album covers and marvel at some the art work. For instance A Tribe Called Quests \"Low End Theory\", De La Soul's \"3 Feet High and Rising\",to Big Daddy Kane's \"Long Live the Kane\". All three covers gave you a mental picture of the music before you heard one song. Surprisingly mix tape covers have taken on the same role. For example, Dj Drama's early Gangsta Grillz series artwork looked better than some of those artists album covers. When Dj Clue wanted to separate himself from the pack,it was the imagery done by the crew from P Type Graphics. History was starting to repeat itself in a very important way.\n\nWith all of these thoughts bouncing in my head,i thought what better way to represent them than to write a book displaying this very dope piece of mix tape history. From that thought forward i decided to put together a coffee table book displaying a visual history of mixtape art. From the days when the Kid Capri's of the world just wrote dates on their tape \"Kid Capri 2-18\". To the current era where a mix tape dj would commission a skilled graphic designer to craft a piece of marketable art that would allow the tape to compete with an album.\n\nSo there you have it,my idea in all its glory. I felt the best way to do it is for me to do it. Going the traditional route and seeking a publishing house would be cool,but what if they wanted to change the direction? What if they only wanted to cover the dj's they felt were MTV material,no thats not the real story. I want to tell the story from an insiders perspective,from the perspective of a kid who bought and coveted mix tapes. I want the visual history to include the Dj Green Lantern's as well as the Dj iroc's,and everyone in between.\n\nAt its core hip hop is all about independence and self expression. I feel it is my duty as a card carrying member of the hip hop community to tell this story the right way!\n\n-DJ MARS"}
{"text": "Mat Staver, the head of the anti-LGBTQ legal group Liberty Counsel, returned to his favorite analogy last week, saying that the Southern Poverty Law Center's labeling of his group as an anti-gay hate group is part of a persecution of Christians in America reminiscent of the treatment of Jews in Nazi Germany, and linked the removal of Confederate monuments throughout the country to a larger \"civil war against our values\" happening in the U.S.\n\nSeveral years ago, the SPLC started adding anti-gay groups like Liberty Counsel to its lists of hate groups, noting that its decision to label these groups as hate groups was generally \"based on their propagation of known falsehoods\" about LGBTQ people and specifying that \"[v]iewing homosexuality as unbiblical does not qualify organizations for listing as hate groups.\" However, this has not stopped many of the anti-LGBTQ groups whom the SPLC has listed from claiming that they are merely on the list because of an opposition to marriage equality.\n\nIn an interview on VCY America's \"Crosstalk\" program on August 22, Staver said that SPLC knows that these anti-LGBTQ groups \"are not violent organizations, they know that they are Christian organizations, and they know that they oppose any kind of hatred or violence. They just don't agree with us on the issue of marriage.\" (SPLC has never claimed that Liberty Counsel or its anti-LGBTQ allies are \"violent organizations.\")\n\nWhen the host of the program, Jim Schneider, asked how far the nation would let this sort of thing go, Staver issued a dire warning.\n\n\"I think that's a question that everyone listening here needs to answer,\" he said, \"I think we've crossed the line and we can't let this go any further. We've got to push back, it cannot happen like this. You know, if you go back into the 1930s, what ultimately happened back then with the Jews—and history, you know, there's other histories you can point to—but they began to ultimately ban Jews from public employment, then ban Jews from their private employment, then put a Star of David on their ID and a Star of David on their passport, restrict their travel, restrict their income opportunity, and eventually you know what happened, we had to fight a World War II over that issue.\"\n\n(Speaking of travel restrictions, Staver went on the radio to defend President Trump's travel ban for residents of several Muslim-majority nations earlier this year.)\n\nLater in the interview, Staver lamented the \"coarsening of discourse and a lack of morals and integrity\" in American political debates, which he chalked up to \"the erosion of our Judeo-Christian values\" and what he claimed is intolerance of dissent.\n\n\"That is so much different than anything we've ever had before,\" he said, \"and continuing on this way, I think it's almost, it's like a civil war against our values, it's a war against the very essence of who we are.\"\n\nHe continued: \"And there's a number, like Antifa, that's an anarchist group, they call themselves anarchists. I mean, an anarchist is somebody who wants to create anarchy, this is to just to completely destroy all the institutions. And you see this happening with the monuments. You know, I understand the concern people have against the Confederate monuments, I get all that, I understand that, I have a lot of people, a lot of friends that are affected by that. On the other hand, I have a lot of friends who say, 'Look, this is part of our history.'\"\n\nHe added that \"if we want to start taking down our history, our monuments, because certain people were not at the same level that we want them to be today\" the only monuments that would remain would be those of Jesus Christ."}

(Sept. 9) AP\n\nIn this 2013 image provided by the U.S. Navy, the USS Zumwalt is floated out of dry dock. (Photo: AP)\n\nWASHINGTON — It may be time to consign the $800,000-per-shell cost of the new destroyer USS Zumwalt's long-range ammunition to that dubious list of Pentagon-procured $640 toilet seats, $37 screws and $436 hammers.\n\nThe Navy has reportedly balked at the price and isn't planning to buy more. Navy spokeswoman Capt. Thurraya S. Kent, without addressing the price issue, would say only that \"to address evolving threats and mission requirements, the Navy is evaluating industry projectile solutions (including conventional and hypervelocity projectiles) that can also meet the DDG 1000 deployment schedule and could potentially be used as an alternative to LRLAP.\"\n\nDDG 1000 is the Navy designation of the Zumwalt. LRLAP refers to the Long Range Land-Attack Projectile.\n\nIn a follow-up email, Kent clarified that she had not said the Navy has abandoned the LRLAP.\n\nDefense News, quoting an unnamed Navy official, broke the story that the long-range shells for the newest U.S. Navy destroyer, named after Vietnam-era Chief of Naval Operations Elmo R. Zumwalt, are too expensive at $800,000 each, and no more will be purchased.\n\nThat makes the stealthy ship, still more than a year from deployment as a weapons system, unable to do some of its primary missions: softening up beachheads for Marine landings and taking out inland terror-training camps.\n\nRecords show the Navy budgeted for 150 of the 7-feet-long, 225-pound shells for $476,946 each in 2015. The price rose as the number of Zumwalt-class destroyers the Navy plans to build fell from 32 to three. The first, the USS Zumwalt, was commissioned in Baltimore last month and is currently en route to its San Diego home port.\n\nDan Grazier, the Jack Shanahan Fellow at the Project on Government Oversight, the nonprofit watchdog group that discovered the toilet seat and hammer costs in the 1980s, said he was skeptical that a Navy that routinely shoots million-dollar Tomahawk cruise missiles was deterred by the cost.\n\nThe former Marine captain, who trained making amphibious landings aided by artillery, said the Navy wants to use the advanced electro-magnetic pulse-powered rail guns on the new class of destroyers.\n\n\"I don't think the Navy's really interested in a gun cotton-powered weapon anymore,\" he said. \"That's so 20th century.\"\n\nLockheed Martin, the projectile manufacturer, released a statement addressing the Zumwalt ammunition situation: \"As the DDG 1000's mission continues to evolve, and taking into consideration funding profiles available to support the weaponization of the ship in light of the severe reduction in the planned production quantities, the U.S. Navy decided to evaluate alternate solutions to LRLAP. Lockheed Martin is working aggressively to provide the Navy with options in relation to the DDG-1000's long-range land attack mission.\"\n\nThe 610-foot Zumwalt was designed to lie off the coast and lob the shells with GPS precision at targets as much as 80 miles away at up to 10 per minute.\n\nBecause of its angular design features, the ship's radar signature makes it look to adversaries like a small fishing boat.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2g3xI5O"}

We'll never know the real answer, but what do you think? Back when Lucasfilm was first purchased by Disney and the new trilogy was first announced, it sounded like the idea was to use ideas that George Lucas already had as the foundation of the new films. That didn't last very long. We've seen clips of an interview with Lucas over the last couple of weeks where he began to explain why the breakdown occurred. Now the full interview has been released, and we have even more of George Lucas being obviously unhappy with the direction that Disney has taken his beloved Star Wars For better or worse, it's difficult to argue now that The Force Awakens went back to the well when it came to a lot of the aspects of the movie. They wanted to recapture the love that fans had for the original film, and so they used it as a template for what they were going to do with the new one. For George Lucas, this was the problem, as he tells Charlie Rose , because he doesn't see the point in making a movie if you're not going to do something new.It's true that these days it seems nearly every movie in the theater is either a reboot or a sequel, or at least based on some previously existing material. Lucas actually takes some of the blame for that in the interview, saying that the success of the original Star Wars trilogy was the beginning of that very trend.

{"text": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\n\nDeloitte Touche is one of the globe's \"big four\" auditing and consulting firms. It's a player in the Big Food/Ag space—Deloitte's clients include \"75% of the Fortune 500 food production companies.\" The firm's US subsidiary, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has a shiny new asset to dangle before its agribusiness clients: It has hired the US Department of Agriculture's Undersecretary for Food Safety, Elisabeth Hagen. She will \"join Deloitte's consumer products practice as a food safety senior advisor,\" the firm stated in a press release. The firm also trumpeted her USDA affiliation:\n\n\"Elisabeth will bring to Deloitte an impressive blend of regulatory level oversight and hands-on experience, stemming from her role as the highest ranking food safety official in the U.S.,\" said Pat Conroy, vice chairman, Deloitte LLP, and Deloitte's U.S. consumer products practice leader.\n\nLast month, Hagen announced her imminent resignation from her USDA post, declaring she would be \"embarking in mid-December on a new challenge in the private sector.\" Now we know what that \"challenge\" is. It's impressive that Deloitte managed to bag a sitting USDA undersecretary—especially the one holding the food safety portfolio, charged with overseeing the nation's slaughterhouses. Awkwardly, Hagen is still \"currently serving\" her USDA role, the Deloitte press release states. I'm sure the challenge of watchdogging the meat industry while preparing to offer it consulting services won't last long. The USDA has not announced a time frame for replacing Hagen.\n\nHagen won't be the only member of Deloitte's US food-safety team with ties to the federal agencies charged with overseeing the food industry. You know those new poultry-slaughter rules that Hagen's erstwhile fiefdom, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service, keeps touting, the ones that would save Big Poultry a quarter-billion dollars a year but likely endanger consumers and workers alike, as I laid out most recently here? Craig Henry, a director within Deloitte's food & product safety practice, served on the USDA-appointed National Advisory Committee on Meat and Poultry Inspection, which advised the FSIS on precisely those rules, as this 2012 Federal Register notice shows.\n\nThen there's Faye Feldstein, who serves Deloitte as a senior adviser for food safety issues, the latest post in what her Deloitte bio calls a \"33-year career in senior positions in the food industry and in federal and state regulatory agencies.\" Before setting up shop as a consultant, Feldstein served a ten-year stint at the Food and Drug Administration in various food-safety roles. Before that, she worked for 12 years at W.R. Grace, a chemical conglomerate with interests in food additives and packaging.\n\nApart from Hagen's new career direction, some food-safety advocates have offered praise for her tenure at USDA. They point out that, under her leadership, the FSIS cracked down on certain strains of E. coli in ground beef, an important and long-overdue move explained in this post by the veteran journalist Maryn McKenna. On his blog, Bill Marler, a prominent litigator of food-borne illness cases on behalf of consumers, called Hagen \"one of the very best who has ever held that position,\" adding that she'll be \"sorely missed.\"\n\nBut if the USDA does make good on its oft-stated intention to finalize those awful new poultry rules, I think Hagen will be remembered most for pushing them ahead, to the delight of the poultry industry and the despair of worker and consumer-safety advocates."}

This is rather negative, because one should persevere even in the most difficult of circumstances,\" he said.\n\nA member of her campaign team, reviewing her performance on Tuesday, said she could be more articulate in Sunday's debate – the last chance for the candidates to cross swords.\n\n\"She should relax her pace and spend more time elaborating her governance visions and policies,\" he said.\n\nSome 1,194 members of the Election Committee will choose the next chief executive from three candidates – Lam, Tsang and retired judge Woo Kwok-hing – on March 26.\n\nLam's clarification came after another verbal stumble last weekend when she was slammed for likening online comments critical of her and her supporters to \"white terror\".\n\nFormer security minister Ambrose Lee Siu-kwong, now a local deputy to the National People's Congress, said he did not watch the debate, but he took the chance to take a swipe at Tsang.\n\nLam had named supporter and popular actress Josephine Siao – who has a hearing disability – as a victim of \"white terror\", but Tsang had argued that \"online comments are not white terror\", adding freedom of speech was one of the city's core values.\n\nLee said of Tsang's retort: \"I am very unhappy to see [him] tolerate cyberbullying of a disabled actress who is well respected by Hongkongers.\" Lee had also earlier indicated his preference for Lam.\n\nBut another National People's Congress deputy, Michael Tien Puk-sun from the New People's Party, described Lam's performance in the last debate as \"disappointing\". He added that he was inclined to vote for Tsang.\n\n\"I'm surprised to hear Lam saying she would resign if she became too unpopular,\" Tien said. He noted that a leader should not easily buckle under pressure, and claimed that Lam also lacked political sensitivity."}

An enormous outbreak in Florida is now fouling beaches on the east coast, and a 2014 outbreak at Lake Erie left more than 400,000 people in the Toledo area without tap water for two days.\n\nUtah Lake doesn't provide drinking water, but its closure is causing big problems for people who use the lake for swimming, fishing and other activities, and for farmers with thirsty crops.\n\nUtah poison control says it has fielded hundreds of calls related to the bloom, including 130 involving people who have reported vomiting, diarrhea, headache and rashes.\n\nThe contamination has now spread to the Jordan river, which supplies irrigation to dozens of farmers around Salt Lake City, about 45 miles north of the lake. The problem has occurred amid days of triple-digit temperatures as growers prepare for farmers markets and try to nurture crops such as corn and fruit trees at key points in their development.\n\n\"We've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on this crop, maxed out every dollar we have,\" said Luke Petersen, who farms about 100 acres of tomatoes, summer squash and other produce in Riverton. \"We're real worried about it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Bonneville School of Sailing has had to cancel more than a dozen groups since the lake was closed.\n\n\"This will be a real hit,\" said co-owner Todd Frye. He loves the mountain-rimmed lake and has worked to change the decades-old perception that it's murky and polluted. New efforts to clean out bottom-feeding carp are improving the water quality, but he worries the algae bloom will be a blow to its image.\n\nThe lake is largely fed by treated wastewater as well as agricultural runoff, said Erica Gaddis, assistant director for the Utah division of water quality.\n\nLongstanding drought conditions have made the water especially low and stagnant. Combine that with hot summer weather and Utah Lake became a perfect petri dish for the cyanobacteria.\n\nThere are chemical and biological treatments for the problem, but using them on such a large bloom would be unprecedented and possibly harmful, Gaddis said.\n\nFor now, authorities are waiting for the bloom to run its course and clear, hopefully aided by a drop in temperatures or a storm that could stir up the water and reduce stagnation.\n\nOne bit of good news is that early test results indicate levels of dangerous toxins produced by the bacteria may not be as high as feared, though the state is still waiting for more data.\n\nTo stave off new blooms in coming years, the state is looking to reduce the levels of toxic algae-feeding phosphorous and nitrogen in wastewater that's pumped into the lake. That could be difficult, however, because cities served by those plants include some of the fastest-growing in the nation.\n\n\"We've been loading the Utah Lake in one form or another for 150 years, and it's catching up with us,\" Gaddis said."}
{"text": "Over the past few offseasons, the Sabres have added loads of talent to their forward ranks, drafting players like Jack Eichel and Sam Reinhart, and trading for players such as Ryan O'Reilly and Evander Kane. With the #8 pick in this year's draft, the Sabres should have their pick of a number of excellent prospects to add to their young pool of talent, and in the annual SB Nation mock draft, we chose to add another talented forward with some Atlantic Division connections.\n\nWith the #8 pick in the 2016 SBN mock draft, the Buffalo Sabres (and Die By The Blade) select Alexander Nylander.\n\nAlex Nylander, RW/LW, Mississauga Steelheads (OHL)\n\n2015-16 Regular Season: 57 GP, 28-47-75\n\n2015-16 Playoffs: 6 GP, 6-6-12\n\nNylander brings speed and skill to the forward ranks of a Sabres organization still in need of that, despite their recent acquisitions. He has a game similar to Sam Reinhart - with high marks in vision, playmaking ability, puck control, and Hockey IQ. He also has some similar concerns about needing to add more muscle to thrive in the NHL, currently measuring in at 6'0'' and about 175 lbs, but as this season went along he improved on his ability to battle for space with and without the puck, and certainly has the family pedigree to know what it takes to play in the NHL. He's a right handed shot who's played plenty of left wing, so he's also a versatile player to plug in to the lineup.\n\nIn addition to his serious offensive skills, Nylander is also an excellent skater who scored the highest mark at the NHL Combine in a test that measures anaerobic peak power - essentially, one's ability to stay explosive even when tired. We know strong combine numbers catch Tim Murray's eye, and being a strong skater has become a prerequisite to being an NHL player these days. Nylander checks both of boxes in a big way, and when combined with his strong game sense and playmaking ability, you've got a prospect who can be a vital contributor among any team's top six forwards, and should find a place with Eichel and Reinhart as a key member of the Sabres new core.\n\nHow did we decide on Nylander?\n\nTo be honest, I was hoping for one of the two top defensemen to fall to Buffalo at #8, either Olli Juolevi or Jakob Chychrun, but with those two off the board already, our choice came down to defenseman Mikhail Sergachev or Nylander. Sergachev would be a nice addition to a Sabres blue line that needs another contributor next season, and he will bring both tenacity and offensive skill to whichever team drafts him. It's also worth noting that the Sabres reportedly had 20 people at his combine interview, so you know the team has him on their radar.\n\nBut Nylander would bring two unique aspects to the Sabres organization. The first is the obvious connection - his brother William Nylander plays for the Toronto Maple Leafs, and by drafting Alex, the Sabres and Leafs would add another juicy aspect to a rivalry between two young, growing teams. The second interesting thing about Nylander is that he is immediately eligible to play in the AHL next season. Since he was on loan to Mississauga this season, he's still technically under contract in Sweden, so he isn't bound to the same AHL restrictions that under-20 players face thanks to the CHL-NHL agreement. That means he could play for the Amerks next season, and potentially be a call up should the Sabres choose to do so.\n\nThe draft so far\n\nFollow the rest of SBN's mock draft here, and give us your thoughts on our pick of Alex Nylander in the comments."}
