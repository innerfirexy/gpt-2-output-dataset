(KOIN) --- The city of Molalla is warning residents and visitors to be on the lookout for poison hemlock.\n\nCopyright by KOIN - All rights reserved Poison hemlock (Colorado State University)\n\nCopyright by KOIN - All rights reserved Poison hemlock (Colorado State University)\n\nPoison hemlock is toxic and can be fatal to humans, pets and livestock.\n\nThe city says the weed is found in every county in Oregon but was only recently discovered within Molalla city limits.\n\nThe city of Molalla described the plant so residents know what to look for: Poison hemlock is a biennial plant that can grow as tall as four to nine feet. The hollow stem is smooth and hairless and has very distinctive purple blotches all over it. It also has large, glossy green, finely divided, fern-like leaves that are smooth and hairless. Its flower is similar in appearance to Queen Anne's lace and wild carrot.\n\nThe city says it is easy to get rid of by hand pulling and using herbicide treatments, although you should wear long sleeves when controlling it. It isn't safe to burn the plant either, because the toxins can be carried into the air.\n\nIn 399 BC, the philosopher Socrates was found guilty of \"corrupting the youth\" and of \"refusing to recognized the gods recognized by the state.\" He was sentenced to death, and Athenian law said he must drink a cup of poison hemlock.\n\nThe executioner arrived and told Socrates, \"Just drink it and walk around until your legs begin to feel heavy, then lie down. It will soon act.\"\n\nIt did. Socrates was 70."}

{"text": "A woman from East Liverpool, Ohio, is spending some quality time in the Columbiana County Jail and will be there for the next six months after she was convicted of voter fraud. The woman, Rebecca A. Hammonds, was a paid canvasser for a liberal activist group called Ohio Organizing Collaborative (OOC) where she was paid to register voters in 2015.\n\nUnfortunately for both Hammonds and Ohio, she went in a direction that anyone with half a brain would know was wrong.\n\nIn October of that year, the county elections board director contacted the sheriff's office after his staff began finding discrepancies in voter registration applications filed by OOC, including five submitted in the name of dead people. The sheriff's office conducted the initial probe before turning the investigation over to the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation, a division of the Ohio Attorney General's Office, which handled the prosecution. The felony charges carried a maximum possible one-year prison sentence on each count. Brian Deckert, an associate assistant attorney general, had recommended a one-year prison sentence for Hammonds but he did not oppose her request for probation. At Monday's sentencing hearing, Deckert said Hammonds was paid an hourly rate and not per voter registration, so it was not \"a situation where she had a quota system … I think it just may have come down to human laziness,\" he said of Hammonds' actions. Public defender Jennifer Gorby attributed her client's actions to \"a lack of judgment on her part\" and that she engaged in this behavior to keep her job.\n\nHammonds claims that she believes that no one at OOC was aware of her activities.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that there is another reason besides laziness that could be a factor. For example, Hammonds may have intended for someone to actually use those registrations to cast fraudulent votes in an attempt to sway elections. The phrase \"vote early, vote often\" doesn't just apply in Chicago, you know."}

{"text": "I was in bed with a stranger when I first saw a tweet about Frank Ocean's now infamous 2012 Tumblr post—the one in which the singer revealed that his debut album, Channel Orange, was, in part, about a boy. It was the middle of the night, and I turned over to check my phone. The boy I was with, who I'd picked up at a terrible gay club on the west side of Manhattan and who I never saw again, didn't know who Frank Ocean was and wasn't terribly excited by this information. So I smiled privately. This is often how life happens now: on your phone, in bed, at 2AM, excitingly alone with the glow of the screen as the world around you changes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMost celebrities collaborate with old media for their big reveals. Ellen Degeneres, America's most famous gay person, came out on her network television show, acting out a scripted screenplay in which she told Oprah her truth. Caitlyn Jenner, America's most famous trans person, spoke with Diane Sawyer and Vanity Fair to explain her identity. Not Ocean. He uploaded a shitty-looking screengrab of a TextEdit file—which, judging by the freeform cadence of the writing, hadn't been edited by anyone else. He owned his story in one fell swoop, telling us exactly what he wanted and absolutely nothing more.\n\nMy own coming-out experience as a gay man unfurled in a string of sloppy conversations, tears, and stunted truths—a mess that I still have not, more than ten years later, fully cleaned up. So I suppose I envy Ocean. I'm sure that his own coming out was way more complicated than any single Tumblr post could suggest, but at least on that day in July, he ripped his fears off like a Band-Aid. \"I've never had more respect for life and living than I have right now,\" he wrote confidently. \"I feel like a free man.\""}
{"text": "If you haven't been paying attention: Republicans have been so gung-ho about stripping health care from millions of people and giving tax cuts to a few monstrously rich people that at the end of September they needlessly let the Children's Health Plan (CHIP) expire - just like too many kids and adults s will if the GOP can't figure out how to act like human beings, and govern accordingly. Currently, CHIP provides health care to almost nine million children nationwide; if Congress, which has historically summoned a reasonable facsimile of bi-partisan support for what most normal people would consider a basic human need, can't find the will to reauthorize it in the next few weeks, at least 16 states will run out of funding by January 1.\n\n\nMany good people, including Jimmy Kimmel and Alabama's newly-elected Doug Jones, have urged lawmakers to confront the grotesque negligence toward children that would be the demise of CHIP. But Rachel Pearson, a cheeky pediatrician in Texas who used to believe everyone deserved health care, says she's come to learn those in need are \"ungrateful, yowling, diapered maniacs who don't even use language right\" and are often \"literally carried from place to place in the arms of a real taxpayer.\" \"Most of my patients have never worked a day in their lives,\" she writes. \"Patients have punched me, bitten me, screamed at me, and even urinated on me...Sometimes, I have to bribe my patients with bright-colored objects, juice or graham crackers. (Do) my patients thank me? Do they contribute to the economy? No!...\" If CHIP isn't funded, she adds, perhaps letting more American kids die preventable deaths \"will send a strong message to kids across the country: Pull your thumbs out of your mouths, get potty-trained and GET A JOB!\" Hopefully, eventually, one that would remove the GOP from power."}

His painting Net of Being–inspired by a blazing vision of an infinite grid of Godheads during an ayahuasca journey–has reached millions as the cover and interior of the band TOOL's Grammy award–winning triple-platinum album, 10,000 Days. Net of Being is one of many images Grey has created that have resulted in a chain reaction of uses–from apparel and jewelry to tattoos and music videos–embedding these iconic works into our culture's living Net of Being.\n\nThe book explores how the mystical experience expressed in Alex Grey's work opens a new understanding of our shared consciousness and unveils the deep influence art can have on cultural evolution. The narrative progresses through a successive expansion of identity–from the self, to self and beloved, to self and community, world spirit, and cosmic consciousness, where bodies are transparent to galactic energies. Presenting over 200 images, including many never-before-reproduced paintings as well as masterworks such as St. Albert and the LSD Revelation Revolution and Godself, the book also documents performance art, live-painting on stage throughout the world, and the \"social sculpture\" called CoSM, Chapel of Sacred Mirrors, that Grey cofounded with his wife and creative collaborator, artist Allyson Grey."}

{"text": "TV/Movie/Other: Clockwork Angels: The Novel\nSmoked at: Cigar Jacks\nI obtained this cigar via another Redditor like myself. It has a medium coloured wrapper, and a double band bearing both the name and the blend. After cutting the cigar with a V-cutter, I took a cold draw, and was both surprised and worried at how loose the draw was. I lit it with a triple torch lighter, toasting the foot nicely first. I was immediately met with sweet, almost hazelnut notes and a very nice mild spice. The ash was a nice white colour, and didn't seem at all flaky.\nAn inch and a half into this stick, the burn became uneven. I flipped it over to let the underside catch up, but it was no use. I had to even it up with a single torch lighter that one of the Jacks regulars had laying around. The mild spice had faded at that point into rich, much more spicy tobacco overtones with sweet coffee undertones. The ash held on for an inch and a half before falling off (albeit this was my fault, as I jostled the stick setting it down).\nMore than halfway through, the flavours started to change again. I love this about Rocky Patel cigars; generally, they are very fluid and changing throughout the length of the smoke. Very prominent oaky flavours are mingling with the hazelnut undertones now, and the spice is still quite strong and in your face. Unfortunately, the burn is quite uneven, even after touch-ups. I put the single torch to the uneven part once more. In the last two inches or so, it grew slightly hot, and I set it down to die.\nFinal verdict: very flavourful and changing stick (hazelnut, coffee, oak, spice) with nice ash and quite a few burn problems. Full bodied. Overall, a good stick, but not for every day. 84/100"}

The game was running in a triple-monitor configuration on the SimCraft APEX3 GT motion simulation rig, allowing attendees to drive the Toyota TS030.\n\nAs most readers will realize, this is very unusual. Although other \"motion rigs\" have been used with GT games before, they were custom-built, one-off implementations, or generated motion feedback from controller inputs, like the Subaru Simulator running GT4 or the Audi motion rigs used at European game shows.\n\nTo find out if that was the case here, I reached out to SimCraft and learned the technology behind this demo is much more interesting, and the company has been working closely with Polyphony Digital for quite some time to refine the motion feedback:\n\n\"We're pulling physics data out of the PlayStation; we have a full motion interface with Gran Turismo 6 that allows us to pull the physics files that we need in order to control pitch, roll, and yaw,\" said SimCraft brand manager Sean Yoder. \"It's running real-time chassis dynamics and terrain dynamics, so what you're seeing there is actually the race surface as it is in the game.\"\n\nTo be clear, this does not indicate motion simulation for consumers is coming to Gran Turismo any time soon, but it is a positive sign things are moving in that direction.\n\nAlthough motion simulators are currently too expensive for most people (the APEX3 rig in the video above starts at $30,000 USD), Sean confirmed that SimCraft is hard at work developing a significantly lower-priced platform, designed to bring motion simulation to mass-market consumers.\n\nIf SimCraft can pull that off – and Polyphony Digital decides to support motion simulators – the next few years could see a rapid evolution in console driving games.\n\nMore Posts On..."}

What's up with that?\n\nI try not to hate-read conservative racist comments anymore, because they just take up room in my brain and they don't do anyone any good. But Mary Noble at Politix linked to this astounding review of 12 Years a Slave by James Bowman in the conservative American Spectator, and it's forced me to break my self-imposed ban on hate-reading:\n\nIf ever in slavery's 250-year history in North America there were a kind master or a contented slave, as in the nature of things there must have been, here and there, we may be sure that Mr McQueen does not want us to hear about it...Yes, there was much cruelty and hardship in the slave-owning South, as there has been in most of the rest of the world most of the time, and Mr. McQueen's camera is all over that. But it strains ordinary credulity to suppose that there was nothing else.\n\nSometimes, it's worth reading idiotic pieces like this to understand how the other side thinks. The modern Republican Party is so excited by its own contrarianism—the globe is not warming, health care does not need reform—that it's basically become a giant no-producing machine. To the conservative mindset, if a liberal institution like Hollywood comes out with a statement about slavery, then that statement must be inherently wrong. This is what has become of William F. Buckley's famous statement about conservatism:\n\nA conservative is someone who stands athwart history, yelling Stop, at a time when no one is inclined to do so, or to have much patience with those who so urge it.\n\nBuckley's statement has never been so true than with Bowman's piece.

Salmaan Taseer have stepped up calls for Asia Bibi, a Catholic woman sentenced to die for blasphemy, to be put to death. Hundreds of supporters of the Islamist group Pakistan Sunni Tehreek staged rallies across Pakistan on April 16 calling for Bibi's execution and the deaths of other blasphemers. The rallies in Karachi, Rawalpindi, Lahore and other cities were organized by Sunni Tehreek head, Sarwat Ijaz Qadri, as part of the group's response to the execution of Mumtaz Qadri. Qadri, Taseer's bodyguard, shot the former governor for speaking out against the country's controversial blasphemy laws. Bibi, a Catholic mother of five, was convicted of blasphemy and sentenced to death after being accused of insulting the Prophet Muhammad by a group of Muslim women who were angry Bibi drank from the same water container as them. If executed, Bibi would become the first woman in Pakistan to be executed for blasphemy. Pakistan's Supreme Court is due to hear an appeal by Bibi against her sentence. \"We will protect the sanctity of Holy Prophet at every cost and will not sit idle if Asia Bibi Masih is freed,\" Pakistan Sunni Tehreek said in a statement read out at all rally sites. \"The whole nation will take to the streets … if any blasphemer was sent abroad,\" the group warned. If Bibi wins her appeal it is expected she will be forced to go into exile. The group also said authorities had deliberately tried to weaken blasphemy laws by executing Mumtaz Qadri. \"A conspiracy is being hatched. ... We will not let it happen. The rulers have begun a war with religious forces by hanging Mumtaz Qadri,\" the statement concluded.\n\nSign up to receive UCAN Daily Full Bulletin Thank you.

{"text": "Ron Guth\n\n1922 was the first year in which Peace Dollars were produced at the San Francisco mint. The mintage for this year was the second largest of all the Peace Dollars, following closely behind the 1923-S. Compared to Peace Dollars made a the Philadelphia and Denver mints in 1922, the S-Mint suffers from a lower level of quality, particularly in the area of strike. Many 1922-S Peace Dollars show weakness in the centers on both sides, translating into weak hair details over Liberty's ear and poorly defined feathers on the highest points of the eagle. Many 1922-S Peace Dollar suffer from bagmarks and surface abrasions received as the coins were transported in bags from the San Francisco Mint. As a result, the grade encountered most frequently on a 1922-S Peace Dollar is MS-63. Unlike the 1922-P and 1922-D, where the populations in MS-63 and MS-64 are nearly equal, the population of the MS-64 1922-S is over 20% less than in MS-63. In MS-65, the population drops off significantly, leaving barely enough coins to satisfy collector demand. In MS-66, the 1922-S Peace Dollar is a true condition-rarity and only a few coins have earned this grade. As of this writing (8/21/2015), no MS-67 or better 1922-S Peace Dollars have been certified by PCGS. Luster ranges from flat and dullish to frosty white. Coins with hard, chrome-like surfaces are rare. Finding a 1922-S Peace Dollar that combines problem-free surfaces, a full strike, and bold luster is a real challenge.\n\nAccording to a notice in the June 1934 issue of The Numismatist (p. 416), collectors could still purchase Uncirculated 1922-S Peace Dollars for \"the face value of the coins and an amount sufficient to cover the mail charrges by first-class mail.\"\n\nQ.

{"text": "Electronic Frontiers Australia (EFA) welcomes today's announcement by Communications Minister Stephen Conroy that the government has finally abandoned its plans to introduce mandatory internet filtering. EFA, through its Open Internet campaign, was one of the many civil society groups that campaigned hard against this policy over a number of years.\n\nThe internet is built on open standards, and EFA strongly believes that maintaining its open nature is critical to ensuring that it continues to be a powerful platform for disseminating information, connecting communities, increasing transparency, driving innovation and enabling global commerce. EFA fully understands that such an open network also creates a number of serious challenges for government, particularly in relation to law enforcement and security.\n\nTop-down, one-size-fits-all approaches to dealing with these challenges, such as the government's now-abandoned mandatory internet filter, are not appropriate, nor likely to be effective in terms of outcomes or value for money. More nuanced policy approaches that employ proportionate technical responses, combined with empowering individuals, particularly through education, are in most cases likely to be much more successful.\n\nWe are therefore pleased that the government appears to now finally accept that its mandatory internet filter policy was such a top-down approach that was unworkable and posed a serious threat to free speech in Australia.\n\nWhile the government's new plan, for having ISPs block child abuse sites based on an Interpol-maintained list does amount to a form of internet filtering, it is currently of a very limited nature and involves a degree of transparency and accountability in relation to the list of blocked sites.\n\nWe continue to believe that filtering based on block lists is a relatively ineffective approach with a number of potential problems, however, this new policy appears to be a workable approach to addressing one aspect of the problem of harmful content.\n\nWe encourage policy-makers to undertake meaningful engagement with civil society groups early on in the policy formulation process to ensure that such poorly-designed policies are avoided in future."}

{"text": "Coffee may have hepatoprotective effects and higher coffee consumption has been associated inversely with levels of liver enzymatic markers. However, it is unclear whether decaffeinated coffee is also associated with liver enzymes. The study population included 27,793 participants, age 20 or older, in the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999‐2010). Coffee intake was evaluated by 24‐hour dietary recall. Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma‐glutamyl transaminase (GGT) were measured. We examined the relationship between coffee intake and enzymatic levels using weighted multiple variable logistic (abnormally elevated levels of enzymes) and linear regression (continuous enzymatic levels). Total coffee consumption was inversely associated with abnormal levels of all four liver enzymes and continuous levels of AST, ALP, and GGT. Compared to those reporting no coffee consumption, participants reporting ≥3 cups per day had an odds ratio (OR; 95% confidence interval [CI]) of 0.75 (0.63, 0.89), 0.82 (0.68, 0.98), 0.73 (0.55, 0.95), and 0.69 (0.57, 0.83) for abnormal levels of ALT, AST, ALP, and GGT, respectively. Similar inverse associations were found with decaffeinated coffee intake and abnormal levels of ALT (OR ≥2 vs 0 cup/d : 0.62 [0.41, 0.94]), AST (0.74 [0.49, 1.11]), and GGT (0.70 [0.49‐1.00]).

I'm not backing down from that system.\"\n\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee subsequently set up a \"Chickens for Checkups\" website offering a fake form letter in which people could offer items in exchange for health care - 10 chickens for rickets treatment, five sets of overalls for \"the vapors,\" etc.\n\nThe letter sarcastically concludes: \"Thanks for coming up with such a simple solution to a complicated problem!\" Jay Leno also mocked Lowden's suggestion.\n\nMany expected Lowden, who is hoping to take on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in the general election, to back off the comments. Instead, she is standing by them.\n\nLowden spokesperson Chrystal Feldman told The Plum Line's Greg Sargent that \"Americans are struggling to pay for their health care, and in order to afford coverage we must explore all options available to drive costs down.\"\n\n\"Bartering with your doctor is not a new concept,\" said Feldman. \"There have been numerous reports as to how negotiating with your doctor is an option and doctors have gone on the record verifying this.\"\n\nThe Lowden campaign also pointed Sargent to a letter to a Nevada newspaper from a rural doctor who said \"I can state from personal experience that bartering works.\"\n\n\"I have bartered with patients -- for alfalfa hay, a bath tub, yard work and horse shoeing in exchange for my care,\" said Dr. Robin L. Titus, a former Republican candidate for Senate who ended her campaign three months ago."}

Bornstein, who has been Trump's doctor for more than 35 years, believes Trump is healthy and his medical care is \"exactly up to date.\"\n\nHe also claimed that Trump has continued to annually undergo checkups and take important medical tests since first becoming a Bornstein patient in 1980.\n\nDr. Bornstein would not tell The New York Times whether he still works as President Trump's physician, while White House officials refused to comment on whether the information provided by Dr. Bornstein is accurate.\n\n\"At times in the interviews, Dr. Bornstein was moody, ranging from saying that Mr. Trump's health 'is none of your business' to later volunteering facts,\" reported The New York Times.\n\nBornstein has attracted media attention in the past due to his penchant for making colorful comments. These include downplaying the possibility that Trump, who at age 70 is America's oldest first-time elected president, could die in office. \"If something happens to him, then it happens to him,\" he said.\n\nThe doctor also ridiculed Hillary Clinton for her age, even though she is a year younger than Trump. \"She's an old lady,\" he said. \"She's an old lady. It's funny, isn't it?\"\n\nIn late 2015, Bornstein wrote in a health report, \"If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.\"\n\nDespite Trump's advanced age, during the 2016 presidential election more focus was placed on Clinton's potential health issues than his.\n\nBornstein may have violated the law by talking to the Times."}

{"text": "What do you get if you take the Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga 13, shrink the screen, scoop out the Intel Ivy Bridge processor and Windows 8 operating system and replace it with an NVIDIA Tegra 3 CPU and Windows RT?\n\nYou get the Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga 11 — a Windows RT tablet which will be available in December for $799 and up.\n\nLike its 13 inch sibling, the Yoga 11 gets its name from its flexible hinge. You can use the computer in laptop mode. Or you can push the screen back until its resting on on the base of the computer, letting you pick up the device and use it like a tablet.\n\nThat should be a little easier to do with the smaller model since it's thinner and lighter than the Yoga 13 — although it's not nearly as light as a tablet that doesn't have a keyboard attached.\n\nThe IdeaPad Yoga 11 measures 11.7″ x 8″ x 0.6″ and weighs about 2.8 pounds. It features an 11.6 inch, 1366 x 768 pixel display, a 5-point capacitive multitouch touchscreen, up to 2GB of RAM and up to 64GB of storage.\n\nThe device has 2 USB 2.0 ports, 802.11n WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, and stereo speakers. Lenovo says the Yoga 11 will get up to 13 hours of battery life.\n\nIt runs Windows RT, which is basically Windows 8 for computers with ARM-based processors. That means you'll be able to run Windows apps distributed through the Windows Store — but you won't be able to run older Windows apps designed for computers with x86 processors unless they've been updated to support ARM-based chips like the quad-core NVIDIA Tegra 3 processor.\n\nThat could make the $799 starting price a bit tough for some to swallow, but the Yoga 11 brings more to the table than most Windows RT tablets thanks to the built-in keyboard and large battery, both of which are included in the base price."}

Gates may still play an active role at the Redmond, Wash.-based company that he founded in 1975, depending on the wishes of the board and new CEO, said the people.\n\nNadella emerged as one of the stronger candidates to replace departing CEO Steve Ballmer weeks ago, people familiar with the search have said. The plans aren't finalized, said the people.\n\nThompson, who is heading the CEO search, wrote in a blog post last month that the board plans to complete a search for CEO in the \"early part of 2014.\" He said the board started with more than 100 candidates and has since narrowed the list. Ballmer said last August that he planned to retire within a year.\n\nFrank Shaw, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to comment.\n\nThe company also considered internal candidates including Executive Vice President Tony Bates and Chief Operating Officer Kevin Turner.

{"text": "HTC has been experimenting with alternative revenue streams lately, and it was already walking a fine line. Ads started showing up in BlinkFeed a few weeks ago, but users could disable them. Now a large number of One M8 and M9 users have been served an ad in the notification shade. It was promoting a Fantastic Four movie theme, and people are not happy at all.\n\nThe notification appears to have come from Sense Home, and it was served to a large number of users. It wasn't everyone, but I suspect it was targeted at US users. The notification links to the theme store page for the new Fantastic Four theme, but the image does say \"In theaters 8/7/15.\" Let's be honest here, this is an ad, and HTC probably made money for showing it to people. I'm sure HTC would tell you it's a suggested theme or something, but no. HTC has never pushed a suggested theme notification before that I'm aware of.\n\nSeeing ads is an unavoidable part of using a smartphone, but they're usually in apps. The notification shade has traditionally been sacrosanct. In fact, Google's rules forbid ad spamming in notifications. I think that's the part people are having a hard time getting over. An obvious analog to this is Samsung's Avengers themes, which ship pre-installed on the Galaxy S6. However, simply having it available is different than pushing a notification out of the blue.\n\nHTC will probably issue a statement of some sort, saying that it's just testing things and it wants all One users to have a great experience blah, blah, blah. Whatever. The point is HTC should have been smart enough to know how this would look. Someone should have realized this would upset people, and the last thing HTC needs to do right now is upset people who buy its phones. Also, the theme is mega-ugly.\n\nAlternative tags: [High Tension Content], [Hold The Crap], [Hurt The Company]"}

The game is free-to-play and available right now on Xbox 360, Xbox One and PlayStation 4. However, what about the Switch? Is there any chance of a port of the game to Nintendo's hybrid console? It seems, that there is indeed, although there are some warnings about it. Speaking in an interview published by GamesTM (#191), Wargaming's Senior Game Designer Darold Higa told: \"Everybody is asking me this question, and it is not like we do not have many Switches in the office. Because World of Tanks is free-to-play and because we do not have an 'in' on that ecosystem we have to see what the install base is. It has to reach a certain install base before we can include it [in our plans]. The way it works is that, because we are not selling a retail product, we do need a large number of players to support the cost of implementing the platform. It is more just a question of; we have to have an economically viable product. That is why we have to watch the numbers real closely, and the executive team is always keeping track.\" Still, could it even run on the hardware? It seems that it is not much of an issue. \"Our engineers would spend the time to make it work. However, that is the thing; we have to make sure that we have enough budget to make sure that they can spend the time to make it work. After all, the game launched on Xbox 360 in 2014, so there's a good chance the Nintendo Switch can handle it. Let's not forget either, that World of Tanks also recently got the first single player/two player narrative driven mission from the War Stories expansion, which is going to be exclusive to consoles. The game will be updated to fully support the Xbox One X when it launches on November 7th."}

The virus is usually mild with symptoms lasting several days to a week. However, there is thought to be a link between the virus and a rise in cases of microcephaly – a birth defect, which causes abnormal smallness of the head in babies – in the affected countries.\n\n\"Now that we know Zika virus can be transmitted through sex, this increases our awareness campaign in educating the public about protecting themselves and others,\" said Zachary Thompson, DCHHS director, to NBC. \"Next to abstinence, condoms are the best prevention method against any sexually-transmitted infections.\"\n\nThere is currently no medication or vaccine for Zika virus.\n\nOfficials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last week that the evidence of the disease spreading via sexual intervourse is insufficient to warn all travelers, not just pregnant woman, of the potential danger.\n\nDr. Márcio Nehab, a pediatrician and infectious disease specialist at Fiocruz, a research institute in Rio de Janeiro, told The New York Times: \"At the moment we need to be more concerned with the mosquito, the vector known for transmitting the virus.\""}

His comments follow the formal announcement earlier this week of HBO Now, a $14.95/month standalone streaming plan to be made available exclusively through Apple starting next month.\n\n\"The days of the 500 channel universe are over,\" declared Moonves. Although cable and satellite distributors have been \"skeptical\" of standalone streaming and a la carte offerings, he acknowledged, \"there's been a bit of interest\" lately. \"I think the floodgate is now open.\" He added that he has already been in conversations with \"the normal suspects\" about standalone Showtime streaming.\n\nUnder the current model, TV viewers who want Showtime have to add it on top of a cable package. As a result, even if all they want is a legal way to watch Penny Dreadful, they wind up paying for lots of channels they have no interest in. Consumers have been demanding more tailored options for some time, and with these recent developments at HBO and Showtime it looks like we're finally getting them.\n\nMoonves has been interested in standalone streaming for some time. Last fall the company launched CBS All Access, a similar service that provides live and classic CBS content for $5.99/month. According to Moonves, it is doing \"extremely well.\" He also stated last year that a Showtime streaming offering was \"fairly definitively\" coming in 2015, so when he says \"not-too-distant future\" he probably means within the next 10 months.\n\n[Sources: Deadline, Vulture]"}

We know that water rats were slaughtered, because one appears in a photo like a trophy laid out at the front of a pile of deceased rodents.\n\nBut these guys are the goodies, says Professor Banks, who is investigating whether the large rodents could be used to help control pest-rats.\n\n'Theory tells us that wherever you've got an intact biodiversity, it's going to be robust to invasive species. So if we can make and understand what makes for a robust native fauna, I think we can understand how we can control these [pest] rats.'"}

He was trapped in a forcefield in their house down a cellar and the forcefield was powered by a teddy bear with a tape player in its back. The forcefield would turn off if the tape player wasn't switched at a certain time of each day and Jermaine used a watch as an alarm to quickly slide down the cellar and flip the tape back.\n\nIn the end of the episode \"Jermaine,\" Bryce manages to escape the forcefield and rips the face of the teddy bear. He then walks away with Jermaine as they have a conversation indicating that they might be frenemies.\n\nIn \"Abstract,\" Jake discovers that Bryce is now Jermaine's art dealer. He accuses Bryce of using his demon ways to get Jermaine to turn his back on painting landscapes, but Jermaine reveals he just got tired of landscapes and wanted to paint abstracts instead.\n\nAppearance\n\nBryce is a huge blue creature with narrow yellow eyes and a wide mouth. He walks on four legs and is in fact a demon as Jake said in \"Abstract.\"\n\nPersonality\n\nBryce has a very wild personality and a hate towards Joshua for allegedly stealing his poster. At times, Bryce dislikes Jermaine as seen in the episode \"Jermaine,\" where Bryce told Jermaine that he would eat him if he escaped.\n\nHowever, he was surprised when Jermaine told he'd have released him if he didn't threaten him. This caused him to offer to be friends if he let Bryce out of the forcefield though he was quick to go back to threatening after Jermaine refused.\n\nHe also has a very smug personality and always thinks that whatever he does is cool. He seems have negativity in him too if things don't go his way."}
{"text": "What, exactly, is mom?\n\nQuick answer: mom is a flexible typesetting and document formatting package that allows you to create high-quality Portable Document Format (.pdf) or PostScript (.ps) files for viewing and printing. Helpful, eh? Read on.\n\nA bit of history\n\nMom is a macro set that sits on top of groff, a robust text processing system that first saw light of day at the Bell AT&T labs in the 1970s. Originally called roff, then nroff, and later, troff, with the advent of Richard Stallman's GNU Free Software (which later became one half of GNU/Linux—what most people now just call Linux), troff was re-written and released freely to the public as GNU troff, or, more simply, groff.\n\nAlmost forty years in development—that's a long time to iron out the bugs. And groff is still being actively maintained by a community of groff gurus.\n\nAll Greek to you?\n\nThe terms text processing and macro set may be unfamiliar to you. Text processing is a method of creating documents that separates the content of what you're writing from its presentation, much like html. Working in a text editor, you intersperse documents with instructions describing how you'd like the text to look. When a document prepared this way is intended for processing with groff, the instructions are called macros.\n\nMacros serve one of two functions: they're either directions for particular typographic effects—say, increasing the size of type or changing the font—or they indicate the semantic role a particular bit of writing plays within the document (e.g. whether it's a heading or a paragraph or a footnote).\n\nIn the latter capacity, there's no need to specify the look of a document's semantic elements. That's taken care of behind-the-scenes, either according to default specifications or via formatting instructions given elsewhere in the document—again, much like html."}

Collaborating with a local Speyside craft brewer, Brian created a bold and zesty India Pale Ale beer to imbue Glenfiddich's rich oak casks with extra hoppy notes. The experiment resulted in the first single malt Scotch whisky ever finished in craft India Pale Ale casks.\n\nGlenfiddich Project XX\n\nTheir second experiment of the series took place privately at Glenfiddich's Conval warehouse. Shrouded in secrecy, Malt Master Brian Kinsman invited 20 whisky experts from around the world to select any expression of their choosing from the thousands of stacked casks. The final 20 chosen malts, matured in everything from port pipes to virgin bourbon barrels, have created an unusual, innovative and unexpected whisky, one that has exceeded even Glenffidich's expectations.\n\n--\n\nThere will also be tasting guides by one of Glenfiddich's very own Brand Ambassadors, as well as a door prize that you definitely don't want to miss out on.

Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports\n\nToday, at the UFC 169 Fight Club Q & A hosted by Jon Jones, the Light Heavyweight champion spoke about his upcoming schedule. Jones, who is set to defend his title against Glover Teixeira at UFC 172 in Baltimore, stated that after Glover he expects to face off against Alexander Gustafsson in a rematch. After that bout, he expects to fight Daniel Cormier.\n\nThis is obviously a bold statement from Jones, as you rarely see fighters predicting their next bouts. Most of the time a fighter will respond to a 'what's next' question with the standard 'I am focused on my upcoming opponent'. While Jon did admit he is focused on Glover, he could not help but to predict his upcoming foes.\n\nFor his schedule to come to fruition a lot of pieces must first fall in place. At UFC Fight Night 37, Alexander Gustafsson will face off against the rising undefeated prospect, Jimi Manuwa, in the main event of the evening. Gus has to get passed Manuwa in order to fight Jones again. If Gus does beat Manuwa, expect a monumental rematch sometime late in 2014.\n\nAs for Cormier, he faces former Light Heavyweight champion, Rashad Evans, at UFC 170 in his first drop down to Light Heavyweight. Cormier faces a stiff test in Evans, and even with a victory will likely have to wait on the sidelines if Gus defeats Manuwa.\n\nOf course, this is all dependent on Jon Jones actually defending his title against Glover at UFC 172. Glover packs a lot of power into his punches, and is arguably the strongest hitter Jon has faced. We will soon find out is Jon Jones is as good a prophet as a fighter."}

A recent autopsy study found higher levels in the brains of Parkinson's victims of PCBs found in Monsanto's Aroclor, which was banned in 1979, but still pollutes the world. And, the more PCBs found in the brain, the worse the brain damage. The worst three appeared to be PCBs appeared to be numbers 138, 153, and 180—the levels of all of which are significantly lower in the bodies of those eating plant-based diets.\n\nSo: \"Does a vegan diet reduce risk [of] Parkinson's disease?\" Good question. Well, we know that every single prospective study on dairy products or milk and Parkinson's disease tended to find increased risk. It may be that \"dairy products in the United States are contaminated with neurotoxic chemicals.\" There's substantial evidence suggesting that \"exposure to pesticides may increase Parkinson's disease risk,\" and autopsies found higher levels of pollutants and pesticides in the brains of Parkinson's disease patients, and some of these toxins are present at low levels in dairy products.\n\nThey're talking about toxins like tetrahydroisoquinoline, a Parkinsonism-related compound found predominantly in cheese. Although the amounts of this neurotoxin—even in cheese—are not really high, the concern is that the chemical may accumulate in the brain over long periods of consumption.\n\nPlease consider volunteering to help out on the site."}

But a court ruled that calling her New Zealand neighbour an Australian was racist and against the law.\n\nCzech-born Mills, 31, has been found guilty of racially aggravated public disorder after a rant at her New Zealand-born neighbour in Macclesfield, south of Manchester.\n\n\nChelsea O'Reilly, who has dual British and New Zealand citizenship, said: \"She called me a stupid fat Australian b****. Because of my accent there can be some confusion over my nationality. She knew I was from New Zealand.\n\n\n\"She was trying to be offensive. I was really insulted. She said she would kill my dog. Bizarrely she then blew raspberries at me like a child.\"\n\n\nThe incident happened when O'Reilly was giving a statement to police about a domestic incident between Mills and Mills' husband in early September, the Daily Mail reported.\n\n\nMills, who had called the police after running from her house, had stormed over to O'Reilly's house and began screaming at her.\n\n\nTwo police constables told the court they had heard Mills use the word \"Australian\" during her drunken rant.\n\n\nAt Macclesfield magistrates' court Mills agreed she had shouted but denied she was being racist.\n\n\n\"I did not use the word 'Australian'. I used to live with an Australian person. She was very nice.\"\n\nBut chairman of the bench Brian Donohue said: \"You were in an emotional and inebriated state. The word 'Australian' was used. It was racially aggravated and the main reason it was used was in hostility.\"\n\nMills denied the charge of racially aggravated public disorder but was found guilty and fined £110. She admitted assaulting a police constable by kicking him in the shin and knee and was fined £200 on that charge. She was also ordered to pay both victims £50 compensation, and £500 court costs.\n\nMills and her husband moved to Scotland after the incident."}

Namely, as Stephen Colbert pointed out last night, Donald J. Trump will enter office as the least popular president-elect in modern history, while his predecessor has a seat at the head of the cool kids' table.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n\"But hey,\" Colbert quipped, \"It's not a popularity contest—and neither was the election.\"\n\nTrump's 40 percent favorability rating—a CBS poll actually has it as low as 32 percent—is 39 points below President-elect Obama's in 2009. (\"If America's known for anything,\" Colbert grinned, \"It's giving black men the benefit of the doubt.\") It's also 20 points behind Obama right now, three months after Trump won an election that was supposedly a referendum on Obama's eight years in office. In that same CBS poll, 62 percent of Americans said they approved of how Obama had handled his job of president, while a CNN poll, also out today, has it at 60 percent. That 62 number is the third highest among outgoing presidents since 1981, behind Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan, tied at 68.\n\nAgain, right now, 60 percent of Americans approve of President Obama, while only 40 percent of Americans approve of President-elect Donald Trump.\n\n\"Now, when Trump saw these dismal polls, he realized you can't please everybody, and he just got to work for the American people,\" Colbert said, barely holding his deadpan. \"I'm just fucking with you. He of course fired back at reality on Twitter.\"\n\nThe same people who did the phony election polls, and were so wrong, are now doing approval rating polls. They are rigged just like before. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 17, 2017\n\nOf course, national polls had Clinton winning a few percent more of the popular vote. Which she did."}

Like salmon, they are diadromous, which means they split their life cycle between salt water and fresh water. Each spring they return from the ocean to \"run\" up Long Island's tributaries to spawn in fresh water. Unfortunately, dams and culverts have restricted their access to most of this important habitat.\n\nSeatuck is working with partners across the region to improve access and restore local populations of these ecologically important fish. The Long Island Volunteer River Herring Survey - organized by Seatuck, the Long Island Sound Study and Peconic Estuary Program - aims to find the tributaries where \"remnant\" runs of river herring still exist and then to monitior the size and timing of those runs.\n\nParticipants in the survey are asked to commit to surveying a local tributary from mid-March through mid-May. The survey protocol involves visiting a neighborhood river or stream and spending 15 minutes looking for alewife or signs of their presence. The visits can occur daily, weekly or as often as possible. All data is good data - the more trained eyes we have on our tributaries, the better. Observations and information from the survey visit is then submitted through a easty-to-use form on your computer or mobile device and automatically becomes part of our study.\n\nFINAL Training Session:\n\nThursday, March 15, 6:00 - 7:00, Scully Estate, Islip - RSVP/Info: This email address is being protected from spambots.

{"text": "One of our MMO readers, Juan Manuel, shared an update on Wilmer Flores who is playing Winter Ball in Venezuela:\n\nWilmer Flores, fresh off a stint at the conditioning camp with Mr. Barwis, has returned to the Venezuelan Winter League. In his first three games he has 5 hits in 14 at-bats with a home run, two RBIs, and two runs scored with a 971 OPS. Small sample for sure, but he has hit the ground running. Something curious also, last year Flores hit better when playing anywhere but SS. In his first three games he played third base twice going 4-for-8 with his HR, 2 RBI and 2 runs scored, his game at shortstop saw him going 1-for-6. As I said small samples, but I will monitor this the rest of the offseason and see if he continues to produce more at the plate when playing anywhere other than SS.\n\nIt's going to be interesting to see how this Flores situation ultimately plays out. Will he be our Opening Day shortstop? Or second baseman? Or will he be dealt?\n\nFlores has been impressing Mets brass with how hard he's working on his agility and fitness during the team's off-season conditioning program in Port St. Lucie.\n\nSandy Alderson said recently: \"I'm one of those people that says put him out there and see what can happen, which is why we played him so much last year.\"\n\n\"I think the issue has always been whether he can play defensively adequately or better,\" Alderson said. \"And a lot of us think he has the ability or the potential to do that.\"\n\nBut then again, I'm wondering if Alderson is just blowing smoke in light of the fact that he continues to work the shortstop market and is reportedly checking in with some teams daily.\n\nNevertheless, the 23-year old Flores keeps doing what he does at the plate and few doubt he's going to be a very productive major leaguer. 2015 could be his breakthrough season."}

Local and federal law enforcement agencies will offer between $50 and $300 in gas coupons for each qualifying handgun or assault weapon that is turned in during the program's hours of operation.\n\nMayor \"Kip\" Holden said the program allows residents to safely dispose of firearms and ammunition that they no longer want in their homes while minimizing the threat that the dangerous items could fall into the wrong hands. The mayor also pointed out that every year, crimes are committed with unsecured guns that have been stolen or used without the owners' permission.\n\nBRAVE's Gas for Guns programs in August of last year collected 53 handguns, 12 rifles and 8 shotguns. They gave out a total of $5,350 in Circle K gas cards.\n\nDuring the exchange program, any functional, non-replica pistol or revolver smaller that 0.380 caliber can be exchanged for gas cards totaling $50. Pistols that are .0380 caliber or greater can be traded for gas cards totaling $100 in value, and the program will pay $300 in gas cards for \"assault style\" rifles. The program defines these weapons as a functional variant of an automatic or semi-automatic rifle that is currently in use by military forces with a caliber of 9 mm, 7.62 mm or 5.56 mm. Other firearms that are ineligible for gas coupon exchange can also be dropped off at the program site for safe disposal."}

The statement said the Russian pilot ignored Estonia's air traffic control despite its responders being switched on.\n\nThere have been regular squabbles between the Nato alliance and Russia in the Baltic region, which is close to the Russian border.

{"text": "A baseball detective attempts to solve a homicide cold case.\n\nWith his statistics-driven \"abstracts,\" James (The Bill James Handbook: Baseball Info Solutions, 2017, etc.) is famous for revolutionizing the way fans look at baseball. Here, the author and his daughter deliver a provocative book that employs his prodigious research techniques in an effort to solve a famous, 100-year-old mass murder case. Murders, actually, as their research on this case led them to a startling conclusion. On June 9, 1912, in Villisca, Iowa, a family of eight was brutally murdered with an ax at night in their home. No one was ever convicted. James believed other, similar mass murders might have occurred around the same time: \"And then I found one, and another one, and another one. I hired my daughter as a researcher, and then she started finding them.\" The authors' research uncovered at least a dozen similar murders from 1909 to 1912 that occurred from Virginia to Oregon to Kansas, 48 murders in all. They kept digging and found a few dozen more during the period 1900 to 1906, with the locations ranging from Nova Scotia to Arkansas to Florida. The authors became convinced they were committed by one person. The murderer's modus operandi revealed a pattern: he worked for a living, probably in mining or logging, committed the crimes on weekends with an ax, often burning down the house, and didn't steal anything. Since the murders were always close to train lines, the authors figured he traveled by train. Eventually, they came up with a suspect. They include detailed discussions of investigative techniques back then and stories about people wrongly (they feel) executed for the crimes. Told in workmanlike, journalistic prose with plenty of personal injections—\"hear me out. Have I got a story to tell you\"—the narrative becomes addictive, and it's easy to get caught up in the elaborate search and the authors' conclusions, which are plausible.\n\nFans of true crime—as well as detectives in homicide bureaus—will relish this book."}

Of course, what we don't know right now – and what could be considered a major spoiler if we did – is how exactly Kal-El is going to return. There are plenty of theories of course, but this is one mystery that we may have to wait until next November to learn more about.\n\nMORE NEWS FROM THE WEB\n\nThat being said, with Justice League currently shooting in England, a few details are starting to trickle out. Today's bit of news isn't much, but a photo shared by Cavill during a recent workout seemingly indicates that Superman will be sporting a look similar to what you see in the photos in the gallery above. It may not seem like a big deal, but Justice League could feature the first big screen bearded Man of Steel. Another possibility of course is that Cavill simply hasn't started filming his scenes yet, and if that's the case, his character may not have a very big role in the movie.\n\nWhat significance, if any, this will end up having in the film itself obviously remains to be seen, but if this is the route that they're choosing to go down for the character's appearance in Justice League, we'd be all for it.\n\nIn any case, check out the photos above and let us know if you're digging this potential new look for Supes."}

The innovation, which is 100% electric, is also a 100% of Moroccan origin in terms of concept and assembly.\n\nThe creation, which took nine months to complete, was revealed at SNTL's center of technology and innovation \"Tamayuz Supply Chain\", in Marrakesh. The center chose and accompanied Engima, the Moroccan consulting firm specializing in automotive engineering, to work on the development and manufacturing of the electric pickup's design.\n\nThe electric vehicle prototype, which was adapted to fit the Moroccan market, does not require the creation of electric stations for it to be recharged. The pickup can be recharged in less than 7 hours at the comfort of one's home using a 220V power outlet, or in a mere hour if a supercharger is used.\n\nThe vehicle's rechargeable batteries are placed in a balanced manner on the chassis allowing more stability and an autonomy of 180 to 200km. The designers of the vehicle claim that it is perfectly suited for urban journeys, with frequent stops, during which its speed can reach 129km/h and its rear bed can bear up to 800kg of load.\n\nHowever, the most highlighted element of this innovation is that the users of the electric pickup truck can easily upgrade their vehicles without having to purchase a new one. The modular design allows to integrate a new version of a component on an earlier version of the vehicle, without it hindering any of its normal functions.\n\nTo top it off, the electric pickup and its features, such as temperature control that could harm or spoil transported goods, can be remotely controlled by the driver using an all in one tablet.\n\nAlthough designed, manufactured, and assembled in Morocco, the electric pickup innovation is intended to be primarily sold in the European market while Morocco, until it is fully ready, will only be acting as a carrier market."}

{"text": "State labor law exempts federal, state or municipal employees from minimum wage requirements, but Mr. Cuomo's office said he would act on his own through his Division of Budget, directing the initial wage increases taking effect at the end of year. He would also seek to change the labor law in the coming legislative session, which begins in January, to prevent future governors from using executive powers to roll back the wages. Mr. Cuomo will be up for re-election in 2018, at the end of which the $15 rate will be put into effect in New York City.\n\nThe job categories affected by the plan include lifeguards, office assistants and custodial staff, some of which are seasonal. Wages in New York City would be raised first, administration officials said, because of its higher cost of living.\n\nThe notion of a statewide $15 minimum wage for all employees, public and private, has faced resistance from Republicans in Albany, and some conservative fiscal groups, who warn it would be disastrous for the state's economy and job growth. On Tuesday, Senator John J. Flanagan of Long Island, the Republican leader in the State Senate, had no comment on the governor's decision.\n\nMr. Cuomo's announcement was met with an enthusiastic response from labor leaders like George Gresham, the president of 1199 S.E.I.U., the nation's largest health care workers union, who applauded the governor's action. Mr. Gresham said it could potentially set a $15-an-hour standard of pay for tens of thousands of the union's home-care workers, \"who do this important work, but who are not necessarily state employees.\"\n\nThe announcement prompted the city's public advocate, Letitia A. James, to call for a $15 minimum wage for city employees. A spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, a fellow Democrat and frequent sparring partner of Mr. Cuomo's, noted that the city had already promised its lowest paid workers more than $12 an hour in 2016, while the governor's plan would accelerate past that level only at the end of 2017."}

{"text": "Doxorubicin is a chemotherapeutic agent successfully used in the treatment of a wide range of cancers. However, with cumulative doses, doxorubicin also is known to have cardiotoxic effects, including cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Identification and quantification of myocardial cell damage has been a point of Controversy. We sought to identify these changes by measuring the levels of troponin I both 24 and 48 hr after the administration of doxorubicin as part of an antineoplastic treatment regimen. Thirty-eight patients scheduled to undergo treatment with doxorubicin were screened and approached for enrollment in the study. Thirty-one of them fulfilled all the inclusion criteria and also signed informed consent. All the patients enrolled in the study had blood drawn before the administration of doxorubicin and also 24 and 48 hr later. Electrocardiograms were performed prior to and 48 hr following the administration of chemotherapy. The dose of doxorubicin administered was calculated by the oncologist and ranged from 450 mg/m2-650 mg/m2 (mean 520 mg/m2). Only one patient was found to have en elevation of troponin levels both 24 and 48 hr (2.3 ng/mL and 2.1 ng/mL, respectively) after the administration of the drug. During that time, the patient denied any chest pain, shortness of breath or palpitations. Repeat ECG did not show any changes from the baseline. The remaining participants continued to maintain a troponin level of less than 0.3 ng/mL during the follow-up. In these patients, no electrocardiographic changes were noted in the follow-up ECG compared to the baseline; however, a slight drop in the ejection fraction without any impact on the clinical presentation was recorded. We concluded that the cTnl level does not change after the administration of doxorubicin, and thus cannot be used as a predictor of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity."}

There is an atmosphere of fear of intimidation. That only gets worse when there are terrorist attacks. At the moment there is an increasing problem of Islamophobia, with women becoming an increasing target,\" Qureshi added.\n\nRises in reported hate crimes are presented in the media as evidence that Britain is in the grip of an \"epidemic of hate\", and are used by bodies like the UN and NGOs like Human Rights Watch to demand politicians keep quiet on issues such as immigration.\n\nHowever, a key pillar of the UK government's strategy against hate crime is to raise the number of reports.

{"text": "One of the more common refrains during America's nearly ever-present campaign season is that this election, this year, is the most important of our lives. We documented this in July, noting that it was first used in one form or another back in 1856, but has been common since at least 1980. Why is each election most important? Well, that's often a bit more nebulous.\n\nAccording to a new survey from PRRI and The Atlantic, we can describe one way in which voters in 2016 felt this was the most important election in history. Forty-one percent of respondents – including two-thirds of those who voted for Donald Trump – felt that the 2016 election was critical because it was our last chance to \"stop America's decline.\"\n\nThe fraction of Hillary Clinton voters who agreed with that sentiment was much smaller, at only a fifth.\n\nTrump himself positioned this election as a final opportunity for his party, at one point telling the Christian Broadcasting Network's David Brody that 2016 was \"the last election that the Republicans have a chance of winning\" — in part thanks to shifting demographics. The idea of decline clearly also overlaps with the motto embroidered into his hats. America was once great; it no longer is; Trump will reverse that. The decline will stop.\n\nResponses to the question also correlate to age and economic status. Older Americans were more likely to agree with the sentiment, as were members of the white working class.\n\nThe net result of the election is that those voters who were worried about the decline of the United States are now among the most optimistic about the next four years. About 28 percent of Americans think the quality of life in their local communities will improve under Trump – but more than half of members of the white working class who voted for Trump think that it will. In other words, for now at least, Trump's core base of support felt that this was an unusually important election – and that the results stopped what they perceived as the worst-case scenario.\n\nFeatured Image: EPA\n\n(c) 2016, The Washington Post · Philip Bump"}

But HAL wasn't always a HAL. In fact, in earlier drafts of the script HAL was named Athena and had a woman's voice.\n\nThe Computer History Museum has some early sketches of the spaceship where Athena is described. \"The computer maintains a \"log\" of the journey, making its own entries plus those of Bowman, which he records verbally. The computer takes verbal instructions and replies through a \"speech synthesizer\" (female voice).\"\n\nEventually, Athena turned into HAL—a mashup of the words heuristic and algorithmic, the two main types of computer learning. (HAL is not, according to Kubrick, a simple cypher for IBM, as film lore has it.) In the French version of the movie, HAL is named CARL, Cerveau Analytique de Recherche et de Liaison (Analytic Brain for Research and Communication). In the final movie, HAL was voiced by Douglas Rain—a Canadian actor known mostly for his stage work.\n\nHAL isn't the first movie character to change genders. Ripley from Alien was supposed to be a man, as was Starbuck in Battlestar Galactica. Luke Skywalker was once a woman (and Han Solo a lizard man).

He's not bad by any stretch and he took some big steps last season without Megatron. I'd actually say last season was his best season. Without his security blanket he had to be a real QB and he showed he can do it.\n\nI still don't know if he's worth the highest contract in NFL history.

He's not very efficient. He throws the ball a lot to get those high numbers.

{"text": "Numerous studies have shown functional links between the cannabinoid and opioid systems. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether acute treatments by endogenous cannabinoid agonist, selective CB1 or CB2 receptor antagonists modulate the expression of mu- (MOR) and delta- (DOR) opioid receptor mRNA levels and functional activity in the cerebellum of transgenic mice deficient in the CB1 type of cannabis receptors. We examined the effect of noladin ether (endogenous cannabinoid agonist) pretreatment on MOR and DOR mRNA expression by using reverse transcription and real-time polimerase chain reaction (PCR) and the ability of subsequent application of the opioid agonists to activate G-proteins, as measured by [35S]GTPgammaS binding, in wild-type (CB1+/+) and CB1 cannabinoid receptor deficient (CB1-/-, 'knockout', K.O.) mice. The acute administration of noladin ether markedly reduced MOR-mediated G-protein activation and caused a significant increase in the level of MOR mRNAs in the cerebella of wildtype, but not in the CB1-/- mice. No significant differences were observed in DOR functional activity and mRNA expression in wild-type animals. In CB1-/- mice the expression of DOR mRNA increased after noladin ether treatment, but no changes were found in DOR functional activity. In addition, Rimonabant (selective central cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist) and SR144528 (selective peripheral cannabinoid CB2 receptor antagonist) caused significant potentiation in MOR functional activity in the wild-type animals, whereas DOR mediated G-protein activation was increased in the CB1-/- mice. In contrast, Rimonabant and SR144528 decreased the MOR and DOR mRNA expressions in both CB1+/+ and CB1-/- mice. Taken together, these results indicate that acute treatment with cannabinoids causes alterations in MOR and DOR mRNA expression and functional activity in the cerebella of wild-type and CB1 knockout mice indicating indirect interactions between these two signaling systems."}
{"text": "Bitcoin has been going strong since the past few weeks. The cryptocurrency which was priced at around $640 in mid-October has surged past the $700 mark and now stands at $725, after falling to $690 briefly over the weekend. At the current pace, the price of Bitcoin reaching $800 is imminent.\n\nAs to the reason behind the recent increase in price, the largest since June 2016 is the constant demand for Bitcoin in the Chinese market. Lately, China has been witnessing an increased capital outflow despite strict capital controls. According to available data, the country is leaking money for over two straight years due to weakening yuan. China's foreign exchange reserves are said to be plummeting at a drastic pace as more people rush to buying foreign assets.\n\nMost of the capital outflows are attributed to two factors: one, where the exporters from the mainland are keeping their money in offshore, and the other where people are buying Bitcoin to prevent their assets from depreciating with yuan; and also for cross-border investments and transactions.\n\nWith an estimated total of over $573.2 billion in the capital outflow from China this year (Citigroup Global Markets' estimate), the half yearly numbers stood at around $286 billion. If the actual figures are in any way going to match the estimated numbers, then the demand for alternate currencies like Bitcoin is expected to only go up during the last two months of 2016.\n\nLast month, Goldman Sachs warned China stating that the country's outflows may be worse than it appears to be. As yuan hit a 6-year low in October, the country continues to tighten its capital controls which may have driven not just the individuals and investors but also corporates to Bitcoin as the fear of depreciation looms over Chinese yuan.\n\nThe continued increase in demand for Bitcoin from various segments of the Chinese population will continue to reflect in the upward movement of the digital currency's price. It is just a matter of time before Bitcoin reaches $800 mark.\n\nRef: WSJ |CNBC | Forbes | Bloomberg |Image: NewsBTC | Charts: CoinMarketCap | Trading Economics"}

{"text": "In a breather for Indian IT firms, the \"discriminatory\" USD 2,000 H-1B fee mostly imposed on them has now lapsed in a Republican-majority US Congress.\n\n\nThe charges, often called outsourcing fee, had forced Indian IT companies in the last few years to pay millions of dollars towards protecting the US-Mexican border from illegal immigration.\n\n\nIndian firms had described the fee on highly-qualified IT professionals coming to the US on a H-1B visa as \"discriminatory.\"\n\n\nThe legislation with regard to a USD 2,000 fee on H-1B visas for companies having more than 50 per cent of its employees oversees was adopted by the US Congress in 2010 mainly at the instance of a group of lawmakers led by Senator Charles Schumer.\n\n\nPassed on August 10, the law contains provision to hike H-1B and L-1 Visa fee per application by USD 2,000 and USD 2,250 respectively for qualifying firm; which mainly targeted Indian IT companies.\n\n\nThe duration of law was extended from four to five years under James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010 to provide healthcare and financial compensation for the firefighters and other 'First Responders' who helped out in the aftermath of the 9/11 attack.\n\n\nIn a report released last month, NASSCOM said Indian tech industry contributed an estimated over USD 375 million during this period to the US Treasury including helping America secure its borders.\n\n\nIn a recent interview, NASSCOM president R Chandrashekhar described the fee as unjustified. \"It had nothing to do with the IT industry.

{"text": "New statistical analysis of mini-spiral galaxies suggests dark matter mimics the organization of regular matter, a phenomenon the Standard Model of physics fails to predict. Photo by SISSA\n\nTRIESTE, Italy, Dec. 15 (UPI) -- In a recent survey of mini-spiral galaxies, astronomers found a unexpected relationship between dark and light matter. The relationship is easy to measure yet impossible to explain using the Standard Model of physics.\n\nResearchers from Italy's International School for Advanced Studies conducted a statistical analysis of three dozen mini-spiral galaxies. Their work revealed a strong correlation between the organization of dark and regular matter in each galaxy.\n\nIf, for example, ordinary matter was condensed at the center of a mini-spiral galaxy, so too was dark matter. If the bulk of regular matter was scattered across the outskirts of the galaxy, so too was dark matter.\n\n\"We studied 36 galaxies, which was a sufficient number for statistical study,\" Paolo Salucci, an astrophysicist at SISSA, said in a news release. \"By doing this, we found a link between the structure of ordinary, or luminous matter like stars, dust and gas, with dark matter.\"\n\nRELATED Hubble captures confused identity of Virgo galaxy\n\nThe Standard Model assumes most dark matter consists of non-baryonic or weakly interacting massive particles.\n\n\"It would not interact with ordinary matter except through gravitational force,\" explained Ekaterina Karukes, who recently earned her PhD at SISSA. \"Our observations, however, disagree with this notion.\"\n\nThe strong correlation between the organization of dark and regular matter in mini-spiral galaxies undermines the assumptions of the Standard Model. The discovery demands a new model of physics.\n\n\"This can be a starting point for exploring this new kind of physics,\" said Salucci. \"These 36 items are the tip of the iceberg of a phenomenon that we will probably find everywhere and that will help us discover what we cannot yet see. \"\n\nThe scientists shared their findings in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society."}

{"text": "Pedro Martinez, Boston Red Sox\n\nImage Source A Baseball with 216 raised red stitches hits the air and curves right under the batter, and the batter swings. Why did the ball drop? Why did the batter swing? What exactly happens to the ball as it is thrown? What happens to the ball depends on what spin was put on it. What causes the ball to curve, slide or stay in a strait pattern? This all has to do with the fact that there is drag force, or air resistance. A curve ball is created when a ball is spinning. The faster flowing air under the ball creates less pressure, which forces the ball to dive or break. Baseball would be a dull game without drag force because there would be no curves, sliders, or knuckle balls.\n\nImage Source\n\n\nImage Source\n\nTwisiting Motion of the wrist to cause a curve ball\n\nImage Source So how exactly do pitchers throw the curve balls? They grasp the ball with the middle and index fingers on or near the stitching, with their thumb underneath. As they throw the ball, they snap their wrist in a turning motion, like turning a door knob, to make the ball spin in the direction of the throw. The stitching on the ball gathers up air as the ball rotates, creating higher air pressure on one side of the ball. The higher velocity difference puts more stress on the air flowing around the bottom of the ball. That stress makes air flowing around the ball \"break away\" from the ball's surface sooner. Conversely, the air at the top of the spinning ball, subject to less stress due to the lower velocity difference and can \"hang onto\" the ball's surface longer before breaking away. Therefore curveballs do most of their curving in the last quarter of their trip. Perception plays a big role in the curve ball: The typical curveball goes through only 3.4 inches of deviation from a straight line drawn between the pitcher's hand and the catcher's glove. However, from the perspective of the pitcher and batter, the ball moves 14.4 inches. This proves that a curve ball really curves.\n\nImage Source"}
{"text": "Big Bear\n\n\nBig Bear was one of Pabst Brewing Company's most beloved 40oz malt liquors, up until 2013 when it got the axe. It was often compared to Olde English 800 because the ABV varied among North America. The east coast had 5.7%, the west coast had 7.5%, and Canada had it in both 8.0% and 7.0% at different times. The first time I found and drank Big Bear was in the very early days of my hunting 40s. It was in the early 2000s and I was going with some friends on a road trip to Montreal when I remembered hearing that Big Bear had been found somewhere in upstate New York. Deciding to try my luck, I stopped at a random gas station (most likely a Stewart's), and went in. As soon as I started opening the door my eyes zeroed in on them in the cooler, the bear growling back at me, but I was not intimidated. The \"east coast\" version of Big Bear was indeed my favorite out of the 3. It flowed like liquid gold each and every time. 10/10 swills. I miss this brand so much it hurts. 40oz Crew member IMT40s was the first to hook me up with the stronger \"west coast\" version. It was excellent as well, the taste not quite as perfect as the east coast one, but the increased buzz compensated for that. At 7.5% it tasted better than many of the other malts in that range at the time. A solid 8/10 swills. The Canadian 8.0% was even stronger and the taste much different from its American counterparts. It reminded me of a cross between Budweiser and Steel Reserve 211 if you can imagine such a thing. The swill was a bit rough, but at 8% it made you feel good. 6/10 swills. I'm sorry my neighbors to the north never got to try Big Bear in its best and purest form.\n\n\nI need the 5 variants pictured on the bottom. If you can help please email me.\n\n\nReviews | Return"}
{"text": "Do you have fond memories of playing the 2005 version of Star Wars: Battlefront 2? Do you wish with every fiber of your being that it had official online servers again? Well then, good news: your wish just came true, somehow.\n\n\nOn both Steam and GOG, the PC version of the original Battlefront 2 has been updated with 64-player online multiplayer support and crossplay, so that you can battle or just front (if you're not good at battling but want people to believe you are) with friends on either platform.\n\n\nWhile Disney, the game's current publisher, didn't say precisely why it decided to do this, odds are good that it's a promotional thing for Star Wars: Battlefront II, EA's new-gen Battlefront game that's coming out next month and having a beta this week. It's a pretty neat promotional thing, though, given how much people adore the first Battlefront 2, which is regarded by some as the best multiplayer Star Wars ever.\n\n\nBattlefront 2's return, however, has so far been less a Return of the Jedi triumph and more an Empire Strikes Back series of unfortunate events. As of now, most players are complaining that they can't actually connect to the new multiplayer servers, likely because they're swamped. This makes sense given that, in the past 24 hours, the game has jumped from having a few hundred concurrent players to thousands.\n\n\nIt's also a bit darkly humorous that Disney decided to resurrect this game ahead of EA's Battlefront II, seeing as it's given rise to a renewed chorus of chants about how much more people liked the first two Battlefront games than EA and DICE's reboot. Here, for instance, is the current top review on the Steam version of Battlefront 2:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSavage. I thought EA's first Battlefront was fine, but I'd be hard-pressed to tell you a single memorable moment from my time with it. Also, it got old fast. Hopefully the new one is better!

{"text": "The recent development of open-source 3-D printers makes scaling of distributed additive-based manufacturing of high-value objects technically feasible and offers the potential for widespread proliferation of mechatronics education and participation. These self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRaps) can manufacture approximately half of their own parts from sequential fused deposition of polymer feedstocks. RepRaps have been demonstrated for conventional prototyping and engineering, customizing scientific equipment, and appropriate technology-related manufacturing for sustainable development. However, in order for this technology to proliferate like 2-D electronic printers have, it must be economically viable for a typical household. This study reports on the life-cycle economic analysis (LCEA) of RepRap technology for an average US household. A new low-cost RepRap is described and the costs of materials and time to construct it are quantified. The economic costs of a selection of 20 open-source printable designs (representing less than 0.02% of those available), are typical of products that a household might purchase, are quantified for print time, energy, and filament consumption and compared to low and high Internet market prices for similar products without shipping costs. The results show that even making the extremely conservative assumption that the household would only use the printer to make the selected 20 products a year the avoided purchase cost savings would range from about $300 to $2000/year. Assuming the 25 h of necessary printing for the selected products is evenly distributed throughout the year these savings provide a simple payback time for the RepRap in 4 months to 2 years and provide an ROI between >200% and >40%. As both upgrades and the components that are most likely to wear out in the RepRap can be printed and thus the lifetime of the distributing manufacturing can be substantially increased the unavoidable conclusion from this study is that the RepRap is an economically attractive investment for the average US household already. It appears clear that as RepRaps improve in reliability, continue to decline in cost and both the number and assumed utility of open-source designs continues growing exponentially, open-source 3-D printers will become a mass-market mechatronic device."}

{"text": "Parrot\n\nParrot is a service that backs up files from a monitored file/directory.\n\n####description\n\nParrot runs as a systemd user service and also as a dbus service. Parrot's dbus service capabilities offer signals and methods that allow you to remotely set up watches to back up files and/or signal on events.\n\nParrot is a systemd user service, being so means that the DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS will not be set to the correct bus address (since none of the environment variables are set in a systemd user instance). To circumvent this, Parrot runs an instance of dbus as a systemd service. There are several files under the systemd directory to set this up. The .socket unit activates the systemd socket for the dbus bus address. The matching .service unit executes the dbus session, while the .conf drop in sets the environment variable bus address name.\n\nThe screenshot above shows an instance of Parrot on d-feet (a dbus utility program). Once a Parrot watch is set on a directory, anytime a file in that directory is opened Parrot will make a backup of that file before any changes occur.

{"text": "Last night, former Athletic Brett Anderson had some choice words for the fans on Twitter. The comments seemed to be directed at A's fans in particular. His tweets have been deleted, but there were some screen grabs up this morning.\n\nThe offending tweets seemed to begin with, \"If your Twitter handle has what position of the field you sit in as a fan…your life is beyond brutal and obsolete.\" After a fan said that Anderson knows how passionate the fans are, Anderson responded with, \"That means 0.\"\n\nThe evening concluded with Brett Anderson tweeting out, \"A lion does not lose sleep over the opinions of sheep.\" That's some pretty high praise for oneself, considering this \"lion\" has made 14 starts in the past 3 years. The player that the A's got in a trade for Anderson this past offseason, Drew Pomeranz, has already made 8 this season. The only ones getting \"fleeced\" here are Anderson's current employers.\n\nBrett Anderson is no lion. Not even the fictional lions of House Lannister would have him. The people that did accept him, those that reside in the right field bleachers in Oakland, have now been slighted by this injury-prone putz. What Brett Anderson has forgotten is that the people that put where they sit in their Twitter handles are generally the people that actually go to the games. The people that supported him over the years, even when he was constantly on the DL.\n\nLet's take a minute to look at the photo of Brett Anderson above. This was taken at the beginning of Spring Training. A day when you get to start playing the game you love, and compete for a championship. Anderson's expression does not match the excitement he should feel. Instead, it looks like frowning is the shape his face has taken from years of being sullen.\n\nThis picture explains Brett Anderson's comments, however. He is not a happy man, and people that are unhappy generally lash out at any and everyone.\n\nOn the bright side, he's not an A's on-field problem anymore, but A's fans always pay their debts."}

SoMa Play made the game, and they're just a group of people.\n\n\nSure, Ubisoft should've said \"We've had problems with games and lots of friends on the PSN before, so be careful,\" but I'm sure they said a million things that the devs needed to focus on.\n\n\nI just had two of the SoMa Plays guys in my office studying my PS4 and its settings. I feel for them. They finally launch this game and want to celebrate it with the community, and there's this one problem that's related to one of the biggest voices talking about the game. Sucks.\n\n\nAnd, I'm not saying \"No biggie!\" This sucks, but it's a product of where we're at, right? Clearly PlayStation needs to make EVERY debug default to 2,000 friends. Someone needs to be looking for this kinda stuff -- it's just that there are so many variables.\n\n\nI dunno. I feel like we're all so cynical on the Internet. Yeah, they screwed up, but I screw up every day; it's just that my content's free so who cares. I don't feel like we should be flogging them for this one fringe case. If it was broken for EVERYONE or broken on something that's easy to test, I'd get it.\n\n\nKeep in mind that Dead Nation on PS3 had a similar friends list bug at launch; they fixed it; and when it came to PS4, the original bug came, too.\n\n\nNOW FLOG ME FOR NOT WANTING TO FLOG!\n\n\n<3\n\nGreg"}

{"text": "Canada's housing market is in no danger of a correction nationally, but that's not the case in Toronto, Regina and Winnipeg where the CMHC says there's a \"high risk\" of a slowdown.\n\nIn its quarterly house price analysis released Thursday, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation says Toronto, Regina and Winnipeg are at \"high risk\" of a housing correction for a variety of factors.\n\nThe housing agency looks at market conditions in 15 major housing markets across the country. While most markets get a low or moderate risk in the CMHC's eyes, the agency singled out Regina, Winnipeg and Toronto for being in a possible danger zone.\n\nOverbuilding\n\nThe reasons for concern are not the same in each city. In Toronto, the main concern is that \"the rise in house prices has not been matched by growth in personal disposable incomes\" the CMHC said, adding there is evidence of overbuilding in the market, with a historically high level of unsold units.\n\nToronto's conditions have gotten worse since April, when the city was deemed to be at \"moderate risk\" of a slowdown. Regina and Winnipeg, meanwhile, were singled out in the CMHC's last quarterly report in April, too.\n\n\"The high level of risk in Winnipeg reflects risks of overvaluation and overbuilding, while in Regina it reflects price acceleration, overvaluation and overbuilding, particularly of condominium apartments,\" the agency said.\n\nThe rest of the country is deemed to be in pretty good shape from a risk perspective.\n\nMontreal and Quebec City's housing markets were deemed of moderate risk despite the presence of some overvaluation. And the CMHC says Vancouver's housing market is a \"low risk\" one despite sky-high prices, because demand is backed \"by a growing population and growth in personal disposable income.\"\n\nThe last time the CMHC put out its quarterly report, there were only 12 cities in it. This one expanded the scope to 15 and of the three new ones added — Victoria, Hamilton and Moncton — each of which were assessed as \"low overall risk\" in terms of their housing markets."}

Apart from these two, India grabbed three more medals in the team events, including a gold in the men's compound team event.\n\nChauhan had a close encounter in the final against South Korean archer Choi Yong Hee. After being tied at 145:145, the Indian went on to grab the gold by winning the tie-breaker. On the other hand, Vennam edged out Iran's Afsaneh Shafielavijeh 141:137 to grab her first gold in a senior event at the age of 19. Astonishingly, this was not her first medal in the Asian Championship, having won the bronze medal with the Senior women's compound team back in 2011, at the age of 15. In the team events, the women's recurve team, which cruised past China in the semi-final with a score of 5:1, failed to repeat their performance against a strong South Korean unit in the final. Eventually, they had to settle for a silver after losing the final 3:5.\n\nThe women's compound team faced a similar fate against South Korea in the final, although it was a closely fought affair. India won the silver after losing 232:234. The Indian compound men's team, which got the better of a tough Iranian side 237:230 in the semi-final, successfully defended the gold they won in the previous edition as they defeated South Korea in an exhilarating final with a score of 234:233. This was India's fourth gold in the event in the last six editions of the Asian Championship. The day ended on a slightly disappointing note with the India's compound mixed team losing in the third place play-off at the hands of Chinese Taipei 149:152.

The Department of Defense has relied on two inventory systems to track the weapons, leading to duplication of records and other mistakes, it said.\n\nAfghan officials often just don't bother with taking inventory, making it easy for opportunists or Taliban supporters to steal weapons and sell them to insurgents. That's particularly alarming since the U.S. gave Afghanistan's military 83,000 more AK-47 assault rifles than necessary last year.\n\nThe problem of accounting for military hardware delivered to Afghanistan has gone on for some time. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported five years ago that more than one third of the 242,203 small arms and light weapons shipped to the Afghan National Army and the Afghan National Police were not accounted for.

Le Pen has long expressed admiration for Putin, even telling a Russian newspaper in 2011 that \"I admire Vladimir Putin,\" and Le Pen's National Front Party received a $9.7 million loan from a Russian bank in 2014. Le Pen is an advocate for lifting sanctions imposed against Russia after its 2014 invasion of Ukraine and for France pulling out of the European Union, both of which would further Putin's economic and geopolitical goals.\n\nAfter the meeting, Le Pen told reporters that \"it's now the world of Putin, the world of Donald Trump,\" according to The Guardian.\n\nLe Pen raised eyebrows in January when she visited Trump Tower, although she did not visit Trump himself at the time. On the previous day, she was the guest of honor at a cocktail party in Trump Tower at an apartment rented by a right-wing political operative connected to both Trump and European far right politicians.\n\nA recent poll shows that Le Pen and an independent centrist candidate, Emmanuel Macron, are in the lead for the French presidential election, which will be held on April 23, although 43 percent of voters are hesitant about who they should choose. Unless one candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote in that election (which one Goldman Sachs analyst believes is possible, though certainly not a sure thing), a runoff election will be held on May 7.

It says the 3D sensing features will service face recognition and augmented reality applications.\n\nTry Amazon Prime 30-Day Free Trial\n\nFor some time, iPhone 8 rumors suggested that the display would be curved and wrap around the sides of the device. TrendForce says this idea was tabled but ultimately rejected due to poor yield and fragility issues when prototypes were drop-tested. However, the display will still be dramatically new due to the transition from LCD to OLED and the bezel-less design.\n\nTrendForce repeats rumors that the premium iPhone 8 will be more expensive than the current high-end lineup, with a price up to $1000 'or even higher'. Available in 64 GB and 256 GB flavors, it isn't clear if both models would be more than $1000 or just the 256 GB storage tier. It seems likely that Apple will want the 64 GB model to hit the magic $999 price point although this is just speculation.\n\nThe report says Apple is also preparing a new 4.7 inch device and a new 5.5 inch device which are more competitively priced. Nevertheless, TrendForce says that the high-end iPhone 8 will account for at least 40% of units — despite the higher prices. The 'iPhone 7s' devices will have storage tiers up to 256 GB.\n\nThe new iPhone lineup is expected to officially debut in the fall.

That they are not just delivering a message. They're actually showing you humanity. And that's what I tried to do with that character. Whether or not I succeeded or failed depends on your subjective opinion on what you think of people like that. That's my goal as an actor.\"\n\nFearing the actions of a god-like Super Hero left unchecked, Gotham City's own formidable, forceful vigilante takes on Metropolis's most revered, modern-day savior, while the world wrestles with what sort of hero it really needs. And with Batman and Superman at war with one another, a new threat quickly arises, putting mankind in greater danger than it's ever known before. Directed by Zack Snyder, the film also stars Oscar nominees Amy Adams (\"American Hustle,\" \"Man of Steel\") as Lois Lane, Jesse Eisenberg (\"The Social Network\") as Lex Luthor, Diane Lane (\"Unfaithful,\" \"Man of Steel\") as Martha Kent, and Laurence Fishburne (\"What's Love Got to Do with It,\" \"Man of Steel\") as Perry White; Oscar winners Jeremy Irons (\"Reversal of Fortune\") as Alfred, and Holly Hunter (\"The Piano\") as Senator Finch; and Gal Gadot (the \"Fast and Furious\" films) as Wonder Woman/Diana Prince."}

REUTERS/Andy Cross/Pool\n\nHolmes is charged with multiple counts of first-degree murder and attempted murder stemming from a shooting rampage last July that killed 12 moviegoers during a midnight screening of the Batman film \"The Dark Knight Rises\" at a suburban Denver cinema.\n\nFifty-eight other people in the audience were wounded by gunfire and a dozen others suffered other injuries in the ensuing pandemonium.\n\nProsecutors have said they intend to seek the death penalty against Holmes, 25, if he is convicted.\n\nThe California native and former University of Colorado graduate student of neuroscience has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.\n\nHolmes' public defenders have argued that allowing jurors to see their client handcuffed and shackled, as he has been in all of his court appearances so far, would unfairly prejudice them against the accused gunman.\n\nArapahoe County District Judge Carlos Samour Jr. agreed, but said Holmes poses a security risk and that public safety requires that he be restrained during the proceedings.\n\nHolmes will wear a harness under his street clothes with a cable bolting him to the courtroom floor, the judge said.\n\nThe cable will be visible to jurors, Samour said, but should be indistinguishable from computer cords emanating from the defense table.\n\nIn a separate ruling, the judge denied a defense motion requesting that jurors be sequestered during the trial, which is scheduled to start in February 2014 and is expected to last for about four months.\n\nJury sequestration is \"an extremely rare procedure,\" the judge said, noting that it would be expensive and impractical to keep jurors sealed off from the outside world for the duration of the trial.\n\nDefense lawyers can renew the request later if issues arise that warrant another look, Samour said."}

Nunes has stressed that the reports he reviewed, which contained the \"unmasked\" identities of Trump aides whose communications had been swept up in the surveillance of foreigners, are totally unrelated to Russia.\n\nThe White House has been unable to answer questions about who escorted Nunes onto White House grounds and who provided him access to the secure facility where the House Intelligence Committee chairman read the reports.

{"text": "The status of Bitcoin in India has been relatively unsure for quite some time now. Even though the country can benefit a lot from cryptocurrency in their e-commerce and m-commerce sectors, adoption rates were still low. But things are changing in a positive manner as of late. With about 50,000 Bitcoin users in India, things are looking better than ever.\n\nTo put these numbers into perspective, of those 50,000 Bitcoin enthusiasts, close to 30,000 use cryptocurrency for transactions. These figures are provided to us thanks to Coinsecure, which is the leading Bitcoin wallet, exchange, and payment gateway in the country.\n\nBitcoin Usage in India Keeps Increasing\n\nAlthough Bitcoin has been around since 2009, many people still see the cryptocurrency as something that needs to be avoided. Given the fact users are in full control of their funds, they also bear the responsibility if something were to go amiss. Moreover, very few countries acknowledge Bitcoin as a currency, which makes cryptocurrency a \"grey area\", so to speak.\n\nBut that is not keeping enthusiasts in India from embracing Bitcoin, though. While it is doubtful Bitcoin will replace the need for physical currencies anytime soon, it complements the existing financial ecosystem quite well. Retailers see the possibilities by accepting Bitcoin as an alternative payment, on top of more traditional offerings.\n\nDespite the price volatility associated with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, business has been quite good for Coinsecure. As the company offers Bitcoin at the cheapest rates in all of India, they also have a small spread over the market price. This is a solid business strategy, as consumers are less inclined to pay a premium price for something they may never use in real life.\n\nMoreover, retailers in India who sign up through Coinsecure are safe from any Bitcoin price volatility that may occur. Other Bitcoin payment processors are following the same strategy, as they instantly convert cryptocurrency transactions to local currency. Additionally, there are lots of people involved in Bitcoin due to price speculation. Due to its limited coin supply, the chances for profit are very real, albeit people need to keep in mind cryptocurrency is a long-term investment.\n\nSource: Money Control\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock"}

Hours later, a separate judge lifted the restrictions on that grounds that \"it does not seem reasonable that millions of users are affected\" because of the company's wrongdoing.\n\n\"We're pleased that people can access WhatsApp again in Brazil,\" a company spokesman said. \"The Supreme Court swiftly rejected today's block, finding that it was disproportionate and violated people's fundamental freedom of expression.\n\nIn his decision, the chief justice stressed how people from across Brazil, including members of the judiciary, rely on WhatsApp to communicate with others every day, and that they bear the greatest burden when a service is blocked. We hope that this puts an end to blocks that have punished millions of Brazilians and that people can continue using services like WhatsApp to stay in touch with those who matter to them.\""}
{"text": "I had some issues getting MathJax running smoothly alongside Markdown. The main issue stemmed from Markdown not providing a way to temporarily escape from its text transformations, so some L A TEX would get interpreted as Markdown.\n\nThe only way I know of to prevent text transformations in Markdown is through the code block (prefix with 4+ spaces) and inline code (surround with ` ) features. However, both of those wrap the result in some HTML tag ( <pre> for the first, <code> for the second). I decided to use the inline code feature as the basis for inserting my math.\n\nI can insert math by typing, for example \\`\\\\\\( \\\\del \\\\cdot \\\\vec{B} = 0 \\\\\\)\\` . To make this work, I had to use the following MathJax configuration:\n\nMathJax.Hub.Config({ tex2jax: { skipTags: ['script', 'noscript', 'style', 'textarea', 'pre'] } });\n\nThis prevents MathJax from skipping <code> tags. This could potentially cause issues if I used the sequences \\\\\\( , \\\\\\[ , or $$ in a normal (non-math) code block, but I think it's safe to say that those sequences won't show up in most of my code.\n\nThe next step was to make sure MathJax <code> tags weren't actually styled like \"normal\" <code> tags. To do this, I added this to my MathJax configuration:\n\nMathJax.Hub.Queue(function() { // Fix <code> tags after MathJax finishes running. This is a // hack to overcome a shortcoming of Markdown.

And even though the decisions involved appear small, each spot is important during almost every game. Rarely does a manager finish a contest without considering his reserves for pinch-hitting, late-game defense or a double switch for an overextended pitcher. To complicate things, moreover, regulars drop any experimentation and use the last three weeks to prepare for the campaign.\n\nIf you consider their status, the two backups with a shot to go north in April are roster-protected players and invitees. However, Klentak must remove or disable someone from the 40-man roster if an extra participant makes the squad. In other words, those athletes are at a disadvantage from day one.\n\nEntering camp, Andrew Knapp had the inside track for the back half of the catching tandem, but he isn't hitting or ready to play first base. Of course, the plan was for Knapp to back up the regular receiver and starting first baseman, while Jorge Alfaro would handle the games behind the plate for the Triple-A Lehigh Valley IronPigs. However, if this position is still a problem at March's end, Klentak has backstops Ryan Hanigan and Bryan Holaday.\n\nWhile Tom McCarthy's team recently broadcasted a weekend game, two fans watching at home voiced their evaluation regarding the infielders.

Years later, she even performed for powerful leaders of the communist party including Mao Zhe Dong, Zhou EnLai, and Chen Yi.\n\nIn 1964 the film \"Ashima,\" Yang's role was to play an Yi ethnic minority – Ashima. The film was about the life of Yi people in Yunnan's Stone Forest and a pure and innocent love story. Both of these films were regarded as China film industry's masterpieces. The film helped solidify Yang as the Goddess of Beauty in the hearts of Chinese for over half a century. However, the film was also the start of a string of unfortunate events for Yang.\n\nBack then, the very conservative Communist party did not take lightly on a film so openly praising love. Yang was being categorized as an anti-revolutionist and a labelled as \"the poisonous weed of the middle class.\" For years, Yang fought hard and struggled with these anti-patriotic labels. People around her criticized her and left her.

{"text": "On their third album, the War on Drugs essentially continue to stake out their own particular patch of ground in 21st century rock & roll with an indie bent, nodding in equal parts toward older traditions and newer ones with a difference of two decades in between them, captured right down to the cover art, which is pretty much a companion piece to the art on their second album Future Weather. On the one hand, there's still a sense of world-weary wisdom and lost Americana as such at work from the start, as the extended breakdown toward the end of \"Best Night\" demonstrates, all silvery guitar jamming and sparkling piano following from Adam Granduciel's reedy singing. At the same time the diffuse qualities of feedback, psychedelic glaze, and textural experimentation via everything that fed into what became shoegaze (not to mention shoegaze itself) remain key, audible in the opening chimes of \"Brothers\" and \"It's Your Destiny\"'s spaced-out and exultant flow, perhaps most notably on the short instrumentals \"Original Slave\" and \"Come for It.\" If the basic balance remains unchanged, the result has been a sound just enough of the War on Drugs' own as a result, which gets stronger and even more droned out and powerful as the album continues. More than once they find just the right way to make it all click into something even more distinct, like the higher-pitched croon on \"I Was There\" slipping out over a gentle chug underpinned by darker feedback shadings or the Motorik-as-classic-rock-anthem \"Come to the City,\" which practically begs a massive arena/light show performance (little surprise the later instrumental \"City Reprise #12\" takes that feeling and runs with it even more triumphantly). \"Your Love Is Calling My Name\" is the album's clearest barnburner, with a brisk, sharp pace and Granduciel riding-the-freeway-referencing lyrics with an appropriate easygoing elan, all while feeling warm and enveloping around the edges (and especially on the great instrumental break leading back into a wonderful, focused guitar part)."}

{"text": "President Donald Trump still hasn't clarified his own remarks on the record. Thomson Reuters President Donald Trump's initial failure to explicitly condemn white supremacists on Saturday resulted in hours of somewhat muddled messages from the White House, as officials attempted to justify and repeatedly clarify the president's statement.\n\nAfter violence erupted at a white nationalist and neo-Nazi protest in Charlottesville, Virginia, the president issued a brief statement on Saturday in which he decried the \"display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides,\" a reference to the counter-protesters gathered to oppose the white nationalists.\n\nMany critics — including Republicans— slammed Trump for not explicitly calling out the white nationalists in Virginia, noting that one woman was killed when a car drove into a crowd of counter-protesters, and calling it a \"terror attack.\"\n\nTrump's statement sparked a chain of messages sent \"on background\" to reporters in which officials tried to explain the president's vague statement, though none agreed to attach their names to the comments.\n\nAn hour after Trump's press conference, the White House issued a clarifying statement to reporters noting that the president wanted to condemn violence by counter-protesters.\n\nWhite House officials offered similar statements at different points Saturday evening to multiple reporters, including Vanity Fair's Gabe Sherman and Pro Publica's Ken Schwencke.\n\nFor their part, some high-profile figures in the White House issued more forceful denunciations.\n\nNational Security Adviser H.R. McMaster declared the car attack in Charlottesville an act of terrorism, while Ivanka Trump wrote on Twitter that \"there should be no place in society for racism, white supremacy and neo-Nazis.\"\n\nLate Sunday morning, the White House finally clarified that the president broadly condemns the acts of white nationalists. But the communications shop — which initially issued the comment with a spelling error— still chose to keep the statement anonymous.\n\n\"The president said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry, and hatred, and of course that includes white supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazi and all extremist groups,\" an administration figure said in the statement. \"He called for national unity and bringing all Americans together.\""}
{"text": "After all, President Obama is no pushover. In 2013, he decided not to implement his \"red line\" threat to use force if Syria used chemical weapons again, overruling his secretaries of state and defense. On an earlier occasion, he overruled his entire national security team's proposal to arm and train the Syrian opposition. For better or worse, American intervention in Libya was Mr. Obama's decision, not Mrs. Clinton's. It is called the Obama administration for a reason.\n\nSecond, as to why Libya deteriorated so dramatically after Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's fall, Mrs. Clinton worked as hard as anyone to stabilize the country. But in doing so, she was operating pursuant to restrictions imposed by the president, who established strict limits on the United States' military role. The president has come to regret limiting the American contribution to certain air assets and other unique capabilities needed at the outset of the air campaign. In an interview with Thomas L. Friedman, he said the lesson he learned in Libya is \"the need to come in full force if you're going to do this\"and that \"there has to be a much more aggressive effort to rebuild societies.\"\n\nThird, the report's biggest flaw is the scant attention given to the consequences of inaction back in 2011 and the plausible policy alternatives at the time. Knowing Colonel Qaddafi's track record as a sponsor of terrorism and a brutal dictator (psychopath?), Western leaders had good reason to believe the regime's threats of mass murder.\n\nFive years later, in Syria we also have the clearest possible evidence of what happens when a brutal Arab dictator is left unchecked during a democratic uprising. The consequences of inaction there have been immense, with hundreds of thousands of innocent men, women and children killed and refugees overwhelming the region and destabilizing Europe.\n\nThe truth is there were not a lot of options back in 2011. Once the Libyan uprising led to the Qaddafi crackdown, civil war became inevitable. The West did prevent that war from becoming a mass slaughter, which should be a source of satisfaction. The Libyan people certainly don't blame America for the chaos they are living through. So why are the administration's critics doing so?"}

Having picked up so much traction, Grüner's postponed her plans to become a teacher in order to pursue the entrepreneurial life.\n\nShe's's moving forward: Grüner's entered into an agreement with a Danish window manufacturer to produce the greenhouses, which she'll sell directly.\n\n\"Many said to me that it was possible to produce anything in Denmark. But for me it was important that the production take place in this country, explains Grüner. \"It should be a unified narrative, where we develop vegetables locally and then the product is not produced outside the country.\"\n\nBuilt of wood and a durable, UV-coated polycarbonate, the Urban Green House is a mobile oasis in the city, part growing space, part living space. Inside, the greenhouse is outfitted with an eye toward both gardening and socializing. A plant bed area can transform into comfortable seating for two, with a small storage area below to stash garden tools.\n\nAs its tagline \"Homegrown Anywhere\" suggests, the greenhouse's mobility is not only an asset for cramped city spaces, but also enables gardeners to chase the sun or move it out of the way to make room for guests or other activities. And like raised beds, the greenhouse eliminates dealing with the contaminated soil that often renders an urban space unusable for growing food.\n\n\"I could see that this whole urban farming concept was in motion,\" says Grüner. Even those living in the city, believes the 31-year-old entrepreneur, want to know where their food comes from and also have a fundamental need to get in touch with something green.\n\nvia Miss Design Says, Marie-Louise Munter's must-read blog."}
{"text": "The Humane Society of the United States has filed legal complaints with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) alleging that Hillandale Farms, a Costco egg supplier, has deceived consumers with its poor animal welfare standards and \"filthy and unsanitary conditions,\" resulting in food safety concerns. The complaints come weeks after the Humane Society released an undercover video apparently showing egg-laying hens living in filthy conditions, often cramped in cages and standing on top of other hens that had died. The footage also shows what appear to be piles of broken, rotting eggs lying on the floors of the egg-laying facility. The imagery draws a sharp contrast to the depictions of hens roaming freely in a pasture on the Hillandale label, the Humane Society said. \"It's unconscionable to mislead Costco consumers with false depictions of how those eggs were produced,\" said Jonathan Lovvorn, senior vice president and chief counsel for animal protection litigation at the Humane Society, in a written statement. Days after the video became public, Hillandale Farms and Costco released statements disputing the allegations, saying that the undercover employee who shot the footage compromised their animal welfare standards. According to Hillandale, the employee who shot the video was the primary caretaker assigned to the barn and neglected their duties in order to misrepresent the farm's conditions. Costco backed up the farm, saying that it had inspected Hillandale's facilities and confirmed that the egg producer was \"behaving appropriately.\" Hillandale Farms was formerly owned by DeCoster Egg Farms, which was linked to nearly 2,000 Salmonella illnesses in 2010 in a massive outbreak. In April of this year, two company executives, Austin \"Jack\" DeCoster and his son Peter DeCoster, were sentenced to three months in jail for shipping adulterated food. In 2007, Costco pledged to transition to selling only cage-free eggs, but the company has still not set a timetable for when that change would occur. The company says it sells more than 50 million cage-free eggs each year.\n\n(To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)"}

Brand X Internet Services, in which the court upheld that the Federal Communications Commission was correct to rule that bundled broadband Internet was not a traditional utility, and should therefore be treated differently than \"telecommunications services\" like phone companies.\n\nHowever, attached to that ruling is a dissent by beloved conservative firebrand Antonin Scalia, in which the Supreme Court Justice makes a compelling argument that just because broadband services are not offered on a \"stand-alone\" basis, that does not mean they should be treated as different from services that are.\n\n\"It seems to me, that the analytic problem pertains not really to the meaning of 'offer,' but to the identity of what is offered,\" he wrote.\n\n\"It would be odd to say that a car dealer is in the business of selling steel or carpets because the cars he sells include both steel frames and carpeting. Nor does the water company sell hydrogen, nor the pet store water (though dogs and cats are largely water at the molecular level).\"\n\n\"The pet store may have a policy of selling puppies only with leashes,\" Scalia continued, \"but any customer will say that it does offer puppies — because a leashed puppy is still a puppy, even though it is not offered on a 'stand-alone' basis.\""}

The actor told the story of the incident with an unnamed executive in a Twitter message he sent on Oct. 10, in response to the wave of disclosures from women about past experiences with sexual harassment with producer Harvey Weinstein and others.\n\nIt's understood that Crews had been weighing in recent days whether to publicly name Venit as the executive.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nNASA's Kepler spacecraft has discovered its 1,000th alien world, further cementing the prolific planet-hunting mission's status as a space science legend.\n\nKepler reached the milestone on Tuesday with the announcement of eight newly confirmed exoplanets, bringing the mission's current alien world tally to 1,004. Kepler has found more than half of all known exoplanets to date. The telescope has also spotted 3,200 additional planet candidates, and about 90 percent of them should end up being confirmed.\n\nFurthermore, a number of these future finds are likely to be small, rocky worlds with temperate, relatively hospitable surface conditions — in other words, planets a lot like Earth. At least two of the newly confirmed planets appear to meet that description, Kepler team members say.\n\nThose two planets, known as Kepler-438b and Kepler-442b, join six others that were added to Kepler's list in Seattle during the annual winter meeting of the American Astronomical Society. Kepler-438b orbits a relatively cool star that's 475 light-years away and is 12 percent bigger than Earth. Kepler-442b is 33 percent bigger than Earth, and is 1,100 light-years from us. [Gallery: A World of Kepler Planets]\n\nEight of the newly identified candidate planets appear to be between one and two times the size of Earth, and orbit in their stars' habitable zone — the area where water could exist in liquid form. Six of those candidates have parent stars that are similar to our own sun in size and temperature. However, all of the candidates require follow-up observations and analysis to verify they are actual planets.\n\n\"Kepler was designed to find these Earth analogues, and we always knew that the most interesting results would come at the end,\" Kepler mission scientist Natalie Batalha of NASA's Ames Research Center told Space.com last month. \"So we're just kind of ramping up toward those most interesting results.\"\n\nThe latest findings have been submitted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal and The Astrophysical Journal Supplement."}

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nThe trustee, Irving Picard, had sought the approval of the distribution last month from U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland in Manhattan. The trustee has already distributed $1.1 billion to former customers of the convicted Ponzi schemer.\n\nApproval of the second distribution had previously been expected. Objectors have 14 days to appeal the latest decision.\n\nA large chunk of the recoveries have been put in reserve because of litigation with victims who contend they are owed more.\n\nPicard had measured losses as the difference between the amounts that customers deposited and the amounts they withdrew from the Madoff firm before the fraud was uncovered in December 2008. Some customers wanted recoveries based on their final account statements, even if the amounts shown were made up.\n\nPicard has estimated that Madoff victims lost about $20 billion from the fraud.\n\nBernard Madoff, 74, pleaded guilty in March 2009 and is serving a 150-year sentence in a North Carolina federal prison.\n\nThe new distribution by the trustee is likely to boost the mini-market of trading in the rights to any potential recoveries. Bankruptcy claims trading in the Madoff case has moved in fits and starts, according to traders.\n\nIt's unclear how many Madoff investors have sold their claims, or at what prices. There is no legal requirement for claims trades to be made public because Madoff's firm was unwound under the auspices of the Securities Investor Protection Corp that helps clients of failed brokerages, instead of through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nThe case is Securities Investor Protection Corp v Bernard L.

{"text": "Israel's defense minister said Tuesday that the country had interpreted Iran's conversion of some enriched uranium to fuel rods for civilian use as evidence that Iran had delayed ambitions to build a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe assertion, by Defense Minister Ehud Barak in an interview with The Daily Telegraph, a British newspaper, amounted to the first explanation from him as to why he and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu softened their position in September over the possibility of a military strike to thwart what they called Iran's drive toward imminent nuclear weapons capability.\n\nTheir tough position on Iran, which they consider Israel's most dangerous enemy, had generated tensions with the Obama administration, which has contended that Iran is many months away from the ability to make a nuclear weapon.\n\nMr. Barak, who was visiting London, was quoted by the newspaper as saying an immediate crisis had been averted this summer because Iran had chosen to use a third of its enriched uranium for use as fuel rods in a medical research reactor. The conversion of that uranium, which was reported by the International Atomic Energy Agency in August, makes it much more difficult to use militarily.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Iranian decision, Mr. Barak said, \"allows contemplating delaying the moment of truth by 8 to 10 months.\"\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

{"text": "JERUSALEM — A famously child-friendly country with a federally subsidized universal health care system that offers free fertility treatments, Israel has made it easier for economically distressed women to obtain an abortion.\n\nThe 2014 \"health basket\" of medical services and medications approved by Israel's cabinet Sunday (Jan. 5) includes free abortions for Israeli women aged 20 to 33, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nThe $4.6 million earmarked by the Health Ministry committee will cover some 6,300 abortions for women who cannot afford the procedure.\n\nIn 2013, almost 20,000 women received permission to abort from hospital termination committees, according to Efrat, an organization that encourages women considering abortion to have their babies.\n\nUntil now, government-funded abortions have been reserved for women younger than 19 or older than 40, and in cases where the fetus has a severe defect, the mother's life is endangered, or the pregnancy is a result of sexual abuse. If a woman believed the pregnancy would cause her harm, physically or emotionally, she had had to pay for the procedure herself.\n\nRuth Tidhar, who heads Efrat's assistance department, said that in a country like Israel, where mothers receive paid maternity leave and preschool education is heavily subsidized, \"it gives a mixed message when contraceptives aren't funded by the government while abortions are.\"\n\nJudaism does not share the Roman Catholic belief that life begins at conception, but various Jewish streams have a range of opinions on the issue. The one thing most Jews agree on: That abortion is always permissible if the mother's life is in danger.\n\nRabbi David Stav, the head of Tzohar, a modern-Orthodox rabbinical organization, criticized the new abortion guidelines.\n\nIn a TV interview on Arutz Sheva, Stav said it is \"immoral\" for the state to fund abortions that result from a mother's \"personal decisions\" rather than serious medical problems.\n\n\"The state (will be) allocating resources for personal decisions,\" said Stav that are \"forbidden by Jewish law.\"\n\nCopyright: For copyright information, please check with the distributor of this item, Religion News Service LLC."}

But State Department spokesman Elizabeth Trudeau said the FBI asked the department to stop so as not to interfere with the FBI's own investigation.\n\nShe said State asked the FBI for a ruling in February on whether it should proceed, and that the FBI told State to stand down on its review sometime in March.\n\n\"We contacted the FBI to solicit a judgement from them as to the best path forward,\" Trudeau told reporters when asked about the review of the 22 emails that included \"top secret\" information. She didn't clarify if the decision affected hundreds of other emails that included classified information.\n\n\"The FBI communicated to us that we should follow our standard practice, which is to put our internal review on hold while there is an ongoing law enforcement investigation underway,\" she said.\n\n\"Of course, we do not want our internal review to complicate or impede the process of their ongoing law enforcement investigation,\" she added. \"Therefore, the State Department at this time is not moving forward with our internal review.\"\n\nTrudeau had no comment on whether the move might be a sign that the FBI is preparing criminal charges against Clinton or any of her aides.\n\n\"I wouldn't read anything into it,\" she said.\n\nShe also said the internal review would continue once the FBI's investigation is completed.\n\nThe issue of when the information was deemed \"top secret\" or classified at the time is important, because it appeared in emails that were sent or received by Clinton on her private email system. The risk of sensitive information being disseminated likely increased once it appeared on Clinton's unsecure, private server.\n\nTrudeau was pressed several times why State's internal review would have to stop, or how it might complicate the FBI's investigation, but offered little else.\n\n\"We don't want to complicate the law enforcement investigation, that takes priority,\" she said."}
{"text": "Jimmy Clausen going 23-of-39 for 181 yards, two touchdowns and one interception in a Week 16 start versus the Detroit Lions did not convince ESPN NFL Insider Matt Williamson that Chicago is sufficiently protected at backup quarterback in the event Jay Cutler suffers an injury.\n\nWilliamson includes the Bears on a list of five teams that should consider trading for Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Mike Glennon, who is now expendable after the Bucs invested the No. 1 overall pick in Jameis Winston.\n\nThe feeling in Tampa is that head coach Lovie Smith eventually names Winston his Week 1 starting quarterback, despite Glennon passing for 4,025 yards, 29 touchdowns and 15 interceptions in 2013-14.\n\nWilliamson writes: \"The Bears would love to be rid of Jay Cutler, but his contract won't allow that. A strong-armed quarterback is a must in the Windy City, and that's one of Glennon's biggest strengths. He'd be an immediate upgrade over Jimmy Clausen, the current No. 2, and could potentially take over for Cutler late this season if Cutler repeats his dreadful 2014 campaign. It's not far-fetched to think that if Glennon ends up in Chicago, he would enter 2016 as a clear starter.\"\n\nInterestingly, Bears offensive coordinator Adam Gase called Clausen a \"perfect fit\" at the No. 2 spot, even though the Notre Dame product has only appeared in 17 games (11 starts) and thrown for 1,781 yards, five touchdowns and 10 interceptions (60.2 quarterback rating) since he entered the league in 2010.\n\n\"I feel like from what we saw on tape last year -- and I know it was limited, I know what we saw on tape was limited -- but he's really grown as a player,\" Gase said in May. \"And what we're trying to put together right now, he was a great fit for that room. He and Jay have a great relationship. I felt like he'd be perfect for what we were trying to do offensively.\"\n\nHistory tells us the Bears better have a capable backup quarterback on the roster. Cutler has missed 14 games over the past five seasons, meaning Gase's theory on Clausen is likely to be tested."}

I was disturbed because I knew that his comments would be used against pro-life and traditional marriage activists. I knew that sidewalk counselors would be told by those supporting abortion that the pope told them not to be \"obsessed\" with abortion. Traditional marriage supporters would also be told that the pope said, \"Who are you to judge?\"\n\nI'll be honest, I was disturbed. While it's clear that the pope is not changing Church teaching he is clearly changing the emphasis. The pope with a few words has unsettled so much. With a few words the pope has unsettled me.\n\nBut I thought and prayed about it yesterday and finally came to the realization that maybe that's not such a terrible thing. The Catholic faith was never meant to be a settled one. We are called to light the world on fire with love. And I wondered if this was a moment to afford me the opportunity to consider my faith differently. To deepen it. I know that I can be guilty of being a bit abrasive and mocking towards those who disagree with the Church's teaching on life and marriage.\n\nSmarter people than me can tell you what the pope was saying but what I took from it was that the pope was telling us that there is so much more to the faith than the anti-abortion movement and the defense of marriage. He wasn't discounting them, but he was inviting us to a deeper understanding of the faith. Our faith is not an either/or. We are called to live in the fullness of the gospel.\n\nWe are called to love everyone. Everyone. And I think that's something I need to work on. It's not enough to be right. We're called to love. It's much harder.\n\nI think the pope was reminding us that we are a religion of \"yes.\" It's like when you get married your \"I do\" is also an \"I never will\" to millions of women on the planet.

Sources connected to the strip club tell us Martin was hanging out with roughly 15 to 30 teammates that night and appeared to be enjoying himself (just look at the grin and the stack of cash in his hand).We're also told ... the text messages show Martin would OFTEN reach out to Incognito about his fondness for strip clubs, especially Tootsie's ... and never gave any hint that he was ever uncomfortable in that scene.In one of the texts, sent in June 2013, Martin told Incognito he liked Tootsie's so much, he planned to bring some visiting high school friends to the joint for a good time.There's more ... we're also told the text exchanges show a conversation in which Martin said he couldn't make it out one night because \"Mary Jane\" had him glued to his couch.We also know investigators have obtained hundreds of texts between Richie and Martin, which show they often exchanged graphic taunts ... and that Martin gave as good as he got. Incognito has previously explained that he considered Martin one of his best friends and that the texts were in good fun.We reached out to Martin's camp for comment -- and a rep told us, \"We are fully participating in the independent investigation and await the results.\""}
{"text": "Google is apparently planning to offers subsidized, commercial-grade Wi-Fi hardware to small and medium-sized businesses, The Information reports, alongside software to help greatly improve the quality of the Wi-Fi experience at places like doctors' offices, restaurants, gyms and more. The hardware would be the only cost involved, as it would use the businesses' existing Internet connections, unlike the Google-provided Wi-Fi networks running at Starbucks businesses across the U.S.\n\nThe plan is to get better Wi-Fi in the hands of these businesses in order to get more users working on Google apps and services, which ultimately means more customers spending more time engaging with Google's money-making products, even when they're away from their usual home and work Wi-Fi networks. This is the same team behind Google Fiber, the search giant's high-speed net and TV service, which is being trialled in select markets across the U.S., The Information reports.\n\nA key feature of said network would be that it could remember a user based on their Google account login, and set them up on any other Google-controlled Wi-Fi network anywhere in the world automatically. This so-called Hotspot 2.0 feature would help in terms of clearing up the onerous task of signing in to new networks every single time. And for Google, it means getting users more friction-free access to their Google accounts and services, which has obvious benefits in terms of its ad recommendation engines and products.\n\nGoogle ultimately wants to blanket the world in connectivity, because that's the best way for it to grow its user base and get its products in front of as many people as possible. The company announced its acquisition of Titan Aerospace last month, which helps with its ambitious Project Loon – bringing Internet connections to remote corners of the globe. This SMB Wi-Fi project isn't quite as fantastic in scale, but if real, it has the same aim: make it so as many people as possible can use Google products as much as possible, as often as possible, as easily as possible.\n\nWe've reached out to Google for confirmation or more info, and will update if we hear back. Update: Google had no comment on this report."}
{"text": "Move over, Janet Jackson: America is officially more concerned with the future of the internet than with your nipple.\n\nAfter a day of protest against Federal Communications Commission (FCC) proposals for regulating the internet that was coordinated by some of the world's largest tech companies, the agency announced on Wednesday it had received a record 1,477,301 public comments about the proposals since July.\n\nThe previous record of 1.4 million was set in 2004 when an alleged \"wardrobe malfunction\" during the halftime show at the Super Bowl led to Jackson's breast (plus nipple shield) being flashed to an audience of 111 million.\n\nThe record was broken as tech companies including Twitter, Reddit, Google and others called on their users to contact the FCC and Congress and express their disapproval over new rules now being considered that they claim would impact \"net neutrality\".\n\nNet neutrality is the concept that all traffic on the internet is treated equally and that no internet service provider can offer a higher speed service that could unfairly advantage one content provider over another.\n\nThe number of submissions is likely to rise even higher before a Monday deadline for public comments on the FCC proposals, which are a result of chairman Tom Wheeler's being forced to rewrite the rules on net neutrality after a federal court tossed the agency's previous set.\n\nOne of the proposals has sparked controversy because it would allow internet service providers like Verizon, AT&T and Comcast to create a so-called \"fast lane\" for certain traffic – a move critics say would de facto create slow lanes.\n\nComments to the FCC spiked earlier this year when comedian John Oliver, on his HBO show, called on people to bombard the FCC in support of net neutrality. \"The only two words in the English language more boring than net neutrality are 'featuring Sting,'\"­ said Oliver. \"But here's the thing. Net neutrality is actually hugely important.\"\n\nThe FCC's antiquated and under funded systems crashed under the volume of calls and submissions shortly after Oliver's remarks.\n\nThe FCC fined CBS a record $500,000 over the Jackson incident, though that fine was eventually overturned on appeal. Several big media conglomerates imposed a blacklist on Jackson's music and videos in the immediate wake of the scandal."}

A study by the Pew Research Center finds that teenagers are more likely to interact with their friends via text messaging than have face-to-face conversations with them.\n\nA national survey of teens ages 13 to 17 found that 55% text their friends every day. But just 25% of teens spend time with friends in person (outside of school) on a daily basis. In-person interaction was third behind instant messaging (27% use daily).\n\nAnd 75% of teens text message their friends at least every few days. By comparison, 64% of teens spend time with their friends in person outside of school at least every few days, Pew said in its report out Thursday.\n\nOther popular forms of teen communication include social media sites, video chatting and networked video games.\n\nWhen teens make new friends, the first contact information they're likely to share is a phone number for texting. The top forms of contact information shared first are phone number for texting (54%), social media username (18%), phone number for calling (9%), email address (6%) and gaming handle (5%), Pew said.\n\nTeens today even make new friends digitally.\n\nSome 57% of teens have met a new friend online. Social media (such as Facebook (FB) and Instagram) and online gameplay are the most common digital venues for meeting friends, Pew said.\n\nFor its study, Pew interviewed more than 1,000 teens ages 13 to 17 who have at least one close friend.\n\nIn total, 92% of respondents use the Internet daily.\n\nAsked about devices, 87% own a desktop or laptop computer, 81% own a game console, 73% own a smartphone, and 58% own a tablet.\n\nAmong social media sites, Facebook is tops with 71% of teens using it, followed by Facebook-owned Instagram (52%), Snapchat (41%), and Twitter (TWTR) and Google (GOOGL)-owned Google+ (each with 33%).\n\nSo, the next time you see a teenager glued to their smartphone, tell yourself they're not being antisocial, they're being social .. . digitally."}

{"text": "John Mearsheimer is having a great moment. Adam Kirsch at Tablet has followed up on Robert Kaplan's glowing profile of Mearsheimer in the Atlantic as a trailblazing thinker with a piece on The Israel Lobby as \"an intellectual landmark.\" It includes the statement that to judge from its reviews the book convinced no one of its argument. As if the reviews did not originate largely from the lobby itself, or its penumbra, from people like Leslie Gelb who supported the Iraq war, he confessed, so as not to damage his career. Or from Jeffrey Goldberg who of course served in the Israeli army and then promoted the Iraq war because of evidence he had seen that Saddam was acquiring weapons of mass destruction.\n\nAn intellectual landmark– and the New York Review of Books has never reviewed it. Some ideas are too unsettling even to be poked at. I think Kirsch rightly describes the book as broaching the subject of Jewish influence. This is a great subject, as Jewish influence has produced magnificent things in the west… for instance the emigration of my grandfathers and so many others of their generation from eastern Europe under the pressure of bankers at the turn of the century… for instance the New York Review of Books' opposition to the Vietnam War. And yet it is a subject too unsettling to Jews of NYRB editor Robert Silvers's generation, who see it only through the prism of anti-Semitism, the vocalization of an American society they don't fully trust.\n\nAs Kafka wrote to his friend, the Zionist Max Brod in 1922:\n\n\"The dubious aspect of [a recently-published piece of Brod's] seems to me to be a distinctly Jewish complex of problems, springing from the confusion that the natives are too alien to one, thus distorting reality, and the Jews too close, distorting reality, and therefore one cannot treat the latter or the former with the proper balance.\"\n\nAt a time of incredible Jewish presence in the establishment, and widespread Jewish intermarriage, it is time to resolve this complex. When Robert Kaplan writes in his piece that the Walt and Mearsheimer piece on the Israel lobby was rejected by the Atlantic in 2005 because editors fiercely questioned its \"objectivity,\" that is an expression of the complex."}
{"text": "Ye Olde Server Pack (YOSP) is a fairly lightweight pack intended to recapture the feeling of old packs from the earliest versions of modded Minecraft, specifically those on Minecraft 1.2.5. It made made for use on a private server, hence the name, but will work perfectly fine in singleplayer or for use on your own server. In updating to a modern version, we included some newer mods that fit the theme of the original packs, along with many of the quality-of-life mods now available. (Not to mention some much nicer terrain generation, courtesy of Biomes O' Plenty and Alternate Terrain Generation!)\n\nYOSP includes several tech and magic mods, allowing for multiple styles of play. The main tech mods available are Buildcraft, IC2, Mekanism, and Immersive Engineering. IC2 Experimental's recipes have been extensively changed to be more similar to IC2 Classic and to generally reduce microcrafting. Mekanism has been heavily nerfed (especially power generation options) to keep it balanced with IC2. Applied Energistics is excluded in favor of Logistics Pipes, as a complicated pipe network stretching throughout your factory is iconic to older packs, and very much something we want to encourage.\n\nOn the magic side, options include Thaumcraft (with addons Thaumic Tinkerer, Forbidden Magic, and Automagy), Botania, and Witchery. Most magic mods tend to integrate well with the vanilla experience and support, rather than overpower, other options, so including several felt like a natural fit for the pack. ProjectE is also included, since it's predecessor Equivalent Exchange 2 was a core inclusion in many old packs. However, the recipes for the Energy Condenser and Transmutation Tablet have been made significantly more expensive in an effort to balance the mod.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nFor SSP, use World Type 'ATG - Alternate' for proper terrain.\n\nFor servers, use World Type 'ATG'.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nv1.4 Server Files (the files aren't being processed by CurseForge, so this is an alternate link)\n\nSphax PureBDcraft mod textures (doesn't include vanilla textures)"}
{"text": "The list of the world's biggest banks is out and China is on top.\n\nThe biggest bank in the world today is Industrial and Commercial Bank of China with $3.062 trillion in assets, according to SNL Financial. The second spot goes to UK's HSBC with $2.723 trillion in assets followed by France's Crédit Agricole at number three overseeing $2.615 trillion.\n\nNotice any bank missing from the top of the list? That's right. Not one U.S. bank made the top 5 of the list. In fact, the U.S.'s biggest bank is only the world's sixth largest. That bank is JPMorgan Chase with $2.463 trillion in assets as of September 2013.\n\nThe next U.S. bank on the list doesn't pop up on the list until the 12th spot; Bank of America's $2.126 trillion doesn't even put it in the top 10.\n\nOverall, China has the largest number of big banks, with 14 of the top 100 headquartered in the country. Next is the United States, which has 10 of the top 100, according to SNL's rankings.\n\nSo what gives? The U.S. is home to some of the biggest, most powerful banks in the world yet French and Chinese make up most of the top 10.\n\nThe answer is in the accounting of assets. Most of the world including the European Union and China use a system dubbed International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS. The U.S. meanwhile uses Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP.\n\nUnder IFRS banks report the gross amount of derivative assets on their balance sheets, while U.S. GAAP standards say banks must report the net amount of derivative assets.\n\nThe difference is significant when it comes to tallying bank assets. In fact, if US banks were to use the IFRS system JPM and BofA would take the number one and two spots respectively. Citigroup, now 14th with $1.899 trillion, would be the world's 5th largest bank.\n\nBelow is the adjusted ranking for U.S. banks if they reported under IFRS (see the original list here):"}

{"text": "The Federal Emergency Management Agency can't adequately account for more than 70 percent of the money spent on fuel for New York in the aftermath of superstorm Sandy, a federal audit released on Friday found.\n\nFEMA spent $6.37 million for 1.7 million gallons of fuel as a gasoline shortage crippled the New York City area after the October 2012 storm, according to the audit from the Office of Inspector General at the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nBut the audit found \"incomplete and questionable\" documentation for $4.56 million of that spending. Additionally, $1.81 million worth of fuel went to recipients outside the scope of work that FEMA established for the crisis, the audit found. As a result, FEMA can't be sure any of that fuel went to approved power restoration or emergency public transportation work in New York, the audit said.\n\nOfficials at FEMA agreed with all of the report's recommendations, which include recovering lost funds and devising new procedures, according to the audit.\n\nA spokeswoman for FEMA said: \"FEMA concurred with all of the OIG recommendations for rectifying the issues identified in their recent report and improving mission assignment effectiveness going forward. FEMA takes seriously its duty to ensure fiscal responsibility during disaster relief operations, and has been reimbursed by New York for more than $2.1 million.\"\n\nNew York state collected the $1.8 million, plus interest, from the retail gas stations that were the wrongful recipients of the fuel and reimbursed FEMA, the Dept. of Homeland Security said. Sandy, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms on record, knocked out power to gas stations, caused widespread flooding and cut gasoline-supply lines from ports.\n\nGasoline shortages emerged as one of the biggest problems for the region after the storm passed. At the time, the federal government estimated that only one-third of gas stations in the metropolitan area had fuel for sale, based on a survey that found more than half were shut down.\n\nFEMA stepped up to provide fuel for urgent power restoration and transportation needs.\n\nThe unaccounted fuel deliveries occurred because FEMA didn't comply with federal regulations requiring the agency provide proper documentation accounting for its work, the audit found.\n\nClick for more from The Wall Street Journal"}

Design: Jasiek Krzysztofiak/Nature\n\nThe Ebola outbreak in West Africa continues to rage, with the number of people infected roughly doubling every 3–4 weeks. More than 8,000 people are thought to have contracted the disease, and almost half of those have died, according to the World Health Organization. Although these estimates are already staggering, the situation on the ground means that not all cases and deaths are being reported, so the true extent is likely to be much greater.\n\nOutside of Africa, a health-care worker in Texas has become infected while treating a patient who was hospitalized in Dallas after travelling from Liberia and who has now died. And a nurse in Madrid has contracted the virus after caring for a missionary who had become infected while caring for patients in West Africa. Health-care workers remain one of the groups at highest risk of exposure: by 8 October, 416 had become infected and 233 had died.\n\nThe spread beyond the epicentre of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone remains limited. Apart from the people in Dallas and Spain, only two other exported cases are known: one in Nigeria and one in Senegal. A man who travelled to Lagos from Liberia sparked a further 19 cases in Nigeria, but that outbreak was curtailed by the swift actions of the authorities in tracing and monitoring those who had contact with the infected man. Similar public-health measures stopped further cases in Senegal after an infected man travelled from Guinea to Dakar.\n\nWithin the epicentre, authorities have made some progress in slowing transmission — but the disease is resurgent in places where it had seemed under control, such as in Conakry, Guinea's capital.\n\nMeanwhile, the estimated cost of fighting the disease is spiralling upward. UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon warned on 9 October that \"at least a 20-fold surge in assistance\" was needed to confront the outbreak. But \"things will get worse before they get better\", he warned. Just how much worse will depend on the international community — which has been widely criticized for its belated response, and its slow translation of pledges into concrete action."}

Closed storefronts have been painted to resemble working stores, complete with doors that appear open but don't function and two-dimensional goods hanging from the windows, all in an effort to hide the dereliction caused by the economic struggles of the past few years, according to the Irish Times.\n\n\"We want to present the county as best as we can and promote it in terms of industry and tourism,\" local Council Chief Executive Brendan Hegarty told The Irish Times, calling the project a \"phenomenal opportunity.\"\n\nBut some locals view the superficial efforts as a wasteful attempt to hide real economic struggles. This particular area in Northern Ireland suffers higher child poverty rates than the rest of the country, ThinkProgress reports. Meanwhile, lost jobs and failed businesses in the fallout from the global financial crisis are recovering at a glacial pace -- economic growth in Northern Ireland is expected to remain under 0.5 percent through 2014, Belfast Telegraph reports.\n\n\"No one is fooled,\" Phil Flanagan, a former owner of a closed butcher shop which has now been papered over to appear as if it's still thriving, told The Telegrpah. \"It is like when your mother-in-law is coming to visit and you give the house a tidy up.\"\n\nIndeed, such attempts to hide harsh economic realities aren't new. In 2010, the U.K. town of North Tyneside painted nearly an entire street with decoy storefronts to hide the effects of recession, the BBC reports.\n\nBut not everyone in County Fermanagh views the fake shops negatively. The project has provided a much needed stimulus in the form of jobs for painters and construction workers, according to the BBC.\n\n\"The town looks fantastic, it's a good excuse for people to get doing work,\" one painter said."}

{"text": "In 1914 while he was still studying at Oxford, J.R.R. Tolkien began work on a manuscript that would eventually inspire Middle Earth and his 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. Although this story was never finished, the 100-year-old manuscript titled 'The Story of Kullervo' will soon be published and available in the United States this fall.\n\nTolkien created The Story of Kullervo' after his interest in the 19th-century Finnish epic poem, \"The Kalevala\". A compilation of folklore and mythology, \"The Kalevala\" is considered one of the most important works of Finnish literature. It includes creation myths, numerous protagonists and the presence of a magical talisman known as the Sampo.\n\nTolkein stated, \"The germ of my attempt to write legends on my own to fit my private languages was the tragic tale of the hapless Kullervo in the Finnish Kalevala. It remains a major matter in the legends of the First Age (which I hope to publish as The Silmarillion.)\"\n\nHere's the official synopsis for 'The Story of Kullervo':\n\nKullervo son of Kalervo is perhaps the darkest and most tragic of all J.R.R. Tolkien's characters. 'Hapless Kullervo', as Tolkien called him, is a luckless orphan boy with supernatural powers and a tragic destiny. Brought up in the homestead of the dark magician Untamo, who killed his father, kidnapped his mother, and who tries three times to kill him when still a boy, Kullervo is alone save for the love of his twin sister, Wanona, and guarded by the magical powers of the black dog, Musti. When Kullervo is sold into slavery he swears revenge on the magician, but he will learn that even at the point of vengeance there is no escape from the cruelest of fates.\n\n'The Story of Kullervo' was published once before in 2010, but this is the first time it will be made available for the general public. Though the story is unfinished, the publication will include some of Tolkien's margin notes.\n\nSources: The Verge"}

Both wives looked stricken, and Ryan himself seemed grim. They all were thrust on that stage without understanding what had just happened. \"He was shellshocked,\" one adviser said of Romney.\n\n[T]hey believed the public/media polls were skewed - they thought those polls oversampled Democrats and didn't reflect Republican enthusiasm. They based their own internal polls on turnout levels more favorable to Romney.\n\nThe huge and enthusiastic crowds in swing state after swing state in recent weeks - not only for Romney but also for Paul Ryan - bolstered what they believed intellectually: that Obama would not get the kind of turnout he had in 2008.\n\nThe GOP's reality-distortion field went all the way to the top Thus, it was crushing when reality intruded their fantasy world.Why were they so certain of victory?

This 384kHz converter, phono preamp, and headphone amplifier with an integrated atomic clock and gold-plated relay volume control utilizes the 10M Rubidium atomic clock, which is said to be 100,000 times more stable than a traditional crystal oscillator. Coupled with Antelope's 64-bit \"Acoustically Focused Clocking technology\" the Rubidium purportedly manages jitter superbly. Already boasting an award from Japan, the unit is one of several from the company that uses DACs endorsed by Morten Lindberg, founder and chief engineer of audiophile label 2L.\n\nThe Rubicon has the same 384k DAC and 64-bit clocking and jitter management technologies as in the much less expensive Zodiac Gold \"HD Audiophile 384kHz DAC\" ($3895) plus the Voltikus power supply ($995). This much smaller, less imposing unit also boasts a preamp, headphone amp, and remote control. (The Zodiac 192kHz DAC, and Zodiac+ Mastering DAC, one of which is shown to the right of the Rubicon, are available at even lower prices, and reportedly sound excellent). The Rubicon, however, is claimed to deliver superior sound because DAC, preamp, and everything else listed above are housed together, obviating the need for lots of extra cables.\n\nMost impressive was Marcel James' demo where a 192kHz digital transfer of an analog original sounded remarkably close to the vinyl itself; so close that I could not distinguish the difference in fast back and forths. That is, as far as I could tell. Hooked up to pro gear and speakers that I was unfamiliar with, the system was played quite loudly, with an aggressive sound that I could not warm to. The Zodiacs and Rubicon are definitely units that I hope to evaluate in my reference system, with material I'm familiar with."}

{"text": "FORT HOOD, Texas — Defense attorneys ordered to help the Army psychiatrist charged in the deadly 2009 Fort Hood shooting rampage said Tuesday that it would be unethical to give him their legal advice and opinions while he's representing himself at his upcoming murder trial.\n\nAfter allowing Maj. Nidal Hasan to serve as his own attorney, Army judge Col. Tara Osborn last week said his former attorneys would stand by and help him if he requests it.\n\nOn Tuesday, former lead defense attorney Lt. Col. Kris Poppe said complying with the judge's order would be unethical because it seems to have no limits and requires the attorneys to give legal opinions in addition to doing research.\n\nHasan told the judge Tuesday that a paralegal did research about his defense strategy over the weekend, instead of the three attorneys. He said the attorneys refused to give their opinions when he asked what evidence and witnesses would best help his case.\n\n\"They don't believe that I should go forward with (this defense) ... and by helping me, they believe that crosses an ethical line,\" Hasan told the judge during the one-hour hearing.\n\nOsborn had asked Hasan for more information, including a legal basis and any evidence to support his \"defense of others\" strategy, which would require him to prove that the shootings were necessary to prevent the immediate harm or death of others. Hasan has said he shot U.S. troops on the Texas Army post to protect Taliban leaders in Afghanistan.\n\nHasan, an American-born Muslim, faces the death penalty or life without parole if convicted in the rampage that left 13 dead and nearly three dozen wounded.\n\nIt's unclear when the judge will rule on whether to allow Hasan's defense strategy or on his request for a three-month trial delay. Jury selection was to begin last week, with testimony starting in early July. But that has been delayed since various issues have arisen after Hasan requested and was allowed to be his own attorney.\n\nOn Tuesday, Osborn refused Poppe's request for a closed hearing, but she gave defense attorneys about 24 hours to submit motions supporting their argument that they cannot comply with the judge's orders to help Hasan. Osborn said it's within a standby attorney's scope to give opinions to a defendant representing himself."}

It's time to celebrate your career — and this time, no one can stop you.\n\nMetal Gear creator and renowned industry auteur Hideo Kojima was supposed to win a lifetime-achievement prize at The Game Awards in 2015, but publisher Konami — his former employer — blocked him from accepting it (Metal Gear Solid V voice actor Kiefer Sutherland took to the stage on his behalf). But now Kojima is no longer at Konami, and the award show, run by longtime industry hype man and journalist Geoff Keighley, is going to finally give Kojima his moment to shine under the light of 2017 game trailers emanating from the stage. The Game Awards air December 1 on YouTube Gaming, and you should expect to see teasers for upcoming games while nominees like Doom, Overwatch, and Titanfall 2 battle over trophies.\n\nFor Kojima, however, this is a chance to step out from the grim shadow that Konami cast over what was otherwise an impressive year for the creator. In 2015, the director released Metal Gear Solid V to glowing reviews. But Konami, which has shifted resources away from traditional game development in favor of mobile and gambling operations, ended its employment contract with Kojima only a few short months after MGSV debuted.\n\nI've reached out to Konami to ask if it has a comment on its former star developer finally getting to accept his award, but the company has not responded to whether or not it regrets its words and deeds.\n\nHe finally gets his trophy! @HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN to receive Industry Icon Award live at @thegameawards 2016 on Dec 1. https://t.co/JhGKOCSGza pic.twitter.com/RHXNbyp9Py — Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) November 17, 2016\n\nKojima likely won't only accept an award.

It's possible that Kojima will take this opportunity to show off more about the mysterious game, which is supposed to hit PlayStation 4 before the heat death of the universe."}

An in-house wireless network would reduce such capacity issues when call volume is high.\n\nThe antenna technology is fairly common in stadiums, hotels and more recently, office towers, said Laura Keyes, a senior account executive at Axispoint Technology Solutions Group, which designs and installs distributed antenna systems. \"Residential buildings were later to the game,\" she said, \"but now almost all new construction includes a specification for D.A.S.\"\n\nOver the last year, the firm has designed 14 distributed antenna systems for new residential and commercial towers, double the number of the previous year.

(J. Lorenzo et al./University of Alicante)\n\nBut given their immense size, they have to be in extremely close orbits to make a full turn so quickly. This means the stars are actually touching each other and that the material on their outer layers are forming a common envelope. Physicists call it a 'contact binary.' Both components are churning away on the main sequence, and are probably not far from the initial zero-age main sequence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, the astronomers say that MY Cam is a young system that formed about two million years ago. Its current configuration may very well be the one it was born into, but it wasn't meant to last. According to the researchers, the system will eventually merge and create one massive single object. But some theoretical models are predicting an extremely fast merger process culminating in a massive release of energy in the form of an explosion.\n\nThat said, many astrophysicists believe that the merger of close binaries are the most efficient way to generate extremely massive stars.

Tennant says he respects the source material. (Marvel MAX)\n\nThe Peabodys also recognized two other Netflix shows: the Aziz Ansari comedy \"Master of None\" and the African civil-war drama \"Beasts of No Nation.\"\n\nThe win by \"Jessica Jones\" is especially notable, though, because it is uncommon Peabody recognition of comics-adapted material — the win necessarily reflects on the inspired source material. The series is part of Netflix and Marvel's five-show collaboration that kicked off with \"Daredevil.\"\n\n\"Jessica Jones\" has shown an audience appeal beyond some \"superhero shows\" — in part, of course, because the title character, uncannily portrayed by Krysten Ritter, is a failed superhero turned superpowered noir detective.

Artur was attacking non-stop for 5 minutes and 17 seconds, but the referee gave him 1 point against 2 points to his opponent. There was 45s left and we were sure that our athlete could still win points, because his superiority in the match was obvious.\n\n\nThe fans didn't accept the unfair treatment. They grew anxious and angry, and so the Armenian-Georgian dispute broke out. The match went on and we didn't want to stop it. However, the referee did stop it. I was the assistant and Gevorg Aleksanyan was the coach. Some people suddenly began pushing him. Artur saw that and left the mat. He was out for 30 seconds when I noticed him and immediately told him to go back, as wrestlers mustn't leave until the match if finished.\n\n\nArtur didn't do anything in that half-minute. He simply tried to calm everyone down so he could continue the match. He didn't touch anyone. The referees used his short absence as a reason to gift the victory to the Georgian athlete.\n\n\nWe spoke with the instructor from United World Wrestling, a Turk. Even Georgians present insisted the decision was unfair. Nothing changed, though, because they already had a pretext of Artur stepping off the mat.\n\n\nI don't think this will affect Aleksanyan. He didn't do anything; he even congratulated his opponent and took part in the award ceremony. If United World Wrestling tries to disqualify him, that will cast serious doubts over its credibility. As for our federation, government and the National Olympic Committee, I hope they will take measures. I believe this won't affect Artur's future performance."}

Nikkei, which has accurately reported news about Nintendo's unannounced plans before, says Nintendo is ending production on Wii U hardware so soon due to the console's slow sales, which are not expected to improve.\n\nThe report, translated by GameSpot and DualShockers, does not contain any details on when the NX will launch or when Nintendo plans to stop selling Wii U hardware to consumers.\n\nA newly substantiated rumor suggests the NX--believed to be a console/mobile hybrid that uses \"industry-leading\" tech--will launch later this year. It has also been reported that the new Legend of Zelda game for Wii U may also be released for the NX, possibly as a launch title.\n\nWe have reached out to Nintendo in an attempt to get more details and will update this post with anything we hear back.\n\nIt's no secret that the Wii U has come up short. The system, which went on sale in November 2012, has sold 12.6 million units around the world as of December 31. This compares to more than 101 million units sold for the Wii. The Wii, of course, was a massive, global hit, and matching that success was always going to be a challenge for the Wii U.\n\nComparing the Wii U against its current competitors, things don't look great, either. Despite launching a full year earlier, the Wii U has been dramatically outsold by the PlayStation 4, which has moved nearly 36 million units by Sony's latest count. Microsoft does not share Xbox One sales numbers, but the console is rumored to have sold more than 18 million units.\n\nOfficially, Nintendo has said it will talk about the NX--and presumably reveal its actual name--later this year. One possible venue for the announcement would be E3 2016 in June, though Nintendo has yet to announce its plans for the show.\n\nBack in October 2015, The Wall Street Journal reported that Nintendo had started to send out software development kits to some developers, seemingly signalling the company was preparing for launch.\n\nAs always, we'll report back with more information on Nintendo's NX as it becomes available."}

Then a second report was made of what appeared to be \"a Marine recruit running across the airfield toward the terminals,\" said Harbor PD Lt.

Two barbed-wire fences separate the depot from the airport's runways.\n\nPolice say the man was seen running across a runway toward gate six in the Southwest terminal.\n\nPolice went to the runway and found the man hiding inside a janitorial van that he had backed up, resulting in a collision with a Southwest airline tug-a small cart used to transport luggage. Police surrounded the van, ordered him out and handcuffed the marine. Cuts were found on the man's arms from jumping the barbed-wire fence.\n\nABC News affiliate 10 News-KGTV said the suspect was taken to the Naval Medical Center San Diego, where he underwent medical and psychological evaluations.\n\nPolice confirmed the man is a 22-year-old Marine Corps recruit from San Rafael, Calif.

{"text": "The latest release of Australian unemployment data has largely caught economists, and by extension the market, sharply by surprise.\n\nIn fact, rather than coming in at the forecasted 5.9% the unemployment rate actually declined to 5.7% in April. Subsequently, the labor market appears to be going through resurgence but just how robust the current gains are remains to be seen, Economic Calendar reported.\n\nThe employment change figures for April showed a gain of around 37.4k jobs, which followed on from a rise of 60k in March. Obviously, this is a welcome strengthening of the labor market and should lead to some inflationary gains over the medium term. However, the headline rate was a little less impressive with full time positions declining by nearly 11.6k in April. Subsequently, the rise in part-time employment is a relatively concerning trend in the Australian economy.\n\nIn fact, the total hours worked metric declined by around 0.3% whilst part time employment has risen by over 111,300 positions in the past year. This all highlights the underlying reasons why the unemployment rate and job gain figures can be somewhat misleading. It also goes some of the way to explaining why there has been little in the way of systemic inflation over the past year, despite some strong gains in the employment numbers.\n\nHowever, despite the employment figures being somewhat unreliable as a macroeconomic indicator, the results are likely to be noticed by the Reserve Bank of Australia. In fact, there is a view that the recent gains may actually see the central bank delaying a potential cut to interest rates given the risk of inflationary pressures arriving down the line.\n\nSubsequently, the next RBA meeting is likely to see the central bank holding rates at 1.50% for the tenth consecutive meeting. Lending further support to this view is the increasing domestic debt levels, largely to do with the housing bubble, that the central bank are very clearly concerned with. Subsequently, cutting rates further, and by extension, providing a looser credit environment is likely to not be particularly high on the RBA's agenda.\n\nUltimately, although the falling unemployment rate is likely to be relatively welcome news to the Australian public, It hides deeper issues around the appropriateness of part time employment and what impact this will have on inflation in the medium term."}

{"text": "The American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Louisiana have filed a federal lawsuit against a public school in Sabine Parish that harassed a non-Christian student and has a long history of proselytizing students and promoting religion. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of two parents, Scott and Sharon Lane, and their three children, including their son, C.C., who is a Buddhist of Thai heritage.\n\nAccording to the complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, C.C enrolled in Negreet High School, which serves students in kindergarten through twelfth grade, earlier this year as a sixth-grader and quickly became the target of harassment by school staff. His science teacher, Rita Roark, repeatedly taught students that the Earth was created by God 6,000 years ago, that evolution is \"impossible,\" and that the Bible is \"100 percent true.\"\n\nRoark also regularly features religious questions on her tests such as \"ISN'T IT AMAZING WHAT THE _____________ HAS MADE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" When C.C. did not write in Roark's expected answer, \"LORD,\" she belittled him in front of the rest of the class. While studying other religions, Roark has told students that Buddhism is \"stupid.\"\n\nWhen Plaintiffs objected, Sabine Parish Superintendent, Sara Ebarb, told them that \"this is the Bible belt.\" She suggested that C.C. should \"change\" his faith or transfer to another district school 25 miles away where, in her words, \"there are more Asians.\" Ultimately, C.L.'s parents did transfer him to another school to protect him, but school officials at that school also unconstitutionally promote religion.\n\nBeyond Roark's classroom, the school also regularly incorporates official Christian prayer into class and school events. School officials display religious iconography through hallways and classrooms, including a large portrait of Jesus Christ, and an electronic marquee in front of the school scrolls Bible verses as students enter the building.\n\nThe lawsuit asks the court to issue an order prohibiting the school district from continuing to promote religion or disparage Plaintiffs' faith and to require the district to reimburse the Lanes for the cost of transporting C.C. to another school."}

Phew.\n\nFire Emblem: Fates has its predecessor to thank for its existence.\n\nIn a recent edition of Iwata asks (via Destructoid), Nintendo President Satoru Iwata spoke with some of the people involved in the development of Fire Emblem: Fates.\n\nIt was during this conversation that Nintendo producer Hitoshi Yamagami revealed Fire Emblem: Awakening was actually supposed to be the final game in the franchise.\n\n\"To be honest, when we made Awakening, we intended it to be the last in the series,\" Yamagami said, adding that Nintendo's then senior managing director and head of sales Shinji Hatano presented them with news of the franchise's dwindling numbers.\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\"Hatano-san, who was working as the head of the sales department, he said 'The Emblem series isn't making the numbers, so this is going to be the last one.' And the [development team] members said 'This is going to be the last one, so let's put in everything we want so we don't have any regrets.' Then we had a big list of different things, 'I want to do this' and 'I wanna do this,' and the result was Awakening.\"\n\nAccording to Iwata, Awakening went on to become \"the bestselling game in the Emblem series overseas.\" This success, Yamagami noted, eventually led to Hatano asking about their plans for a new installment.\n\n\"We asked, 'Huh? I thought this was supposed to be the last one?' And [Hatano] said, 'Of course. That's how Sales works. If something sells, we start asking for the next installment.' So we talked to everyone at Intelligent Systems and said, 'So, now we have to hurry up and make the next one.'\"\n\nNintendo announced during E3 2015 that Fire Emblem Fates (known as Fire Emblem If in Japan) will release on the Nintendo 3DS in 2016. Fates also recently made headlines by becoming the first in the Fire Emblem series to allow for same-sex marriages.\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\nCassidee is a freelance writer and the co-host of a podcast about freelancing.

{"text": "As I said, the new FP25 at Costco is identical to the FP30, but with one exception...the FP30 has a couple of Bluetooth wireless functions for connecting to iPad & Android devices, and the FP25 does not. You can connect from the FP25 to external devices but you would just use a USB cable and special connector for the device to connect with your piano, and then you can use many apps. But this is also true with most all digital pianos that allow you to connect to an external device with a USB/MIDI cable. Also the Roland FP25 includes the normally optional furniture style stand and triple pedal-bar whereas the FP30 does not. You would need to purchase those accessories at an extra cost which would bring the price of the FP30 with stand, pedals, & headphones (the headphones are basic cheap headphones) above $799. However, for nearly all states in the US you would also need to pay local/state sales tax on Costco purchases which would then bring the price back up to being the same as buying the FP30 on-line at a variety of Roland internet dealer stores.\nAlthough I do like the new Roland FP25/FP30, you really are not saving money on the FP25 over buying the FP30 version on-line at a regular Roland internet store. Also, there are other very popular digital piano models in this price range that may even be a better purchase than the FP25 depending on your musical goals and what you would like out of a digital piano. Two of those pianos are the Kawai ES100 ($699US without stand & triple pedal) and the Casio CGP700 ($799 with stand but no triple pedal). Most people who play piano, especially beginners, do not need the triple pedal unit. A single sustain pedal is normally more than enough to play piano and single pedals do come with the other digital pianos at no charge. Take a look at my reviews of the Kawai ES100 and Casio CGP700, and FP30 at the following links: Roland FP30 Review Kawai ES100 Review Casio CGP700 Review If you want more info on new digital pianos and LOWER PRICES than internet discounts, please email me at tim@azpianowholesale.com or call direct at 602-571-1864 ."}

The rift led to the killing of several known leaders from both factions.\n\nThe reaffirmists of Sison wanted to continue its main tactic of protracted people's war, while the rejectionists led by workers' leader Filemon \"Popoy\" Lagman clamored for armed insurrection in the cities to grab power.\n\nLagman had critiqued Sison's book \"Philippine Society and Revolution\" and argued that Philippine society was capitalist in a backward and underdeveloped way, rather than being semifeudal and semicolonial as Sison had contended.\n\nLagman believed that a workers-led revolution in the city must be waged to dismantle capitalism, rather than a protracted people's war from the countryside.\n\nThe RJ groups and some NDFP leaders later declared autonomy from the CCP, resulting in a split that decimated the number of the party's supporters and fighters.

The Formula One teams with tobacco-related sponsorship lose part of their revenue when a certain percentage of the events ban tobacco sponsorship. This was the reason the Belgium Grand Prix was not included in the 2003 calendar,\" Ecclestone said.\n\nThe A1 Ring in Austria also bade farewell to Formula One this year as Ecclestone last month terminated his contract for next season due to the country's backing of EU legislation against tobacco advertising, which takes effect in 2005.\n\nTopics: motor-sports, formula-1, canada\n\nFirst posted"}

{"text": "Heavy rains this year have done everything from flood roads to delay progress on one of the area's most anticipated tollway openings, but Houston is receiving relatively little in terms of infrastructure relief.\n\nThe Federal Highway Administration last week announced $410 million was headed to states to help repair and recover damaged roads. The money is handed out annually as part of emergency allocations, and covers storms from 2015, as well as cleanup from previous years where claims are still being settled. Money is used primarily to rebuild or repair roads and bridges.\n\n\"Emergency relief funding is an integral part of the federal-aid program,\" said Federal Highway Administrator Gregory Nadeau, in a news release. \"Part of our mission is to help states get back on track by restoring broken transportation links when disaster strikes.\"\n\nAbout $9.88 million of the money is coming to Texas for state-maintained roads, all related to storms in May that washed out highways and caused days of cleanup work.\n\nDespite water pouring onto Houston-area roads, Texas Department of Transportation officials said Friday that $146,000 in claims were filed in the Houston area, mostly cleanup-related work in central Houston and Waller County. A $44,000 claim was filed for cameras and related traffic management systems damaged during the Memorial Day weekend storms.\n\nCompared to other parts of the state, TxDOT spokeswoman Veronica Beyer said Houston's damages to state roads were minimal.\n\nNationwide, two areas hardest hit by storms represent more than half the federal emergency spending. Flooding in September 2013 severely damaged roads between Denver and Boulder, Colo., leading to $115.5 million in emergency relief. New York and New Jersey, still rebuilding damaged from Hurricane Sandy, received $92 million in federal aid.\n\nTexas, which got a late fall round of heavy rains, could apply for more relief, if warranted. A round of storms in late October submerged 330 spots on 232 state-maintained roads, according to reports, including a more than 10-mile segment of Interstate 45 between Houston and Dallas.\n\nAt the time, analysts predicted those storms could mean hundreds of millions of dollars in damages for state roads. So far, claims have been far below those estimates, which also consider costs that would not be covered by federal aid, such as economic loss from having roads closed."}

The infection with high risk HPV types can leads to anal cancer.\n\nHPV is a known cause of cervical cancer and genital warts in women, but it also can cause of ano-genital warts and anal cancer in men, and then lead to anal cancer. It can be prevented by a quadrivalent HPV vaccine\n\nIn Thai MSM who do not have HIV, the infection rate of HPV is still 58%. Anal HPV infection is much higher in HIV-positive MSM than in those who do not have HIV.\n\nShe recommends that risk groups should take an \"anal pap smear\" which can screen for abnormal cells in the anus, and may give early warning of possible pre-cancerous or cancerous anal lesions.\n\nAssociate Professor Mongkol Benjapibal from Division of Gynaecologic Oncology at Siriraj Hospital, also noted that HPV vaccinations of males can reduce HPV infection rates because men are carriers of HPV.\n\nHe said a study of young men showed that vaccine can prevent up to 78% of anal cancer cases. HPV vaccination is safe and shows a 91% efficiency rate in men.Only quadrivalent HPV vaccine is currently approved by Thai Food and Drug Administration for males.\n\nTo stop the spread of HPV in Australia, for instance, school boys have begun receiving this vaccine to protect against cancers and diseases caused by HPV."}

With a box cutter by someone who was bigger and stronger than she was.\n\nAfter school, the accused murderer, Philip Chism, followed her into the girls bathroom. The \"whys\" of what happened are still being investigated, whether this was a rage killing or attempted rape has not yet been discovered but one thing was for certain, Ms. Ritzer was beaten and stabbed and never left that bathroom alive.\n\nVideo from the school showed Chism rolling a recycling bin through the school and it was found near where he dumped her body.\n\nMy question to the school and to the state of Massachusetts was, \"how exactly was Ms. Ritzer supposed to survive?\"\n\nShe was in a confined space, cornered with no place to escape, where an armed attacker who was bigger and stronger than she was began to beat her before pulling out a box cutter (which are against the rules to have in school) and ended her life.\n\nIf she was allowed to exercise her 2nd Amendment rights, if she was armed with a small handgun the size of her palm\n\ncould she have fought back and lived? Yes…she could have. Though nothing is certain she definitely wouldn't be any worse off than she is now.\n\nUnfortunately, Ms. Ritzer didn't have that choice. In Massachusetts, like schools in most states, she is denied her right to choose and as such the war on women that gun controllers wage continues. Wherever women are disarmed they will be targets and victims to those who are bigger and stronger.\n\nGun Rights at its core is about equality. Gun Control on the other hand, fosters a world where someone big and strong can murder with a box cutter, or a hammer, or a screwdriver anyone who is smaller and weaker than they are. Even David was given a sling to shoot Goliath…lest that story have a very different ending.\n\nWhile gun controllers would prefer to live in a world without guns, where rapists and murderers can do as they please to the smaller and weaker without fear of being stopped, I prefer to live in a world with more dead rapists shot by their would-be victims.\n\nRelated articles"}
{"text": "You know what's hilarious? When people who clearly have no experience with superhero lore make up rules about superhero stuff.\n\nAn imgur user posted a photo of a letter her friend's daughter brought home from school:\n\nThe photo at the top of this post is the front of the offending lunchbox. And here is the back:\n\nWhat concerns me more than a little girl being deprived of the chance to pay homage to a worthy fictional role model is the idea that \"violent images,\" \"violent characters,\" and \"superheroes\" are all conflated without context. I understand not wanting to have violent images in a school around children. And if the offending lunchbox had Wonder Woman in a fight (or if other superhero lunchboxes actually featured, say, Iron Man shooting someone with his repulsor blasts, or Superman punching someone), this would make a whole lot more sense.\n\nBut this lunchbox has a picture of Wonder Woman's face on one side, and on the other a full-body picture of her flying while extolling her beauty and wisdom. Two very non-violent qualities. What's more, she's holding her Lasso of Truth, which she never uses as a weapon.\n\nHowever, even more nonsensical is their blanket ban on \"violent characters\" who \"solve problems using violence,\" when anyone who's ever actually picked up a comic book knows that most superheroes 1) turn to violence as a last resort, and usually in self-defense, or when the lives of others are in danger, 2) don't want to kill anyone, and 3) often have other skills that make them so \"super\" and are worth looking up to (Batman's power of deduction, Superman's belief in humanity, Wonder Woman's love of peace).\n\nIt's sad to me that, whenever children are concerned, rather than actually engaging with the material – or with the children themselves – when determining what's best for them or not, adults in positions of power too often take the easy way out, creating blanket bans rather than respecting children enough to deal in ideas and provide them with context.\n\n(via @auntiesiannan on Twitter)\n\n—Please make note of The Mary Sue's general comment policy.—\n\nDo you follow The Mary Sue on Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Pinterest, & Google +?"}

Host Anita Sarkeesian sends the show out with little fanfare, focusing the final installment on the sorry state of \"lady sidekicks\" in games.\n\nThis episode looks at games like BioShock Infinite, Ico and Resident Evil 4 to highlight how female companions \"often function as cheerleaders\" for stronger, more capable male leads.\n\n\"These interactions are rarely depicted as mutually supportive,\" Sarkeesian explains after running through clips of familiar AI-controlled, distressed damsels. \"It's not nearly as common in these scenarios for the male player character to offer emotional support to their female sidekick, to tell her that she's doing a great job. These particular sidekicks aren't designed as characters that players can actively engage in developing a relationship with, characters who are fully fleshed-out people with their own goals and desires that sometimes require players to compromise their own wants or desires.\"\n\nGames have gotten better in this regard in recent years, Sarkeesian says. The Last of Us and its expansion, Left Behind, enable women to protect themselves and each other. Even the dog-like Trico from The Last Guardian shows growth when it comes to designing companions for playable male characters; he's the one offering protection to the at-times helpless lead, as opposed to the other way around.\n\nThus marks the end of Tropes vs. Women's second season, which began earlier last year. Sarkeesian and crew recently wrapped Ordinary Women, a new series which broadens the scope to important female figures from throughout history.\n\nUpdate: Sarkeesian reflected upon making the entire Tropes vs. Women series in a follow-up blog post.\n\n\"This is one of the most emotionally complicated projects I've ever created. It has been simultaneously awful and wonderful, and the journey is one which I will most certainly never forget,\" she wrote. \"One that would never have happened without the incredible and generous support of our nearly 7000 Kickstarter backers, and countless others who encouraged us along the way.\"\n\nThe post recounts the history of the show, as well as gathers up all of its episodes in one place. Sarkeesian also noted that Feminist Frequency will return with another, different series soon."}
{"text": "US does not have to hand over all its evidence against Dotcom and three colleagues, says appeals court in New Zealand\n\nUS prosecutors have won a court case that brings them a step closer in their attempts to have the Megaupload founder and three of his colleagues extradited from New Zealand.\n\nThe appeals court in Wellington overturned an earlier ruling that would have allowed Kim Dotcom and the others broad access to evidence in the case against them at the time of their extradition hearing, which is scheduled for August. The four are accused of facilitating massive copyright fraud through the internet filesharing site.\n\nThe court ruled that extensive disclosure would bog down the process and that a summary of the US case would suffice.\n\nDotcom, a German national, says he is innocent and cannot be held responsible for others using the site to illegally download songs and films. Along with him, US prosecutors are seeking the extraditions of Finn Batato, Mathias Ortmann and Bram van der Kolk, each of whom held senior positions at Megaupload before American authorities shut the site down in 2012.\n\nPaul Davison, one of Dotcom's lawyers, said he planned to appeal at New Zealand's supreme court. Dotcom's legal team must first submit an application to the court which will then decide whether an appeal has enough merit to proceed.\n\nIn its ruling the appeals court found that full disclosure of evidence was not necessary at the extradition hearing because the hearing was not the venue to determine guilt or innocence. The court pointed out that the legal obligation on the US was simply to prove it had a valid case.\n\nThe court also found that extradition treaties are essentially agreements between governments and \"even though courts play a vital part in the process, extradition is very much a government to government process\".\n\nDavison said it was vital that Dotcom had access to a wide range of documents including those that could be detrimental to the US case. The lawyer said that would help prove there was no merit to the case.\n\nThe extradition hearing has already been postponed from March to August owing to the legal wrangling. It could be postponed further should the supreme court decide to hear the next planned appeal.\n\nDotcom remains on bail pending the hearing. In January, on the anniversary of his arrest, he launched a new filesharing site called Mega."}

{"text": "Feminist Tumblr is about many things, but in general it's about young women who hate the whole world and everyone in it. Marina is an \"intersectional feminist and a human rights advocate\" who hates the whole world because everybody is sexist and she recounts the various hassles she must endure before she finally blows up and calls her boss \"a sexist a–hole,\" which is not her fault:\n\nthis is what sexism does – it makes it impossible to win if you're a girl, or a woman, it makes your entire existance an uphill battle. and truth be told, i am getting so f–king tired. i am 23, a quarter of my life behind me, and i am already tired of educating men twice my age about what is right and appropriate. i am tired of the stares that say i am over-reacting, the replies to calm down, the polite smiles that are meant to knock me down a few pegs. i am tired of explaining to men that sexism is not this one incident, it is my entire life, my every single day. i am 23 and i am so f–king exhausted.\n\nSee? She needs to educate us about \"what is right and appropriate\" because she is 23 and an expert on everything, while the rest of us (especially men twice her age) are clueless idiots.\n\nThis is why we cannot simply laugh at feminism's death-grip on college education. Young women emerge from the protective campus cocoon — where no one is permitted to criticize feminism — and enter a world where most people don't spend their days worrying about \"human rights\" and \"intersectionality.\" In the real world, people have work to do and bills to pay, and the last thing they need is for some young fanatic fresh out of college, hired for an entry-level position, to go crazy in the office because somebody made a joke she didn't like.\n\nFeminism makes women unemployable.\n\nA paranoid worldview that perceives misogyny and social injustice everywhere renders feminists incapable of functioning in normal life. Because success in the real world requires cooperation and teamwork, a hostile chip-on-your-shoulder attitude is no more conducive to professional success than it is to personal happiness.\n\nOne more thing, sweetheart: You misspelled \"existence.\"\n\nComments"}
{"text": "A lot of people comming here to complain about Titan without having a Titan as main class.. it's kinda fun... Titan are supposed to be a tank, that's why their strafing is definetely slower compared to other classes, just as their single jump... they can move fast... in a straight line with a single chance to change path expending shoulder charge without using twilight garrison, making them easy target for snipers. The problem is, if I want to play a tank.. I would go for a warlock as I can have shield by just hit the enemy with my sniper melee ;) Titans CANT receive the extra ammount of damage they should due their lack of mobility because they dont have enough extra life/armor whateaver that could protect them. And by mobility here i'm talking about running of bullets in the middle of a gunfight, not jump with full speed in a straight line! Or skating for the side without being able to effectively using your gun during it. And that's why most people plays with Hunters and Warlocks, as playing with a Titan puts you in a great disvantage overall. I really agree that it's stupid Juggernault protect you against an HS for exemple, I think juggernault should be reviewed, but complaining about titan skating is a joke! Shoulder charge was not working as intended before, lets divide by 3 the moments of shoulder charge. The moment the animation starts warning you you can land a shoulder charge we are having the current issues: 1/3 of the time if you land a shoulder charge you will likely ending by punching the air instead of shoulder charging, 2/3 you will be able to land the shoulder charge, 3/3 you will most likely to punch your enemy instead of hit him with shoulder charge. The animation and the time are not exactly fitting, me and more titans felt it. The worst is when you're skating and your shoulder charge dosn't go as expected is that you lost momentum, speed and, depending of your situation it means death on crucible. I noted issues with the titan jump. The jump is slower and with less reach, but the main problem is that it's not being canceled as it should, I confirmed it isn't my controller as more people is having the same issue. Having Titan as main class here.. I can only say that the whole class should be reviewed."}
{"text": "If the last few Jeopardy! episodes have felt a little more emotionally heavy than normal, it might be because one of the contestants—a woman named Cindy Stowell—died just last week after a battle with colon cancer. As explained by a post on the Jeopardy! website, Stowell had passed the online eligibility test early this year, but when she found out the show had invited her to an in-person audition in the summer, she had to let the producers know about her cancer diagnosis. The Jeopardy! site shared a chunk of the message she sent, and it's pretty touching all on its own:\n\nDo you have any idea how long it typically takes between an in person interview, and the taping date? I ask because I just found out that I don't have too much longer to live. The doctor's best guess is about six months. If there is the chance that I'd be able to still tape episodes of Jeopardy! if I were selected, I'd like to do that and donate any winnings to…charities involved in cancer research. If it is unlikely that the turnaround time would be that quick, then I'd like to give up my tryout spot to someone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeopardy! producer Maggie Speak talked it over with the show's other producers, and they told Stowell that if she passed the audition, they'd book her for the earliest taping they possibly could. Three weeks later, she filmed her first Jeopardy! episode—which finally aired yesterday—and won, unseating a seven-day champion and winning $22,001 for cancer research in the process. Stowell went on to defend her title in the episode airing today.\n\nOnly host Alex Trebek and some of the producers knew she was sick during the taping, and the Jeopardy! site shared a message from Trebek:\n\nWhen Cindy Stowell taped her appearance on Jeopardy!, she had Stage 4 cancer. Competing on Jeopardy! was a lifelong dream for Cindy, and we're glad she was able to do so. Sadly, Cindy died on December 5. Our condolences and best wishes to her family and friends.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can see a simultaneously thrilling and heartbreaking video of Stowell's win below:\n\n[via Buzzfeed]"}

The Enquirer has obtained renderings that show various renovations to the building including the rearranging of some seating, but the exact new capacity is not known.\n\nThe Enquirer has previously reported that capacity could be reduced to 10,000, but that information has not been released. The project will not be an expansion but rather a renovation.\n\nRenderings of the renovations expected to be approved by UC. (Photo: Provided/University of Cincinnati)\n\nThe UC Board of Trustees is expected to approve the project soon, possibly at its next meeting in August. The project will be paid for with private funds and some fundraising already is in progress, sources told The Enquirer.\n\nWork is expected to begin immediately after the Bearcats complete the 2015-16 basketball season, meaning possibly sometime around April 2016. UC would have to leave Fifth Third Arena for the 2016-17 season, with US Bank Arena and Cincinnati Gardens among several possibilities considered as a temporary home. It is expected that UC basketball will return to its campus arena for the 2017-18 season.\n\nThe plan would include a 360-degree seating bowl, and would replace the current rollaway bleachers with permanent seats. A new roof is planned along with upgrades to concessions, lighting and the heating and cooling systems. Retail kiosks for fans will be located in the upper bowl. Many upper level bench seats will be replaced with chairback seating.\n\nUC athletic director Mike Bohn could not immediately be reached for comment. Bohn and some UC staffers visited the Gardens on a fact-finding tour last month.\n\nUC also is in the midst of an $86 million renovation and expansion of its Nippert Stadium football facility, which is expected to reopen for the 2015 Bearcats football season on Sept. 5 against Alabama A&M."}
{"text": "The arrow flying toward the beating heart of net neutrality just traveled another inch.\n\nOn Thursday, the Senate committee that authorizes federal spending approved a bill that takes aim at the FCC's net neutrality rules, setting the stage for another in a long line of skirmishes over the future of the open Internet.\n\nThe bill, which funds a host of government agencies for the upcoming fiscal year, passed the Senate Appropriations Committee 16-14, despite objections from Democrats who opposed, among other things, its restrictions on how the Federal Communications Commission could spend its budget.\n\nIf the Senate bill becomes part of Congress' final budget, it will give the FCC $320 million, a $20-million reduction from last year. It will also forbid the FCC from spending any of that money to regulate the cost of Internet access.\n\nOpen-Internet groups and liberal senators have been pushing the FCC to use its new net-neutrality rules to scrutinize Internet prices, but congressional Republicans don't want the commission intervening in what they consider a fairly functioning market.\n\n\"We are disappointed by today's vote and wish more senators had voted to support consumers and small businesses,\" said Joshua Stager, Policy Counsel for New America's Open Technology Institute. \"As currently drafted, the bill jeopardizes Internet freedom and handcuffs the FCC's ability to protect online innovation.\"\n\nDemocrats on the Appropriations Committee attacked the FCC provision and warned that it could have far-reaching consequences.\n\nThe bill \"is written so broadly it could potentially undermine central net neutrality protections and tie the FCC's hands on a slew of other consumer abuses,\" Sen.

{"text": "By Sahil Patel\n\nIgnore, for a second, about how more and more producers are creating content for digital platforms. Hollywood studios and networks — those still generating most of their revenue from traditional films and TV shows — are also increasingly adapting to digital, because they have to.\n\nIf you need just one statistic to explain why, how's this: Revenues from US subscription VOD streaming services like Netflix and Amazon topped $1.9 billion in the first half of 2014, representing a 26.17% increase from the previous year. Revenues from electronic sell-through services like iTunes totaled $671 million, growing 36.84% since 2013.\n\nThese numbers (and the chart) are courtesy of eMarketer, which pulled data from a report released by the Digital Entertainment Group earlier this month.\n\nBy itself, the data shouldn't be surprising. Netflix has been reporting higher subscriber and revenue numbers for quite some time now, because consumers are increasingly flocking to digital services to discover or rewatch films and TV shows.\n\nWhat makes all this more compelling, though, is how digital compares to the more traditional means of distributing and redistributing content. According to Digital Entertainment Group, SVOD and EST were the only two formats to see a positive change in revenue from the previous year. Brick and mortar? Down 32.68%. Rental excluding video-on-demand? Down 14.55%. Rental with VOD included? Negative 11.4%. Traditional VOD by itself? Minus 5.63%.\n\nThis is why you're seeing initiatives like the UltraViolet digital locker service, or TV's attempt at \"TV Everywhere,\" or studios experimenting with multi-platform release models for some films.\n\nInterestingly enough, this is also why content costs continue to rise for digital outlets like Netflix and Amazon, and why both have, as a result, ventured into creating original programming.\n\nMore and more people are watching movies and TV shows. But less and less are interested in always watching this content the way they historically have. It's one of the reasons why box-office numbers have been down this summer, and why the 2014 upfront market was pretty weak.\n\nGive viewers what they want when they want it — it's a popular refrain in the industry, but as the numbers are beginning to reflect, it's also true."}
{"text": "SK Exclusive: WWE spent $5 million on WrestleMania 33 set\n\nHarry Kettle FOLLOW FEATURED WRITER News 8.37K // 19 Apr 2017, 19:52 IST SHARE Share Options × Facebook Twitter Flipboard Reddit Google+ Email\n\nThey outdid themselves once again\n\nWhat's the story?\n\nOur sources are reporting that WWE spent a grand total of $5 million on the stage for WrestleMania 33 in Orlando, Florida. The event was a massive success for the company with many fans calling the production behind the Showcase of the Immortals the best of all time.\n\nIn case you didn't know...\n\nWWE had a lot of pressure on its shoulders heading into 'Mania this year, with a large portion of the WWE Universe slating the event before it had even begun. Plus, the previous set that was constructed for the Citrus Bowl's last WrestleMania back in 2008 was so fantastic that many fans wanted to see the company try and top that effort.\n\nThe heart of the matter\n\nAs we previously mentioned, our sources have suggested that the official total for the stage was around $5 million. This amount likely eclipses any fee that the WWE have paid in the past when it comes to their production, and you can see why it was so expensive. The complexity of the stage was one of the reasons why it was so popular, with the general consensus being that it did in fact defeat Mania 24's set.\n\nAlso read: WWE sacrificed over $6 million for WrestleMania Rollercoaster stage\n\nWhat's next?\n\nWe are less than twelve months away from next year's edition of WrestleMania, which will emanate from the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. It's unlikely that they'll spend anywhere near this year's amount given that it's a domed stadium, although with that being said WrestleMania 30's simple design was quite effective.\n\nAuthor's take\n\nHowever much it cost, the money they paid was worth it because that stage was absolutely extraordinary. As someone who was there live, the production was magnificent from start to finish, and it gave this year's WrestleMania that special feeling that can only stem from such a Herculean effort. Bravo, WWE.\n\nSend us news tips at fightclub@sportskeeda.com"}

The spring peeper has a white or cream colored belly and webbed feet with sticky toe pads that it uses to cling to trees and plants. Although the spring peeper is a tree frog and a good tree climber, it spends a lot of time on the ground! Range The spring peeper is found in most of the eastern United States and Canada, including New Hampshire.\n\nHabitat The spring peeper is found in marshy woodlands, ponds, and swamps. Diet The spring peeper eats small insects like flies, beetles, ants, and spiders. Life Cycle The spring peeper first mates when it is three years old. Mating season begins in March and can last through June. The female lays up to 1,000 eggs on twigs and leaf litter in shallow water. The eggs hatch in 6-12 days. The tadpoles begin to change into frogs in the late summer. The spring peeper spends the winter hibernating under logs or under the loose bark of a tree. Behavior The spring peeper gets its name from its call. In the spring, males perch on grasses, sedges, and branches near water and call out for mates with a high pitched, single note \"peep\" that they repeat 15-25 times a minute. Usually, more than one peeper calls at the same time, and their calls sound like jingling bells. In some places, the sound of spring peepers is seen as one of the first signs of spring! Some people mistake the call for a cricket call, but crickets are usually not heard in the early spring. Only the male spring peeper makes the peeping call."}
{"text": "Like in August , I processed the downloaded Dotlan data for September 2015. Let's see the ratting charts first: Well, well, the fruits of years of continous neglecting of highsec are now obvious: there are less PvE activity in highsec than in nullsec. While nullsec ratting increased a bit it's not the reason for the change but quick decrease of highsec activity. And you know what correlates very well with highsec PvE activity. The most bizarre result of this change can be seen on Dotlan : Goons are now literally the biggest carebears of New Eden. While they are ratting more than ever, the main reason of the change is the serious decrease in highsec, as Deklein only increased by 0.9M: The most important is to see how quickly Providence returned to their high position in ratting. Let's see the alliances: Goons reached their record so far, due to Deklein being down on the CFC loss list (beaten by Vale and Pure Blind). Their ratting concentration is 4x higher than the Nullsec average, showing that CCP made a serious mistake listening to the Document of Shame , a joint venture of Nullsec overlords to remove conflict from Nullsec. With the increased anomaly count there is absolutely no reason to take the land of another group, there are enough anoms for 4x more nullsec people than current, not just as a theoretical possibility, but as an everyday practice. I'd suggest to decrease anom count in all systems to 1/4 of current. Soviet-Union continues its march up the chart, now being #3 ratter. The xxDeath renters are not only down but extremely underutilizig their space, just like B0T renters, but at least they are a bit up. Razor and CVA both returned to pre-war ratting while xxDeath proper decreased their activity. September was record for the Imperium in absolute numbers, but as it was huge for whole nullsec, their percentage record is still May. These are obviously not the numbers I want to see but since CCP completely removed conflict from nullsec, we can't hope that any other Sov owner will fight them (see how Providence attempted no retaliation for the earlier Imperium attacks). We must wait (and send support) until MoA grows to the point where they alone can make ratting impossible in Deklein."}

{"text": "United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) officials have reviewed recent evidence and say that the tortoise is not presently at risk and won't receive Endangered Species Act (ESA) protection.\n\nFWS research suggests that, at present, 470,000 to 970,000 adult tortoises currently live in the Sonoran Desert. The agency stated that the numbers are due in part to ongoing and longterm efforts by the US and Mexican governments and the state of Arizona.\n\nThe finding is due in part to longterm commitments to continued proactive efforts between federal agencies and Arizona Game and Fish Department, in identifying and addressing the primary threats to the tortoise. The Service utilized a robust scientific analysis of the desert tortoise status and current and future threats and concluded it does not face extinction now or in the foreseeable future.\n\n\"This is yet another example of the power of the ESA in inspiring successful collaborations between states, landowners and federal agencies on behalf of America's most imperiled wildlife. When you combine this with other recent efforts culminating in not-warranted findings, such as the New England cottontail, greater sage-grouse and others, it is clear that the ESA is accomplishing its intended purpose in a flexible and collaborative way,\" said FWS director Dan Ashe in a statement.\n\nThe tortoise originally became a candidate for protection in 2010. At that time, FWS officials found that the animal's habitat was under threat due to increasing human populations in the region. However, ongoing efforts since that time and a classification by the state as a \"species of greatest conservation need\" have kept the population stable.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press some environmental groups remain concerned about the ruling. Tylor Jones of WildEarth Guardians said that the group wants to see the animals reliably protected. Jones is not convinced however that voluntary agreements will be enforceable. She added that her group is reviewing the FWS report but has not ruled out legal action at this time.\n\n\"We and our federal and state partners will continue to monitor the tortoises. However the current modeling in science demonstrates that there's virtually no probability of extinction over the next decade,\" said FWS spokesperson Jeff Humphrey.\n\nAccording to the report, the current evaluation of the tortoise's numbers included input from public and private sector experts as well as \"geospatial and population viability\" computer modelling."}
{"text": "This post goes out to those of you who have not yet experienced the pure joy of brewing your morning joe with a Keurig. To those who have wondered just how those little K-cup thingys work and especially to those who have not heard of this new fangled technology at all (you must be living under a rock if you fall in that category!). Keurig brewers are specially designed to extract coffee from a K-cup. A K-cup is a highly engineered, technologically sophisticated mini coffee brewer inside of a very tiny body. K-cups consist of four parts:\n\nThe outer plastic casing. This is a special designed housing that blocks out moisture, light and air allowing your precious coffee to remain perfectly fresh until you are ready to brew it.\n\nA permeable paper filter. The paper filter allows for optimal flavor extraction.\n\nA foil seal. The foil seal keep the coffee air tight and blocks out oxygen and humidity.\n\nK-cups contain a perfectly measured amount of coffee creating a consistent brew cup after cup.\n\nTo brew coffee with a Keurig, the first step is to place the K-cup in the brew chamber of the unit. When the handle is pulled down closing the chamber, a small needle will puncture the foil lid of the K-cup penetrating the coffee with pressurized water at high temperature.The coffee is filtered through the paper. At the same time a second needle punctures the bottom of the K-cup, allowing freshly brewed coffee to pour into your mug.\n\nThis video does a nice job of demonstrating the brewing process:\n\nKeurig K-cup technology is incredibly revolutionary yet incredibly simple at the same time. The creators of the Keurig system shrunk coffee brewing down to its smallest form- one cup at a time. The K-cup is really just a tiny little drip style coffee brewer. The concept is exactly the same however, the technology of the Keurig itself is far more sophisticated.\n\nMany have tried to duplicate this technology but few have come close to matching the quality. So many consumers choose to brew their own coffee grinds with special adapters. Although they seem like a cost saver up front, we have yet to find one that operates as easily and tastes as good as a genuine Kcup.\n\nIf you are reading this article you may also be interested in:"}
{"text": "If rarity is a criterion of how valuable a mineral is, diamond is no match for fingerite. This combination of copper and vanadium figures in a list of 2,500 rarest of the rare minerals, which have, for the first time ever, been painstakingly categorized by researchers from the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C., and the Rockefeller University in New York.\n\n\"Fingerite is like a 'perfect storm of rarity,'\" Robert Hazen, who co-authored a paper, which is set to be published in the latest issue of the journal American Mineralogist, told the BBC. \"It occurs only on the flanks of the Izalco Volcano in El Salvador — an incredibly dangerous place with super-hot fumeroles. ... If you just change the ratio of copper to vanadium slightly, you get a different mineral. And every time it rains, fingerite washes away.\"\n\nAnd fingerite is not the only ephemeral mineral on the planet. Edoylerite, metasideronatrite, and sideronatrite, which also feature in the list of the 2,500 rarest minerals, decompose instantly when exposed to sunlight, while hatrurite — discovered in the Hatrurim Formation in Israel — only forms at a temperature of over 1,250 degrees Celsius (2,282 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\n\"Scientists have so far tracked down 5,000 mineral species and it turns out that fewer than a 100 constitute almost all of Earth's crust. The rest of them are rare, but the rarest of the rare — that's about 2,500 minerals — are only found at five places on Earth or fewer,\" Hazen said.\n\nContrast that to diamonds, which are found in at least 700 locations around the world.\n\nDespite their rarity, or perhaps because of it, these minerals assume special importance for geologists and biologists seeking to understand the creation and evolution of Earth and of life. Scientists believe that many of these rare minerals are a product of biological processes, and could also provide a way to seek out the presence of life on other planets.\n\n\"It's the rare minerals that tell us so much about how Earth differs from the Moon, from Mars, from Mercury, where the same common minerals exist, but it's the rare minerals that make Earth special,\" Hazen told the BBC."}
{"text": "The Call\n\nGod has been working on me for a long-time to share my story; in fact, He has been leading me for most of 2013. In December, I decided to make the leap of conviction and do what I feel called to do.\n\nMy personal resolution is to add at least one post per week during 2014. Moreover, I want my posts to provide an appropriate level of detail, in raw form, about my story. There is both pain and magnificence. There is dishonesty and truth. There is shame and praise. Infidelity is wrong. People get hurt. Living without God can be ugly.\n\nThis is my inaugural post and I debated for a long-time on the topic. Should I start with one or more events? Various emotions? The affairs? A memory or two? The children? Family? Her? Me? Others involved? Humorous moments? This list goes on. However, I concluded that there is no single, best topic. I just need to write and let God lead.\n\nThat said this post is short and simple. Yet, I hope it contains a powerful message that captures many attributes of what happens when infidelity punctures a marriage. This is an audio recording of me attempting to understand what was happening at the time. In this recording, I am trying to speak with one of the men having an affair with my now ex-wife. He is married and has a child. If you listen closely, I did not hang up the phone completely, and you can hear my sighs at the end. He was warned by my ex-wife prior to my call. He never spoke with me. Their names are masked and the voice altered to protect them.\n\nIt may seem obvious, but adultery affects others and breaks up families. I believe that people committing infidelity may overlook that fact, and they may believe they will never get caught. They selfishly think of themselves. If you have ever had to confront the other man or other woman, you may be able to relate to this difficult act. If you are in an affair or pondering an affair, would you want your spouse to make a similar call?\n\nLast and most importantly, God is a loving and forgiving God. He loves even the most vile and will forgive the most egregious sins. God offers forgiveness and a new beginning to all the accept Christ."}

Yet as with almost any tool, mind control techniques can be used for the good of all of us or used to gain personal benefit at the expense of others.\n\nThough this lesson may be the most disturbing of all for some, it is also vitally important as far as understanding how some of the top secret, sophisticated operations which have a major impact on our world have been carried out. This topic also has some amazing healing applications. These applications and the deeper implications of all this information will be discussed at the end of the lesson.\n\nFirst, you are invited to explore some highly reliable information on how mind control has been used to forward hidden, disempowering agendas in our world. Please watch the revealing, 45-minute History Channel documentary Mind Control: America's Secret War at the link below:\n\nhttps://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrolvideo\n\nSome people would rather not know the many potentially disturbing facts about secret mind control programs used to manipulate people and politics around the world. Yet when we collectively choose not to know, those who are abusing these technologies are given free rein to explore further and to cause serious manipulations which lead to even more fear and polarization in our world.\n\nBy choosing to at least understand the basics of what is going on, we can come together to stop the destructive behavior and invite others to join us in working together for what's best for all on our planet. For the best concise summary of secret mind control programs, please read the two-page essay below:\n\nhttps://www.WantToKnow.info/mindcontrol\n\nSacred Cows\n\nDon't ignore the bad stuff, but make a point of celebrating the beautiful stuff with all the exuberant devotion you can muster.\n\n~ Rob Brezsny in his fun, profound book Pronoia is the Antidote for Paranoia\n\n\nTo Complete Insight Course Lesson 14: Click Here"}
{"text": "There is no doubt that conservative presidential candidate Donald Trump always says what he believes. He is a strong defender of American values and embodies the principles of Ronald Reagan.\n\nNow, we're all seeing this recently unearthed 2011 interview Trump did with David Brody of the Christian Broadcast Network (CBN). He was asked to go into detail about his response to a question Bill O'Reilly on Fox News asked him about the Islam and Muslim problem in America.\n\nTrump didn't hold back, and explained to CBN there IS a serious problem with Muslims:\n\nAbsolutely, yes. In fact I went a step further. I said I didn't see Swedish people knocking down the World Trade Center. And by the way, many, many, most Muslims are wonderful people, but is there a Muslim problem? Look what's happening. Look what happened right here in my city with the World Trade Center and lots of other places.\n\nThen, he went after the politicians who are too afraid to confront evil directly, like a real leader should…\n\nI think people want the truth. I think they're tired of politicians. They're tired of politically correct stuff. I mean I could have said, 'Oh, absolutely not Bill, there's no Muslim problem, everything is wonderful, just forget about the World Trade Center.' But you have to speak the truth. We're so politically correct that this country is falling apart.\n\nHave you ever heard a politician speak in such a straight-forward, no-nonsense way? He cut right to the core of the matter, which is very personal for Trump as he is a New Yorker who lived there on 9/11.\n\nThen, Trump didn't stop there! He also explained his serious reservations about the teachings inside the Quran, the holy book of Islam:\n\nThe Quran is very interesting. A lot of people say it teaches love … But there's something there that teaches some very negative vibe … Now I don't know if that's from the Quran. I don't know if that's from someplace else. But there's tremendous hatred out there that I've never seen anything like it.\n\nWatch here:\n\nRead this Next on ThePoliticalInsider.com Democrats Demand Trump Immediately Withdraw Kavanaugh Nomination BEFORE Ford's Testimony\n\nDo you support Trump in 2016?

{"text": "\"The point is, you are alive when they start to eat you.\" —Dr. Alan Grant(src)\n\n\nDeinonychus was the first of the raptors (technically called \"Dromaeosaurs\") to be known from a nearly complete skeleton. Velociraptor had been discovered forty years earlier but was known only from a skull and a few bones of its hands and feet.[1]\n\nThe skeleton of Deinonychus were first to show the now infamous sickle-shaped retractable foot claw (8 inch), used for ripping open the skin of a victim, causing the preys guts be ripped and with a considerable amount of damage. Deinonychus also had a nasty bite, with over 60 knife-like teeth. Although with a deadly bite its arms and legs would be most powerful and could rear on one leg and kick an opponent.[1]\n\nDr. John Ostrom discovered Deinonychus in 1964. Dr. Ostrom believed that this dinosaur was an agile, swift predator, more like a warm-blooded mammal or bird than a cold-blooded crocodile.[1]\n\nWikipedia has a more detailed and comprehensive article on Deinonychus\n\n\nBehind the scenes\n\nDeinonychus was the basis for novel canon's Velociraptors and in turn the raptors seen in the films.\n\nJurassic Park novel author Michael Crichton visited John Ostrom—the discoverer of Deinonychus—when doing research for the novel. Ostrom said that Crichton's Velociraptor was based on Deinonychus in \"almost every detail\" and Crichton had even called him to inform him that he had renamed the Deinonychus in his novel to Velociraptor because he felt it sounded \"more dramatic\".[6]\n\nDuring the production of the Jurassic Park film, Steven Spielberg's production contacted John Ostrom and requested copies of all the technical papers that Ostrom had done of Deinonychus.[6] Unlike the novel, the raptors that were seen in the film were to be properly named Deinonychus and Mark \"Crash\" McCreery had even made concept art of this raptor in 1991,[7] but later in pre-production it was renamed to Velociraptor."}
{"text": "Screen shot (WSBTV)\n\nParents in Johns Creek, Georgia are upset about a middle school visual rhetoric assignment that asked students to identify and analyze features of a Reconstruction-era editorial cartoon depicting blacks in a situation that is \"worse than slavery,\" WSBTV reports.\n\nThe cartoon, drawn by lifelong abolitionist Thomas Nast and published in the October 24, 1874 issue of Harper's Weekly, depicts a member of the Ku Klux Klan and a member of the White League shaking hands over a cowering black family. In the background, a black man can be seen hanging from a tree. The image is intended to represent the position that even though institutionalized slavery no longer existed, there were still quasi-governmental structures — like the KKK and the White League — that prevented blacks from enjoying the freedom promised to them.\n\nSPONSORED\n\nParents at the Johns Creek school, however, see it differently.\n\n\"It looks like a Ku Klux Klan flyer of a lynching,\" Emzie Glass told WSBTV. Another parent, Jeff Royster, agreed, saying that \"I thought that was pretty over the top for an eighth-grader to have to handle.\"\n\nBoth Glass and Royster claim that this is merely the latest in a string of racially insensitive lesson plans devised by the school's eighth grader social studies teacher.\n\n\"He had made a comment that slavery should have not ended with a war, but should have ended with just sentiments in the South changing,\" Royster said. \"They're teaching the things that don't offend whites.\"\n\nFulton County schools spokeswoman Susan Hale told WSBTV that the district had been made aware of Glass and Royster's complaints, but that it had not been able to substantiate claims that there had been a pattern of racially insensitive lesson planning by this teacher.\n\nFulton County Schools released a statement in which it defended the teaching of the cartoon, but acknowledge that it could have been presented in a more culturally sensitive manner.\n\n\"The political cartoon was included in a packet of class materials about the Civil War and Reconstruction,\" the statement read. \"In retrospect, we regret that it was not shared with students in a more culturally sensitive way and that families were not given the proper context for the material. We are reviewing this situation so we can learn from it.\"\n\nWatch a report via WSBTV below."}
{"text": "Further Reading IDC: PC sales drop to levels not seen since 2007 While other market analysts are seeing overall PC sales continue to decline, a new report from Jon Peddie Research (JPR) shows the worldwide market for PC gaming hardware growing faster than expected in 2016.\n\nAll told, the market for pre-built and \"DIY\" gaming-focused PCs (which also includes \"upgrades and accessories such as input devices and audio/communication systems\") exceeded $30 billion (£24 billion) for the first time last year ($30.346 billion, to be precise), according to JPR's latest report. That's well up from the estimated $24.6 billion (£19.6 billion) market for gaming PCs that JPR saw back in 2015. Back then, JPR projected that the PC gaming market wouldn't pass the $30 billion mark until 2018, meaning the industry has accelerated roughly two years ahead of those old projections.\n\n\"The average PC sale is increasingly motivated by the video game use model, which is important to understand in a stagnant or declining overall PC market,\" JPR writes in explaining its findings. \"As basic computing functions become more entrenched with mobile devices, the PC ultimately becomes a power user's tool...\"\n\nWhile Europe and North America still spend the most on what JPR calls \"high-end\" PC gaming hardware, the Asia Pacific region is now the biggest and fastest-growing market for gaming PCs overall. The £9 billion that region spends on gaming PC hardware is up 9.61 percent annually, thanks to \"an entrenched PC gaming culture, large population, and a lack of significant console traction,\" according to JPR.\n\nOverall, JPR sees the gaming PC market shifting slightly away from the \"entry-level\" tier (22% of the market, down from 26% in 2015) and toward more powerful \"mid-range\" systems (35% of the market, up from 31%). The most powerful \"high-end\" PCs still make up a plurality 43% of the overall market.\n\nJPR hasn't yet released similar numbers for console hardware in 2016. In 2015, though, the market for what JPR calls \"TV gaming\" hardware was about 15 percent bigger than that for PC gaming hardware. That's a marked change from 2014, though, when JPR estimated that PC game hardware sold about twice as well as console gaming hardware."}

Calls to several listed numbers reached no one. Their lawyer says these are simply allegations. The company has not made any comment."}
{"text": "What a damned nerve! A wine bar and bistro in Nice has apparently grown so fed up of rude customers that it's started penalising impoliteness. Ask for \"a coffee\" in La Petite Syrah, and it costs you €7 (£5.90). Ask for \"a coffee please,\" and the price drops to €4.25 (£3.60). But enter the place crying \"Bonjour, a coffee please,\" - perhaps also embracing everyone within reach- and the cup will cost you what it costs generally in Nice: €1.40 (£1.20).\n\nAnd this from a French catering trade renowned the world over as a manners-free, arrogant zone where - according to recent allegations made against two Parisian restaurants - ugly customers are systematically hidden out of view.\n\nAccepting such etiquette lessons from French waiters could only be tolerable, we might conclude, if, by the same token, the coffee got cheaper still when our order was forgotten, reduced to nothing when the waiter scowled - and he then paid us when he poured it over our jackets.\n\nAnd yet, and yet - I think the rudeness of French catering in general, and waiters in particular, is vastly overdone. The rudest waiter I ever met was in a gastronomic restaurant in northern England (\"You wouldn't effing well smile if you worked here, pal,\" he confided.) I also think it's quite rude to be served unspeakable espresso in a polystyrene tumbler by a witless young person filling in time before applying to TV reality shows for a more promising future. But this happens every time I set foot in Britain.\n\nBecause, in short, we don't take waiting-on seriously, we fail to appreciate that the French do. They consider it a profession worthy of respect. You can tell that by their aprons, bow-ties - and age. These fellows can carry an order of 14 different drinks in their heads, deliver them all to your terrace table on one tray, shout at a passing taxi driver, give directions to the Eiffel Tower - and get your change right, pretty much simultaneously. They are busy men doing important work. So naturally they may be a little brusque when you change all 14 orders - in English. Imagine trying to order 14 different drinks in a London pub - in French."}

Two other sport centres in Tripoli were also restored as part of the \"Sports for Peace\" project.\n\nBaresi, who is regarded as one of football's greatest ever players and won the Champions League three times with AC Milan and the World Cup for Italy in 1982, said he was happy to support Sports for Peace. \"It was amazing to see the results achieved, such as the rehabilitation of safe play spaces like the Btekhnay Sport Centre and the training of 45 coaches,\" he said after opening the centre last week.\n\nSports for Peace was launched last March and aims to support Syrian refugee children and young people who are trying to overcome the traumatic consequences of their displacement. This will help them better interact and integrate with the local Lebanese community.\n\nMore than 1,400 children, Syrian and Lebanese, attended the opening ceremony. \"It was a really touching experience to see the children play, enjoy themselves and smile after so much pain.

See it here.\n\nIn a suit filed shortly after he was confirmed as Secretary of the Treasury, RKA claimed that Mnuchin and 11 others at Relativity, including CEO Ryan Kavanaugh, duped the consortium of lending the studio $81 million to help finance five films. RKA claimed that Mnuchin and the other defendants secretly knew that the cash would be used to prop up the struggling studio's operations before it filed for bankruptcy protection.\n\nThe state's Supreme Court, however, dismissed Mnuchin from the case in June, finding that RKA had failed to prove that Mnuchin \"was responsible for, aware of, or participated in the purported fraud,\" and that his \"personal friendship with Kavanaugh is insufficient to establish awareness of a liability.\"\n\nIn its notice of appeal, RKA argued that the high court erred as a matter of law by failing to consider the specific allegations pleaded in the second amended complaint that demonstrated Mnuchin's \"awareness of and participation in the fraud, including by virtue of his position as co-chairman of Relativity's board,\" that he was \"intimately involved in Relativity's financial decisions and transactions,\" and that his \"knowledge of and participation in the fraud can be inferred through Mnuchin's position as co-chairman of Relativity's board while the fraud was ongoing.\" See the notice of appeal here.\n\nRKA also argued that the court erred in dismissing Mnuchin from the lawsuit \"because if failed to accept the facts as alleged in the second amended complaint as true and determine only whether the facts as alleged fit within any cognizable legal theory.\" The news appeal was first reported in the Daily Mail.\n\nRKA further argued that court erred \"because it failed to accord plaintiff the benefit of every possible favorable inference drawn from the facts pled in the second amended complaint,\" and by concluding that that Mnuchin would have had to have made a misstatement to participate in the fraud."}

The result was increased production – vital for building muscles – and decreased breakdown of protein in the cells.\n\nResearcher Dr Slavo Komarnytsky, at North Carolina State University, said: 'We hope that one day brassinosteroids may provide an effective, natural, and safe alternative for age and disease-associated muscle loss, or be used to improve endurance and physical performance.'\n\n'Because some plants we eat contain these compounds, like mustards, in the future we may be able to breed or engineer these plants for higher brassinosteroid content, thus producing functional foods that can treat or prevent diseases and increase physical performance.'\n\nOld school: Cartoon character Popeye missed a trick on not including mustard in his strength-diet\n\nDr Gerald Weissmann, editor of the FASEB Journal, in which the study was published, added: ' The temptation is to see this discovery as another quick fix to help you go from fat to fit, and to a very small degree, this may be true.\n\n'This study identifies an important drug target for a wide range of conditions that cause muscle wasting.'\n\n\nDuring the research healthy rats then received an oral dose of homobrassinolide daily for 24 days and changes in body weight, food consumption and body consumption were measured.\n\n\nRats receiving the steroid gained more weight and slightly increased their food intake.\n\n\nBody composition was measured and showed increased lean body mass in the animals treated.\n\n\nThis study was repeated in rats fed high protein diets and similar results were seen."}
{"text": "For the first time, scientists have studied clouds and wind on the night side of Venus, and they've found that it's very different from the day side, IFL Science reports.\n\nThat data comes from the European Space Agency's Venus Express spacecraft, which entered orbit around Venus in April 2006 before being crashed into the planet in December 2014. Led by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the study was published in Nature.\n\nWe already knew that Venus has a weird super-rotation, where its winds can rotate 60 times faster than the planet. But it seems that on the night side, this process is even more chaotic than on the day side.\n\n\"This study challenges our current understanding of climate modelling and, specifically, the super-rotation, which is a key phenomenon seen at Venus,\" said Håkan Svedhem, ESA Project Scientist for Venus Express, in a statement.\n\nThe team found that night-side clouds form large, irregular patterns, dominated by waves that appear to stand still in the atmosphere, called stationary waves. In January of this year, a huge stationary wave was seen on Venus by the Akatsuki spacecraft, stretching for more than 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles).\n\nIn this study, the scientists used data from the Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) to study the night side, using infrared to study the clouds. They found they did not move with the atmosphere, an unexpected discovery that was later confirmed by Akatsuki.\n\nStationary waves are thought to form over mountains or other high-elevation regions. Weirdly though, in this data stationary waves were missing in the intermediate and lower cloud levels, up to about 50 kilometers (31 miles) above the surface.\n\n\"We expected to find these waves in the lower levels because we see them in the upper levels, and we thought that they rose up through the cloud from the surface,\" co-author Ricardo Hueso of the University of the Basque Country in Bilbao, Spain, in the statement. \"It's an unexpected result for sure, and we'll all need to revisit our models of Venus to explore its meaning.\"\n\nAkatsuki is continuing to orbit Venus, so it may be able to shed some light on some of the weird things going on with the planet.\n\nWN.com, Jim Berrie"}

{"text": "Black Sabbath bassist and self-proclaimed \"crazy cat person\" Geezer Butler wants people to stop declawing their cats. The musician has issued a statement via the Humane Society of the United States to urge the passing of a bill introduced by the New York State Senate that would make the state the first to ban the practice.\n\n\"New York is one of Black Sabbath's favorite states to perform in because New Yorkers are smart, open-minded, and compassionate,\" the bassist wrote. \"I am particularly delighted to be coming back to the Empire State after learning from my friends at the Humane Society of the United States that there is a bill before lawmakers that, if passed, would ban the practice of declawing cats.\n\n\"Many know me as one of the founding members of Black Sabbath, but fewer likely know that I am what you might call a 'crazy cat person,'\" he continued. \"My wife and I have rescued many cats and we have never dreamed of putting them through an elective, convenience surgery such as declawing.\n\n\"Can you imagine having your fingers chopped off at the last bone?\" he concluded. \"That is what the equivalent is for cats who are declawed. It is dreadfully inhumane! A surge of veterinarians throughout New York support legislation to put declawing in the trash bin of history. I urge lawmakers to remain steadfast in those characteristics I admire most about New Yorkers and support the bill to ban the declawing of cats.\"\n\nVeterinarians opposing the bill claim they earn between $100 and $500 for each procedure, according to New York Post. Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal told the paper in November that she hoped to educate lawmakers on the practice. If passed, the bill would join recently enacted animal-friendly laws including allowing dogs in outdoor cafes and a ban on tattooing and piercing pets.\n\nButler and his Black Sabbath bandmates will be playing New York City later this week as part of their final tour, dubbed \"The End.\" The bassist told Rolling Stone that he had mixed emotions about putting an end to the pioneering metal group, which he helped form in 1968. \"It'll be bittersweet,\" he said, looking ahead to the group's as-yet-unannounced final gig. \"I'm glad we're finishing on a high note, but sad that it's the end of what I've known for most of my life.\""}

Thanks to Pianos in the Parks, you'll find \"artistically enhanced\" uprights ready for the playing inside Cal Anderson and Volunteer Park:\n\nPianos in the Parks features 20 artistically enhanced pianos created by Gage Academy of Art faculty, students and friends, each placed in one of 15 iconic Seattle city parks and open spaces, such as Alki Park, Cal Anderson Park, and Seattle Center, and five King County Parks locations, including Marymoor Park and the Sammamish River Trail.\n\nThe project is designed to encourage \"Puget Sound residents to discover 32,000+ acres of City of Seattle and King County parks and open spaces through the power of music and art,\" a statement on the month-long effort reads.\n\nIt also comes as Seattle prepares to vote on a Seattle tax district to pay for the city's parks and community centers. The project is underwritten by Laird Norton Wealth Management, according to a statement on the campaign.\n\nWhile the painted pianos are intended to look nice, they're also — at least for now — in tune:\n\nEach piano, procured and tuned by Classic Pianos, is available for the public to play. Musicians of every level are encouraged to enter the Pianos in the Parks Facebook contest at: https://www.facebook.com/pianosintheparks, in which they can upload a video of their performance of an original piece or music from the public domain for a chance to play at Concerts at the Mural presented by KEXP and Seattle Center on Friday, August 22. Entries will be voted on by Facebook \"likes\" with the top five most heavily \"liked\" videos being judged by a community panel.\n\nCapitol Hill's Gage Academy lead the way in decorating the pianos. How Seattle Parks intends to keep people from, um, adding additional works of art to the pianos is not entirely clear. The pianos will offered for auction at the end of the project. Proceeds from the sales will benefit Seattle Parks and Recreation, King County Parks, Seattle Symphony, KEXP and Gage. You can learn more — and make a bid — at pianosintheparks.com."}
{"text": "DEAR ABBY: My husband and I raised our two sons and two daughters. One son and both daughters married well. Our other son, \"Neil,\" is gay. He and his partner, \"Ron,\" have been together 15 years, but Neil's father and I never wanted to know Ron because we disapproved of their lifestyle.\n\nWhen I was 74, my husband died, leaving me in ill health and nearly penniless. No longer able to live alone, I asked my married son and two daughters if I could \"visit\" each of them for four months a year. (I didn't want to burden any one family, and thought living out of a suitcase would be best for everyone.) All three turned me down. Feeling unwanted, I wanted to die.\n\nWhen Neil and Ron heard what had happened, they invited me to move across country and live with them. They welcomed me into their home, and even removed a wall between two rooms so I'd have a bedroom with a private bath and sitting room -- although we spend most of our time together.\n\nThey also include me in many of their plans. Since I moved in with them, I have traveled more than I have my whole life and seen places I only read about in books. They never mention the fact that they are supporting me, or that I ignored them in the past.\n\nWhen old friends ask how it feels living with my gay son, I tell them I hope they're lucky enough to have one who will take them in one day. Please continue urging your readers to accept their children as they are. My only regret is that I wasted 15 years. -- GRATEFUL MOM\n\nDEAR GRATEFUL MOM: You are indeed fortunate to have such a loving, generous and forgiving son. Sexual orientation is not a measure of anyone's humanity or worth. Thank you for pointing out how important it is that people respect each other for who they are, not for what we would like them to be.\n\nYou could have learned that lesson long ago, had you and your husband contacted Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) when you first learned that Neil was gay. Among other things, the organization offers support groups and education for parents who need to learn more about gender issues. (The address is 1726 M St. N.W., Suite 400, Washington, D.C. 20036.)"}

Hunt will also continue to play a lead role representing the club with FCD's corporate partners, the North Texas soccer community and FCD's supporters.\n\n\"Since being asked to lead the FC Dallas organization on an interim basis in November of 2012, I have considered it an absolute honor and privilege to work alongside a very talented group of co-workers,\" Dan Hunt said. \"Today, to be asked by my brother Clark and my family to take over as president of the club is a moment I will truly treasure for the rest of my life, and I look forward to building on the tremendous legacy of my late father, Lamar, here in North Texas. Across all facets of what we do here, we have the right foundation to build an MLS Champion both on and off the field. I would like to personally thank our fans, our partners including the city of Frisco, our players and our staff for all of their support and commitment to this club.\"\n\nAs president of FC Dallas, Dan Hunt joins Technical Director Fernando Clavijo and recently hired head coach Oscar Pareja as part of the leadership team that will report to Clark Hunt, who adds the club's CEO responsibilities to his role as chairman.\n\nClark Hunt, Dan Hunt, Pareja, and Clavijo will be available to the media at a news conference tomorrow to formally introduce Head Coach Oscar Pareja and 2014 First Round SuperDraft selection Tesho Akindele."}

{"text": "The Cleveland Browns, San Francisco 49ers and New York Giants all hit the road this week as big underdogs at the sportsbooks hoping to earn their first wins of the season.\n\nFor the Browns and 49ers, that fact is not surprising at all. But when it comes to the Giants, oddsmakers and bettors alike could not have imagined that they would be sitting at 0-5 heading into Week 6. The other New York team – the Jets – were supposed to be battling Cleveland and San Francisco for the top overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft.\n\nInstead, though, injuries have made it a real possibility that the Giants could end up going 0-16. In fact, of the three winless teams, only the Browns have lower odds of finishing that way at +800 (bet $100 to win $800). New York's number is currently at +950, while San Francisco's is +1200 at sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark.com.\n\nThe odds of any team going 0-16 for the second time ever is +300, while the price on that not happening is still a strong favorite at -400 (bet $400 to $100). The 2008 Detroit Lions remain the only team in league history to go winless with a 16-game schedule.\n\nCleveland went 1-15 in 2016 and picked up its lone victory in Week 16 at home against the San Diego Chargers. This year, the best bet for the Browns might be beating the Chargers again on the road in Week 13, especially since Los Angeles does not really have any real home-field advantage since relocating to the StubHub Center in Carson.\n\nThe 49ers will host the Giants in Week 10 before their bye and play in a weaker division (NFC West), so maybe that is why their odds are not as low as the other two winless teams. San Francisco managed to pick up two wins in 2016, sweeping the Los Angeles Rams, and they nearly defeated them a fourth straight time earlier this season.\n\nNew York plays in arguably the league's toughest division (NFC East) and has a very difficult schedule the rest of the way. The Giants host the Rams in Week 9 after their bye before visiting the 49ers and might go winless if they lose both of those games. Last year, they won nine of their last 11 games after a 2-3 start and made the playoffs."}
{"text": "Sen. Mike Crapo (R-ID) pulled his endorsement of Donald Trump in early October over the 2005 tape revealing the GOP nominee's vulgar comments about women, but just two weeks later the Republican senator now says he will vote for Trump after all.\n\n\"The choice we still have today and the choice we will have is between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton,\" Crapo told conservative radio host Neal Larson on Friday, according to the Idaho State Journal. \"In that context, I have to tell you, though I thought and felt we needed a different choice, that's not what we're going to get, and we cannot elect Hillary Clinton for many reasons. … Given that choice, I will vote for the Republican ticket: Trump and (vice presidential nominee Mike) Pence.\"\n\nCrapo said that he wants a president \"who will appoint strong Supreme Court justices, who will interpret the Constitution as it was written and who will help lead us to a stronger free market and a more limited government.\"\n\n\"In that context, I don't think the choice is that hard when we realize the decision this country must make,\" he said, according to the Idaho State Journal.\n\nThese comments come about two weeks after Crapo rescinded his endorsement of Trump and urged him to drop out of the race in the wake of a 2005 tape in which Trump brags about grabbing and kissing women without permission.\n\n\"I have reached a decision that I can no longer endorse Donald Trump. This is not a decision that I have reached lightly, but his pattern of behavior has left me no choice. His repeated actions and comments toward women have been disrespectful, profane and demeaning,\" Crapo said in a statement at the time. \"I have spent more than two decades working on domestic violence prevention. Trump's most recent excuse of 'locker room talk' is completely unacceptable and is inconsistent with protecting women from abusive, disparaging treatment.\"\n\nCrapo is not the first Republican lawmaker to say that he will vote for Trump after calling on the Republican nominee to drop out of the race.

It remains a possibility that some are buried within the area of the proposed development.\"\n\nIt also warns that \"ground disturbances ... will have an adverse and negative impact on archaeological deposits ...This includes possible burials relating to the former use of the site as a Magdalene Laundry.\"\n\nThe report recommends that \"the proposed development area is subject to a detailed archaeological test trenching assessment\" following demolition.\n\nRTÉ's Prime Time broadcast footage taken from inside the old laundry\n\nThe Religious Sisters of Charity said in a statement that they have a private cemetery in the convent grounds in Donnybrook where both sisters and residents are buried.\n\nThey say they can account for the whereabouts of all those who died while working and living in Donnybrook and that the death and burial records were checked by the McAleese Commission.\n\nMagdalene women were buried in unmarked graves in the past at High Park laundry in north Dublin.\n\nIn 1993, the Sisters of Our Lady of Charity - a different order to the Donnybrook sisters - sold convent land for development and applied to have the remains of 133 Magdalene women exhumed from their graveyard.\n\nBut 155 remains were found - which meant 22 bodies had not been accounted for.\n\nThe bodies were eventually cremated and re-interred in Magdalene plots at Glasnevin Cemetery.\n\nThe Sisters of Our Lady of Charity explained this as an administrative error within their archive and said the documentation was subsequently put in order.\n\nHowever the Justice for Magdalenes group says that even today there are over 100 High Park Magdalene women buried in unmarked or wrongly marked graves in Glasnevin."}

(KORAIL), were brought down by an average of around 20 percent, KORAIL said.\n\nMore than 6,500 unionized KORAIL workers continued their strike for the 10th day in protest against a government decision to set up a new rail operator that they claim is the first step toward privatization of the rail operator.\n\nDaily bullet-train KTX services were reduced by 12 percent, and the operation of the normal-speed Mugunghwa trains were also somewhat affected, it added.\n\nKORAIL workers have criticized the planned establishment of the affiliate, claiming that it is the first step toward privatizing the state-run company, which they say could result in massive layoffs and fare hikes.\n\nThe company has denied the claim, saying the new unit will be 41 percent and 59 percent owned by KORAIL and state-run investors, respectively, and that private firms will never be allowed to buy stakes in it.\n\nThe new service will run from Suseo-dong in southern Seoul to the southern port city of Busan. After several delays, it is expected to begin operations in 2016.\n\nkhj@yna.co.kr\n\n(END)"}
{"text": "China's massive property bubble creates mad scramble to take on decades of debt\n\nMassive infusions of cash by way of the central bank, combined with runaway mass panic-buying has stampeded Chinese people into buying into the property markets in boomtowns like Shenzhen, despite the insane prices that almost guarantee that they will default on their mortgages -- because they fear that rising property prices will shut them out forever if they don't buy now, and the new rentiers who've speculated on all that property are cranking up rents so fast that renting is worse than buying.\n\nIt's an eerie echo of the runup to the subprime collapse of 2007/8, a blend of toxic debt and panic-buying fueled by the fear of literally not having a roof over your head and the belief that property markets can only ever go up because no one remembers the last time they cratered.\n\n\nIn May last year, after the value of his first flat, a 70 square metre unit in Guangzhou's Panyu subdistrict, soared from 900,000 yuan (US$136,500) to 1.2 million yuan in just a few months, Mai, who has a monthly salary of 15,000 yuan, decided to raise the down payment for a new property to cash in on the booming housing market. In June, he emptied his and his parents' 300,000 yuan in savings and incurred debts to friends to muster the 50 per cent down payment for a 2.4 million yuan flat. To meet the mortgage repayments of about 12,000 yuan a month on the two flats, and other debts to friends, he used the first flat as collateral for a loan about 800,000 yuan and got 200,000 yuan in cash from a short-term consumer loans supposedly for a car. Mai got the money easily from local banks and financial institutions. Now, he needs to pay about 25,000 yuan a month for loans totalling around 3 million yuan, including around 4,000 yuan in mortgage payments for his first flat, about 7,300 yuan in mortgage payments for his second flat, nearly 9,000 yuan on the secondary mortgage for his first flat, 3,800 yuan for car loans, and the rest to service debts to family members and friends.\n\n\nChina's mortgage debt bubble raises spectre of 2007 US crisis\n\n[He Huifeng/South China Morning Post]\n\n(via Naked Capitalism)"}
{"text": "La Sirena Cigars is fully owned and operated by Arielle Ditkowich as of January 1, 2014. Below is the full brand history:\n\nThe La Sirena Story began in 2006 in New York City when Nestor Miranda met Arielle Ditkowich at an event. He was immediately taken by her love of tobacco, desire to learn more and the way she connected with people. Over the course of time he took her under his wing and they both learned from each other about the changing cigar market as well as the cigars that people demanded.\n\nIn early 2008, the two decided to produce a cigar that would fit the profile of what today's cigar aficionado wanted. At a roundtable discussion names were being discussed, when Arielle asked, \"What is the spanish word for Mermaid\". The answer was, \"La Sirena\".\n\nWith the name in place and a desire to create a full bodied cigar, the team set off for Esteli, Nicaragua where they began working with the Garcia family at My Father Cigars. Over the course of the next few months countless blends were smoked and finally the blend that fit the profile that La Sirena was seeking was found.\n\nLater that year, at the IPCPR in New Orleans, the cigar made it's debut as a gift to those who visited the Miami Cigar & Co. booth. The feedback received from members of the media as well as retailers was outstanding and it was now time to set sail full steam ahead.\n\nIn 2009, La Sirena was officially released and today it continues to be requested at many tobacconists nationwide. The brand followed up with its second release in 2012, Merlion, created by La Aurora in the Dominican Republic with the medium bodied, full flavored smoker in mind.\n\nAfter a successful 3-year partnership, Ditkowich was ready to spread her La Sirena wings and became an independent company. Ditkowich purchased the distribution rights from Miami Cigar & Co. and continues to manage the brand. La Sirena brand cigars are distributed nationwide and available at over 300 retail stores. International distribution is growing quickly as we continue to push through 2014.\n\nLa Sirena Cigars main office is located in NY and warehouse in Doral, Florida.\n\nSo come on board, and discover La Sirena!"}

{"text": "While Spotify may lead in terms of subscribers, it's already been proven that Apple Music can dominate even with its smaller user base. A new report from analytics firm Verto further highlights the sometimes underestimated reach of Apple Music.\n\nThe report shows that Apple Music comes out on top in terms of monthly unique users, thanks in large part to the three-month free trial Apple offers.\n\nSylvania HomeKit Light Strip\n\nThe data from Verto says that Apple Music attracted 40.7 million unique users during the month of February in the US, putting it well ahead of Pandora at 32.6 million unique users. Spotify rounded out the top three, coming in with 30.4 million unique users. Coming in fourth is iHeartRadio, while the struggling SoundCloud places fifth. These numbers include mobile users only, meaning they are likely higher if you take into account desktop.\n\nVetro explained to TechCrunch that how Apple Music was able to bring in so many unique monthly users centers around the three-month free trial that Apple offers. The analytics firm says that the free trial more than doubles the amount of people who use Apple Music in the United States.\n\nThis is an interesting tidbit of data for a number of reasons. For one, it really exemplifies just how big of a benefit Apple Music has by coming pre-installed on all iOS devices. Furthermore, it represents the potential for growth that Apple's streaming music service still has.\n\nMost recently, Apple stated that Apple Music has \"well past\" 20 million paying subscribers worldwide. Today's data from Verto claims that, in the US alone, Apple Music saw over 40 million unique users, presumably the majority of whom were free trial customers. Spotify, on the other hand, recently touted that it has 50 million paying subscribers worldwide, while it also has over 100 million users on its paid + free tiers combined. Nevertheless, Apple Music still outperformed Spotify in terms of active users in the United States.\n\nWhat this means for artists specifically is that if they're looking for the best platform to go to with exclusive content, or content in general, Apple Music has the broadest reach. This is especially notable considering Apple pays artists during that three-month free trial.\n\nA lot has been made about the success of Apple Music and Beats 1, but information like this highlights how Apple's large user base gives it an automatic leg-up compared to its competitors."}

{"text": "By Kathy Finn\n\nNEW ORLEANS (Reuters) – A U.S. police SWAT team stormed a rural Louisiana bank early on Wednesday, killing a gunman after he shot two hostages, one of whom later died.\n\nSPONSORED\n\nIn a dramatic end to a 12-hour standoff, State Police spokesman Albert Paxton said officers entered the bank in the small town of St. Joseph shortly after midnight because the gunman was threatening to kill one or both of his hostages.\n\nThe man, identified as 20-year-old Fuaed Abdo Ahmed, shot both hostages when police entered the building. Police then shot and killed him, Paxton said.\n\n\"He was angry and he wanted to kill hostages,\" Paxton said of the gunman, who initially took three bank employees hostage but released one woman after several hours.\n\nThe two wounded hostages were rushed to local hospitals but one of them later died, said State Police Sergeant Eric Cuenca. The other was in critical condition. The names of the hostages were not immediately released.\n\nAhmed was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and had complained of hearing voices, police said. The gunman's family owned a convenience store in the town.\n\nAhmed was the California-born son of Yemeni parents. Police said there was no indication of any link to recent threats of attacks on the United States originating from Yemen.\n\n\"We don't have any reason to believe there was any connection,\" Paxton said.\n\nThe United States earlier this month temporarily shut about 20 of its embassies and consulates in the Middle East and Africa, including its embassy in Yemen, and U.S. nationals were told to leave that country after U.S. officials said they picked up information about unspecified terrorist threats.\n\nThe Louisiana standoff took place at the Tensas State Bank in St. Joseph, a town of less than 1,200 people in the northeast of the state.\n\nAhmed had intended to take hostages from the beginning, police said. They found a book on hostage negotiations at his apartment.\n\n\"This was not a bank robbery,\" State Police Colonel Mike Edmonson told reporters in a video posted on the website of the Monroe, Louisiana News Star newspaper. \"He actually had a book for negotiations… and knew exactly how the negotiations would take place, the questions he would be asked.\"\n\n(Editing by Greg McCune and Mark Trevelyan)"}
{"text": "Disordered eating and dieting\n\nDisordered eating refers to a wide range of abnormal eating behaviours, many of which are shared with diagnosed eating disorders. The main thing differentiating disordered eating from an eating disorder is the level of severity and frequency of behaviours.\n\nRead more: Warning Signs and Symptoms of Eating Disorders\n\nDisordered eating can have a negative impact on a person's emotional, social and physical wellbeing. It may lead to fatigue, malnutrition or poor concentration. It can affect someone's social life (when socialising is restricted due to anxiety around food/eating), and can lead to anxiety and depression.\n\nDisordered eating behaviours and attitudes include:\n\nBinge eating\n\nDieting\n\nSkipping meals regularly\n\nSelf-induced vomiting\n\nObsessive calorie counting\n\nSelf-worth based on body shape and weight\n\nMisusing laxatives or diurectics\n\nFasting or chronic restrained eating (read more on fasting for cultural or religious reasons)\n\n\nWhat is considered \"normal\" in terms of quantities and types of food consumed varies considerably from person to person. \"Normal eating\" refers to the attitude a person holds in their relationship with food, rather than the type or amount of food they eat.\n\nIt is normal to:\n\nEat more on some days, less on others\n\nEat some foods just because they taste good\n\nHave a positive attitude towards food\n\nNot label foods with judgement words such as \"good\", \"bad\", \"clean\"\n\nOver-eat occasionally\n\nUnder-eat occasionally\n\nCrave certain foods at times\n\nTreat food and eating as one small part of a balanced life\n\nMindful eating\n\nMindful eating is a simple-to-learn life skill which can lead people to enjoy a satisfying, healthy and enjoyable relationship with food. It is a skill that can help people break free from 'food rules' and begin to enjoy healthy, flexible and relaxed eating practices. Mindful eating is not a diet. Mindful eating is about the way we eat, not what we eat. To learn more, download the Mindful Eating fact sheet.\n\nDid you know? Dieting is the single most important risk factor for developing an eating disorder. Girls who diet moderately are 5 times more likely to develop an eating disorder than those who don't diet, and those who diet severely are 18 times more likely."}
{"text": "Industry treasure & Drake's Head Brewer John Gillooly has a lot of opinions. He will also share them at will (trust us). So, we've decided to share his opinions with you nice blog readers. And with CraftBeer.com's post about the romance behind malt, we thought his thoughts on malts from the May 2014 newsletter would make a perfect companion:\n\nWhen I talk to other brewers, we often get quickly to hops – \"Have you tried EXP 01210? What do you think of Azzaca? How are your Simcoes this year?\"\n\nWe will talk about the nuances of early harvest vs. late harvest, ask about the newest hops coming out of Germany (Mandarina? Polaris?), and New Zealand (Waimea? Rakau?). We talk about dry-hopping techniques (do you drop the yeast first? at what temperature?), and the evolving technology of hop extraction. But we never get that deep with malt.\n\nIf you ask a brewer what's in their silo, you're most likely to get a brand name – Great Western or Rahr, most likely, or maybe something \"fancy\" like a German Pilsner malt, or British Pale ale. But ask them if they know the variety of malt, well, maybe the British malt guys know (Maris Otter, Golden Promise, etc..), but otherwise, we aren't paying attention to that.\n\nThe majority of malt Americans buy is domestic malt that is blended to meet certain technical criteria. The varieties can change. Currently, my silo contains a blend of Meredith, Copeland and Metcalfe. I know little about any of those varieties. If we were British brewers we would be talking about malt every bit as much we do hops – is Golden Promise \"sweeter\" than Maris Otter? Do you like Halcyon? But here? Can you imagine if brewers just bought hops on their specs? What do your choices become – American hops- citric, American hops- pine, British hops- earthy, Pilsner hops? Crazy.\n\nIt is a real curiosity to me that this is how those two markets evolved, and I am frankly surprised that we as brewers accept it. And where are the suppliers trying to sell me an \"heirloom\" malt variety? Why is no one planting Maris Otter in America?\n\n:dismounts soapbox:"}

It was based on a public threat from bin Laden against \"military passenger aircraft.\" The memo, however, said that bin Laden did \"not differentiate between those dressed in military uniforms and civilians,\" NBC News' Robert Windrem reported.\n\nThe Sept. 11 Commission, a panel appointed by Congress in 2002 to investigate U.S. security, made no mention of the memo in any of its reports, Windrem said. It is unknown why the report did not address the warning.\n\nThe document was first disclosed by Washington Post editor Bob Woodward, in his behind-the-scenes book, \"Bush at War,\" written in 2004. It was made public on Friday by the National Security Archive, a private group that uses Freedom of Information requests to obtain classified data.\n\nOn Friday, the National Security Archive also released a letter from former CIA Director George Tenet written five days after Sept. 11. Titled \"We're at War,\" the letter to top deputies urges an \"unrelenting focus\" on using all of America's capabilities, \"not only to protect the U.S. both here and abroad from additional terrorist attacks — but also, and more importantly, to neutralize and destroy al-Qaida and its partners.\"\n\nThe Sept. 16 letter was written in the wake of criticism directed at Tenet and the CIA for the agency's shortcomings in preventing an assault on U.S. soil.\n\nThere have been a slew of reports over the past decade of plots to use planes to strike American targets. In 1995, U.S. and Filipino authorities uncovered a plot by Ramsey Yusef, nephew of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind behind Sept. 11. Yusef threatened to hide bombs on planes and blow them up over the Pacific.\n\nThe most notable security warning, Windrem said, was a presidential briefing on an Aug. 6, 2000, that mentioned the possibility of passenger airliners being used in terrorist attacks."}

Created by Apocalypse's Horseman Sinister from genetic material taken from the mutant heroes Cyclops and Jean Grey of his reality, Nate ultimately learned that his purpose was to destroy Apocalypse. After the death of his surrogate father Forge, Nate traveled to Apocalypse's Citadel and battled Holocaust, another of Apocalypse's Horsemen. In an attempt to breach Holocaust's armor, Nate stabbed him with a shard of the M'Krann Crystal, causing them both to be transported to the Earth-616, the mainstream reality.\n\nNate's subconscious need for companionship created a physical body for the Red Queen of Earth-998, posing as the dissipated essence of Madelyne Pryor, the deceased clone of Jean Grey. Nate and Madelyne became fast friends, journeying through Europe until Pryor left to join the newly reformed Hellfire Club. Nate subsequently encountered the evil Dark Beast, a fellow refugee from his own time, who informed Nate that his vast powers were burning out his young body and that he would die before he turned 21.\n\nAfter this revelation, Professor Charles Xavier, the telepathic founder of the X-Men, probed Nate's mind. Sensing the evil in Xavier that would eventually become the powerful psionic entity Onslaught, Nate lashed out with his powers and pulled Xavier's psyche from the astral plane. This incident allowed Onslaught to escape Xavier's mind, and it captured Nate, Xavier, and Franklin Richards, the mutant son of Reed and Sue Richards of the world-famous Fantastic Four. Onslaught intended to use Nate's power to fuel his plans to turn the human race into a collective consciousness, but was defeated by the combined might of America's costumed champions.\n\nEventually, Nate realized the full extent of his powers and became a modern-day mutant shaman. To save humanity from destruction by an alien Harvester, Nate sacrificed himself to merge his energies with the alien's and, through the conduit it had forged with the world, into every being on the planet, thus rendering the world's energy useless to the Harvester's race.\n\nDuring his time spent in the mainstream reality, Nate had formed friendships with other heroes such as Spider-Man as well as opposing some of the worst villains known to man like the evil Abomination and the Purple Man. Grey also unwittingly unleashed a madman on the world called Jackknife."}

And while there are good jobs for software engineers and others in STEM, there are also good jobs in other fields.\n\nIn fact, not only are there good jobs, there are good jobs that companies can't fill fast enough with people — for everything from accountants to lawyers to nurses to travel agents, everywhere from Austin to Salt Lake City to Seattle and Washington, D.C.\n\nFor the past two years, we've been indexing millions of jobs every month across thousands of job boards. Using this data, not only can we tell you where the in-demand, high-paying jobs are, but we can also tell you exactly which of those jobs companies can't fill fast enough:\n\nFor example, since inauguration, it turns out that there's been a huge surge in demand for lawyers and paralegals in Washington, D.C.

I want council to reject this recommendation,\" accessibility advocate Adam Cohoon said at a news conference Monday.\n\nHe said the proposal would also lead to animosity between cyclists and accessible users.\n\n\"This proposal will just activate more conflict,\" Cohoon said \"The route to less conflict among road users like myself is to not allow parking in bike lanes.\"\n\nBurns Wattie, who drives a wheelchair van to accommodate his son who has a disability, also spoke out against the proposal.\n\n\"My presence in the bicycle lane creates an extremely dangerous situation of forcing cyclists into the travel lane of the road on a road where drivers no longer expect to see and encounter cyclists,\" he said.\n\nThe issue arose as part of a review that was requested last year by Coun. Kristyn Wong-Tam. She asked that staff take a look at the Sherbourne Street and Wellesley Street cycle tracks in terms of accessibility, parking and other concerns.\n\nReporting back on the issue Nov. 3, city staff recommended fixing some of the issues around accessible drop-offs by allowing an exemption for vehicles with accessible parking permits to pick up and drop off passengers in bike lanes.\n\nThe report goes to city council tomorrow and could have implications for how planners approach road space in other parts of the city as Toronto moves to establish a set of bikeway design guidelines, due sometime next year.\n\nHowever accessibility advocates say that they weren't consulted about the proposal and they don't think it's a good idea.\n\n\"There are options that the city could conceivably have chosen that they didn't even look at,\" Maureen Coyle of Walk Toronto told CP24 in an interview. \"Our main problem with this particular recommendation before council this week is that they didn't consult with the community, with the accessibility advocates, with the cycling advocates or the pedestrian advocates.\"\n\nShe said that while the solutions may not be simple, they must be developed \"in a way that is respectful of all users of the road.\"\n\nWong-Tam's office told CP24 Monday that she will ask city staff to examine other options for integrating accessibility solutions with the road design."}

{"text": "By Keith Idec\n\nThe Nevada State Athletic Commission voted unanimously during a Monday morning meeting to change the result of the Guillermo Rigondeaux-Moises Flores fight to a no-contest.\n\nRigondeaux originally was declared a winner by first-round knockout June 17 at Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas. The NSAC changed the result to a no-contest because video and audio evidence proved Rigondeaux's fight-ending left hand clearly landed after the bell sounded to end the first round.\n\nThe NSAC also agreed with referee Vic Drakulich's assessment in his post-fight report that Rigondeaux's late punch was unintentional. That's why the result was not changed to a disqualification victory for Flores, who said he couldn't continue after Rigondeaux's punch landed.\n\nMiami's Rigondeaux (17-0, 11 KOs, 1 NC), a two-time Olympic gold medalist for Cuba, will retain the WBA super bantamweight title. Mexico's Flores, who entered the fight as the WBA's interim champion at 122 pounds and was the mandatory challenger for Rigondeaux's title, will remain undefeated (25-0, 17 KOs, 2 NC).\n\nThe WBA likely will order a rematch.\n\nThe contents of Drakulich's report were not made available during the NSAC's meeting.\n\nAccording to Bob Bennett, the executive director of the NSAC, the result wasn't changed following an immediate replay review because an unidentified truck technician informed him that Rigondeaux's punch landed before the bell. Flores also appeared to throw a right hand after the bell sounded, but before Rigondeaux's left hand.\n\nDrakulich was more concerned immediately after the fight ended about Rigondeaux holding Flores behind his head and punching Flores prior to throwing that late left hand. Drakulich, who said he didn't hear the bell, did not have a full complement of video and audio available to him when he reviewed video at ringside following the fight.\n\nThe Rigondeaux-Flores fight was part of the HBO Pay-Per-View undercard prior to Andre Ward's eighth-round technical knockout victory over Sergey Kovalev in their light heavyweight championship rematch.\n\nKeith Idec is a senior writer/columnist for BoxingScene.com.

{"text": "Abstract\n\nCONTEXT: Previous epidemiological, animal, and human cognitive neuroscience research suggests that maternal smoking during pregnancy (SDP) causes increased risk of substance use/problems in offspring.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To determine the extent to which the association between SDP and offspring substance use/problems depends on confounded familial background factors by using a quasi-experimental design.\n\nDESIGN: We used 2 separate samples from the United States and Sweden. The analyses prospectively predicted multiple indices of substance use and problems while controlling for statistical covariates and comparing differentially exposed siblings to minimize confounding.\n\nSETTING: Offspring of a representative sample of women in the United States (sample 1) and the total Swedish population born during the period from January 1, 1983, to December 31, 1995 (sample 2).\n\nPATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Adolescent offspring of the women in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (n = 6904) and all offspring born in Sweden during the 13-year period (n = 1,187,360).\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported adolescent alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use and early onset (before 14 years of age) of each substance (sample 1) and substance-related convictions and hospitalizations for an alcohol- or other drug-related problem (sample 2).\n\nRESULTS: The same pattern emerged for each index of substance use/problems across the 2 samples. At the population level, maternal SDP predicted every measure of offspring substance use/problems in both samples, ranging from adolescent alcohol use (hazard ratio [HR](moderate), 1.32 [95% CI, 1.22-1.43]; HR(high), 1.33 [1.17-1.53]) to a narcotics-related conviction (HR(moderate), 2.23 [2.14-2.31]; HR(high), 2.97 [2.86-3.09]). When comparing differentially exposed siblings to minimize genetic and environmental confounds, however, the association between SDP and each measure of substance use/problems was minimal and not statistically significant.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The association between maternal SDP and offspring substance use/problems is likely due to familial background factors, not a causal influence, because siblings have similar rates of substance use and problems regardless of their specific exposure to SDP."}
{"text": "Back in the mid 1980s, GE and NASA began testing on a new propulsion system that used counter rotating fan assemblies in an attempt to boost efficiency. The testing ultimately led to the design of the GE36 experimental aircraft engine, but was then set aside to explore other options. Now, GE and NASA are planning on revisiting the design and adding some new technology to the mix.\n\nThe design is ultimately a hybrid between a Turbofan and Turboprop, which was aptly named a Propfan or Unducted Fan. The process begins by using a turbofan engine with the fans relocated to the outside of the engine housing. As the exhaust from the turbofan engine is forced out, they pass over a turbine which is connected to a prop on the exterior, while the other prop is driven by the turbofan.\n\nBoth sets of props have variable pitch blades that featured a dramatic curve, similar to a scimitar, which would allow the engine to reach speeds close to Mach .75. Along with the high flight speeds, the engine also showed a 30% to 35% decrease in fuel consumption. The only real drawback to using a Propfan engine was the noise that was present inside the cabin. This, when combined with a shifting market, ultimately led to the design being shelved.\n\nSkip to today's market, where the price of fuel is driving everyone in the transportation business to find ways to increase efficiency and decrease consumption, and the Propfan engine could change the air transportation industry as we know it.\n\nGE and NASA are planning on performing tests throughout the summer and into next year, using the same rig they had employed for testing on the GE36. They hope the advances in wind tunnel diagnostics and aerodynamic modeling will be able to offer a better picture of the feasibility of the experimental engine.\n\nThe testing itself will be conducted at the Glenn Research Center in Ohio and will focus more on the blade design rather than the engine itself. They plan on testing 6 different styles of blades, each with different lengths and sweeps, and determine which is able to provide the best performance for its intended application.\n\nAssuming the tests are successful, it might not be very long until we start to see open rotor engines on commercial aircraft. Aside from decreasing costs for the airline, a 30% reduction in fuel usage would have a huge impact on the prices of airline tickets as well as the amount of emissions being released into our atmosphere."}
{"text": "In reaction to the terrorist murders in Paris on Friday, Republican presidential hopefuls including Rand Paul (say it ain't so, Rand) are demanding that no refugees be admitted to the United States. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex) claimed that letting in Syrian refugees would be a \"roll of the dice.\" Reality TV billionaire blowhard Donald Trump declared that the refugees could be \"one of the great Trojan horses.\" Politico reports that at least ten Republican governors are vowing to keep out of their states any of the 10,000 or so Syrian refugees that could be admitted to the U.S. next year. Just how the governors think they have the authority to prevent people who are legally in this country from going where they want is not at all clear.\n\nSo what does history say about the dangers posed by refugees? Over at the Niskanen Center, David Bier who heads up the immigration policy department provides Six Reasons to Welcome Syrian Refugees After Paris. Number 2 is most relevant to the fearmongering Republicans pols:\n\n2. U.S. refugees don't become terrorists: The history of the U.S. refugee program demonstrates that the lengthy and extensive vetting that all refugees must undergo is an effective deterrent for terrorists. Since 1980, the U.S. has invited in millions of refugees, including hundreds of thousands from the Middle East. Not one has committed an act of terrorism in the U.S. Traditional law enforcement and security screening processes have a proven record of handling the threat from terrorist posing as refugees.\n\nDemagoguery is the practice of a politician to gain power and popularity by arousing the emotions, passions, and prejudices of the people. For shame!\n\nNote: Several commenters suggested Tamerlan and Dzhokar Tsarnaev, who committed the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, were refugees. Strictly speaking, they were the children of asylees. As Bloomberg News explained the two were given \"derivative asylum status\" and didn't come through the refugee admissions program. Apparently the legal distinction is too fine a point for some readers. So be it, but they should nevertheless keep in mind that the brothers were two people out around 1.8 million people who were granted refugee or asylee status between 1995 and 2013.\n\nUpdate: Readers might want to see the data on refugees and terrorism in my new article, \"Refugees and the Risk of 'Sleeper' Terrorists.\""}

The two brothers have also been charged with attempted first-degree murder and first-degree assault.\n\n\"The environment was incredibly chaotic,\" Stawinski said.\n\nDuring the bail hearing, Malik Ford collapsed.\n\n\"The family of Jacai Colson has been a paragon of strength,\" Chief Stawinski said. \"The mother and father standing with us during the press conference where we had to reveal this was likely a friendly fire incident, and even today as we have talked to them as this has unfolded, their support of this police department has been stunning.\"\n\nFlags at half staff to honor fallen Prince George's officer\n\nRELATED: Fallen Prince George's Co. officer killed by friendly fire\n\nSeveral family members testified on behalf of Malik and Elijah Ford during the bond hearing.

{"text": "You may be familiar with the idea of pre-cooling from the Olympics, having seen athletes wear ice vests for the first time during the 1996 Atlanta games. A cold shower works in a similar way.\n\nMultiple studies indicate that a cold shower, bath or even ice pack applied to strategic places (such as the back of your neck) before a workout may help not only cool your skin, but also reduce your core body temperature. Why would you want to do either of those things, when the idea behind a warm-up is just that -- to warm up? Cooling your muscles before a workout reduces their power, but if you're exercising in hot, humid temperatures, pre-cooling may be beneficial. A study published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology found that when muscles are cold, in this instance after being submerged in 53 degree F (12 degree C) water, the men in the experiment initially had a lower heart rate while exercising when compared to those whose muscles hadn't been treated to the cold-water bath.\n\nSubmerging yourself in a tub of cool water before intense exercise in hot summer temperatures can help reduce the risk of your body's core temperature rising too quickly. The idea behind pre-cooling is to reduce stress on the body while maximizing its endurance. In fact, researchers at the Australian Institute of Sport have found that reducing your core body temperature can help to increase your exercise performance by as much as 7 percent [source: Brearley]. A lower core temperature changes how the body deals with its heat storage reserves in hot weather, allowing for a greater possible increase in muscle temperature and heart rate before the body begins to overheat or become impaired. If you monitor your performance while you exercise, such as with a heart-rate monitor, this means you have just given yourself more time to work out before your core temperature hits critical levels.\n\nTemperature variations of just about 1 degree C (1.8 degrees F) impact muscle function. When you increase your body's temperature, you increase your workout power, but when you cool your muscles and resting body temperature, it can result in a cooled performance [source: Racinais and Oksa].\n\nRemember, a pre-cooling shower isn't for everyone. Unless you're an endurance addict, it may be best to reserve the cold showers for your cool-downs. To learn more, check out the next page.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSources"}

{"text": "Canada's police chiefs have voted overwhelmingly in favour of reforming drug laws in the country.\n\nThe Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, meeting in Winnipeg this week, wants officers to have the ability to ticket people found with 30 grams of marijuana or less.\n\nKentville, N.S., police Chief Mark Mander, chair of the association's drug-abuse committee, said Tuesday officers currently have only two choices: turn a blind eye or lay down the law.\n\nMander said officers could \"either to caution the offender or lay formal charges resulting in [a] lengthy, difficult process, which results in a criminal charge if proven, a criminal conviction, and a criminal record.\"\n\nMander said ticketing the offender would be far less onerous and expensive.\n\nHowever, federal Justice Minister Peter MacKay said there are no plans in the works to legalize or decriminalize marijuana. Though McKay had no follow up on the chiefs' recommendation, he said he appreciates their input.\n\n\"We don't support legalization or decriminalization,\" Mander said.\n\n\"Clearly there are circumstances where a formal charge for simple possession is appropriate. However, the large majority of simple possession cases would be more effectively, efficiently dealt with [by issuing a ticket],\" he added, noting the move would free up court time.\n\nThe president of the association and Vancouver police Chief Jim Chu said the plan offers a good compromise.\n\n\"It's a middle ground there, right? Nothing is nothing. All is a criminal record,\" Chu said.\n\nBill Vandegraaf, an advocate for marijuana use, said the ticket system amounts to decriminalization.\n\n\"They are diminishing the seriousness of the offence,\" said the former Winnipeg police officer, a member of the group Law Enforcement Against Prohibition who is currently licensed to grow and use marijuana for medical purposes.\n\n\"They are turning it into a common offence where they issue tickets on the street.\"\n\nVandergraaf called the proposal a good first step, but said it doesn't go far enough. \"If it's going to be a common offence notice, they might as well end prohibition altogether,\" he said.\n\nMany American states have moved to decriminalize or legalize marijuana, but federal laws remain unchanged.\n\nIn Seattle last week, police officers handed out bags of Doritos chips with copies of the state's new pot laws at an annual marijuana festival.

{"text": "A Zimbabwean family has been marooned at Bangkok's main airport for two months, Thai immigration police said Thursday, an ordeal over the holiday season that has drawn widespread sympathy among Thais.\n\nThe family, four adults and four children — who are aged between two and 11-years-old — have tried to leave Thailand since late October.\n\nBut they lack visas for onward travel, refuse to return to Zimbabwe and are denied re-entry to the kingdom after overstaying, trapping them in limbo in the airside area of the airport.\n\nTheir predicament first emerged after a Thai Facebook user posted a photo of himself giving one of the children a Christmas present.\n\nThe post, which explained their predicament, went viral as questions emerged as to how they had lived at the airport for so long.\n\nComparisons were quickly made with the 2004 film \"The Terminal,\" in which a man played by Tom Hanks finds himself stuck in a New York airport after his government collapses, rendering his papers useless.\n\nImmigration police said the family entered Thailand in May on tourist visas.\n\nOn October 23 they tried to fly to Spain via Ukraine, but were denied by the airline as they lacked Spanish visas.\n\nAs they had overstayed their Thai visas by several months they were banned from re-entering the country.\n\nThey are trapped as they have also \"refused to return to Zimbabwe citing their fear for their for their safety due to unrest in Zimbabwe,\" the official said, requesting anonymity.\n\nAirlines have been providing them with food.\n\nZimbabwe's military pushed out 93-year-old despot Robert Mugabe in November paving the way for a transition from decades of mismanagement and authoritarian rule.\n\nBut there has been little unrest and the new president has encouraged Zimbabweans who fled under Mugabe's rule to return home.\n\nThe family have applied for asylum hoping to be resettled outside of Thailand, which does not formally accept refugees.\n\nVivian Tan, a spokeswoman for the UN refugee agency in Bangkok said the UNHCR was \"currently exploring potential solutions\" for the family but could not provide more details for confidentiality reasons.\n\nWith visa-on-arrival agreements with many countries, Thailand has long been a destination for those fleeing civil strife and poverty.\n\nBut it does not allow refugees to legally settle in the kingdom, meaning those seeking asylum need to a find a third country option."}
{"text": "While the surveys were commissioned by Tinder, Ms. Carbino said her position as a social scientist was to provide a valid and realistic view of the world. \"The realistic view might not provide what the company wants,\" she said, \"however it's my responsibility to do so and provide data that is accurate.\"\n\nIt is unclear whether the surveys sampled similar and representative demographics, a fact that Jennifer Lundquist, a sociologist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst who researches online dating, said indicated that more studies were needed to determine if Tinder's surveys were accurate.\n\n\"One issue with the non-online dating comparison group is that given how normalized and destigmatized online dating has become for this age group, it's unusual not to participate in online dating,\" Professor Lundquist said. As a result, she said, the offline daters \"may be a weirdly skewed group, or as sociologists would say negatively select.\"\n\nProfessor Lundquist also questioned the motivations for the survey, pointing to the anecdotal belief among many daters that Tinder's picture-based feature leads it to be a \"hookup\" app rather than a mechanism for finding long-term partners. \"It seems like Tinder is trying to work on their image with this survey,\" she said.\n\nBut despite Tinder's aims, and researchers' varying methods, the app's conclusions about the desire of online daters to commit may not be unfounded. In a 2012 report on a study by the sociologists Michael Rosenfeld and Reuben J. Thomas published in the American Sociological Review, the researchers found that couples who meet online are no more likely to break up than couples who meet offline. Mr. Rosenfeld's continuing research at Stanford University concludes that couples who meet online transition to marriage more quickly than those who meet offline. (The cohort of couples he studied met in 2009, before Tinder was founded; he is currently gathering data that include users of the app.)\n\nStill, it is unclear whether Tinder's surveys, even bolstered by larger trends in online dating, will shift the public's perception of the app. It does not help that in a recent article in The California Sunday Magazine, Tinder's founder and chairman, Sean Rad, admitted to sexting with Snapchat users. But perhaps Ms. Carbino, who scours Tinder daily, sees what others can't: humans trying their best to connect. She is single and said she had found, and lost, love on Tinder."}
{"text": "Is loneliness causing you to short-change your love life? A new study finds the fear of being single may be driving men and women to settle in their relationships.\n\n\"Loneliness is a painful experience for both men and women, so it's not surprising that the fear of being single seems not to discriminate on the basis of gender,\" study co-author, Geoff MacDonald, a professor at the University of Toronto's department of psychology, said in a press release.\n\n\nResearchers asked a sample of adults of various ages from the U.S. and Canada -- including University of Toronto undergraduates -- about their thoughts on being single. They were asked to complete different surveys and tasks.\n\nIn one online survey, 126 women and 27 men were asked about their fears of being alone. About 39 percent said they didn't fear living their lives solo, and almost 12 percent said they both enjoyed the positives and negatives of being single.\n\nBut, over 18 percent admitted they were scared about \"spinsterhood\" and being alone when they died. Another 6.6 percent of mostly younger responders said they were afraid of being lonely as they grew older.\n\n\nIn subsequent experiments and surveys, researchers discovered that both men and women were so scared to be single that they were willing to stay in unfulfilling relationships, and people who had fears of being alone were less likely to get out of a bad relationship.\n\nThey tested the participants' romantic interest in subjects who possessed varying levels of responsiveness and physical attractiveness. People who were apprehensive about being single picked less responsive and less attractive potential dates.\n\nThe above scenario was replicated in a speed-dating environment. Researchers saw fears about being single drove people to be \"less selective\" in showing who they were interested in.\n\nHowever, the fear of being single did not affect people's self-reported standards of what they looked for in a mate, unless parenting factors were involved.\n\nLead author Stephanie Spielmann, a postdoctoral researcher in the University of Toronto's department of psychology, said in a press release that the study could explain why people are willing to stay in relationships even if they are unhappy, and are more willing to date people who they know are not good for them.\n\n\"Now we understand that people's anxieties about being single seem to play a key role in these types of unhealthy relationship behaviors,\" she said.\n\nThe study was published in the December issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology."}
{"text": "Although conservative Democrats are elected all over the United States, most come from Southern states and have been previously known as \"Dixiecrats\" or \"Boll Weevils.\" These terms were not always used in a complimentary fashion by Democratic Party representatives who drew attention to conservative Democrats that did not vote with the party on key issues. For example, the term \"boll weevils\" was frequently applied to conservative Democrats in the 1980s who consistently voted in favor of then Present Ronald Reagan 's increase of military spending, tax cuts and deregulation of the financial system.\n\nIn the United States, a member of the Democratic Party who holds personal political views that are conservative in comparison to those of the majority of his or her political party is known as a conservative democrat . Although views considered typical for a conservative democrat change over time, many support gun rights, a strong military, education, free market capitalism, smaller government, and fiscally conservative policies and may be anti-abortion with a demonstrably stronger religious orientation than moderate and liberal Democrats. Like liberal Republicans, conservative Democrats are a minority wing in the party but may provide deciding votes on divisive political issues.\n\nBefore 1964, both major parties were broken down into liberal, moderate and conservative factions. As the conservative wing of the Republican Party slowly rose to prominence and eventual dominance with the 1980 election of Reagan, Democrats underwent realignment. Rather than grow its conservative wing, the Democrats became markedly more moderate and most members joined the conservative and moderate Democratic Leadership Council.\n\nAs a partial result of the Democratic Party realignment, a conservative Democrat may sometimes find him or herself at odds with the party and more in agreement with Republicans. One of the main points of distinction between conservative Democrats and Republicans is the former's adherence to economic views that are liberal in comparison to those of the latter. In addition, a conservative Democrat may support increasing spending on education and other social programs that a moderate or conservative Republican would not.\n\nBeginning in 1994, conservative Democrats in the House of Representatives and the Senate began organizing themselves in coalitions and caucuses. One of the most well known of these groups in the House is the Blue Dog Democrats whose members profess to support national and financial security as well as bipartisanship. There are other conservative Democrat single-issue caucuses in the House that were formed by pro-life members or those that support gun rights. In the Senate, members of the Democratic Leadership Council generally adopt centrist positions on most issues and promote neo-liberal fiscal policy."}

The current belief is a fairly mild sprain to the ankle, and the Herald's Jeff Howe made it clear that it isdefinitely an ankle injury and not an Achilles issue, which means that he shouldn't miss much time, if any at all.\n\nESPN's Mike Reiss was noted as hearing the injury \"was nothing too too bad.\"\n\nDevin McCourty gets his ankle rolled up. #patriots https://t.co/PjWsTJkan5 — Mike Loyko (@NEPD_Loyko) December 14, 2015\n\nMcCourty pulls up after non-contact. pic.twitter.com/fEZvbntnuk — Rich Hill (@PP_Rich_Hill) December 14, 2015\n\nWhile it would be nice for the full defense to be on the field at any given week, it seems like McCourty should be okay and any injury shouldn't be lasting.\n\nIn other injury updates, linebacker Jonathan Freeny was seen with a cast after the game. Jerod Mayo took his role in the lineup and unsurprisingly outplayed him for yet another week. Hopefully Freeny won't miss any time, though, because he's an excellent special teams player.\n\nDefensive tackle Dominique Easley drew attention for his injury, but he remained on the sideline and worked out on an exercise bike. It's very rare for a player to have a serious injury and to continue to remain on the field, so it's likely a minor issue that won't hold him out for much time. Since he was on a bike, it was likely trying to work out some tightness in his quad, which aligns will his leg giving out on the play.\n\nEasley is clearly concerned about his knees and his reaction was extremely similar to Rob Gronkowski against the Broncos- anything that might be scary gets magnified a trillion times due to the history.\n\nRunning back LeGarrette Blount did not return to the field after halftime after suffering a hip injury. This will be more important to monitor as the Patriots are dangerously thin at running back. We will provide updates as they are available."}

At TechCrunch Disrupt SF today, investors from some of the Valley's top firms discussed how startups are attempting to create a more inclusive environment, especially for women in tech.\n\nChanging the culture of Silicon Valley isn't going to be easy. Cowboy Ventures' Aileen Lee noted that many of these issues crop up because most early-stage startups don't have a head of HR, and are sometimes being founded by people who haven't worked in a professional situation before.\n\n[gallery ids=\"1054486,1054519,1054515,1054514,1054513,1054512,1054511,1054508,1054506,1054505,1054504,1054503,1054501,1054500,1054499,1054497,1054495\"]\n\nIn today's environment, the way startups attract a diverse talent pool will be a key differentiator going forward. Lee went on to say that in many cases, people don't realize that things like harassment and the gender pay gap are illegal. But even beyond that, companies could work harder to make the environment more friendly for their employees.\n\n\"There's probably an opportunity for some sort of a training program,\" Lee said, noting that the industry as a whole doesn't really have the tools that it needs to make more systemic change.\n\nIndex Ventures' Danny Rimer said his firm does a regular audit of how many companies it has invested in that have women as leaders or founders. That number is currently about 15 percent, which might sound low, but is \"surprisingly high for the peer group,\" Rimer said. As part of its efforts, Index tries to find partnerships between portfolio companies and help connect its founders to support one another.\n\nBut more could be done, and that might start with having more female investors to support those entrepreneurs. Greylock's James Slavet noted that the portion of women who are founders and CEOs and the portion of women who are VCs are \"inextricably linked.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Lee thinks it's only a matter of time before one investment firm moves to dramatically change its own ratio. \"The power move would be a high-profile VC firm announce not just one, but two female GPs,\" she said."}

In fact, before the days of the internet it's likely no one would have mentioned it for years, if at all. The changes are quite subtle. Back in 2011, SportsLogos.net ran a post titled Dodgers Change Logo, Nobody Notices. Not many people noticed that post outside of the sports uniform blog scene. In only came to our attention today, nearly 2 years later. From the original article:\n\nThe major minor-changes involve: The leading script into the 'o' of 'Dodgers', it's there in 2010, it's gone in 2012.the 'D' in 'Dodgers' also had a slight change, specifically the curl in the 9-o'clock region of the logo, it's much shorter in the 2012 edition.the flight lines of the baseball have been corrected. Not the most necessary change to ever occur but it does tidy the logo up nicely. As far as we can tell this it the first adjustment of the Dodgers primary logo since their move to Los Angeles from Brooklyn in 1958, that leading tail on the 'o' had been around in one-form-or-another since the 1930s.\n\nPerhaps especially because of the fact that it took even the most logo obsessed fans awhile to notice, the ultras over at Uni Watch were intrigued, so much that they landed an interview with the Dodgers Art Director, Ross Yoshida. Here's part of what he had to say:\n\nThe most obvious change is the thickening of the ball and streaks and making the line weights uniform. This was done mostly to solve the problem of the red lines getting lost at smaller sizes. In addition, the Dodgers script was given an overall \"refresh\"—angles are sharper/cleaner and the script now has a more natural flow (the loop on the D, elimination of the stub on the o, the transition from the g to the e). The end of the underflourish also has an inverted scoop, subtly mimicking the underflourish on our jersey script.\n\nAs far as we can tell by searching Uni Watch, there haven't been any other changes since the 2011/2012 season.

It has been signalling that it wants more money to counter threats it says will arise as a result of the international agreement on Iran's nuclear programme, which Israel's government has staunchly opposed.\n\nCongressional and other U.S. officials cautioned that negotiations on the new aid deal were still in the early stages and the proposal is not yet at the stage where it has been formally brought to Congress, which must approve the funds.\n\n\"First they have to negotiate with the White House,\" one senior congressional aide said of Israel.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is due to visit Washington for talks with President Barack Obama next week, when the package is likely to be discussed and its broad outlines may be agreed.\n\nIsraeli government spokesmen declined to provide details on the defence aid talks.\n\nOne U.S. official said the Obama administration was unlikely to fully meet the Israeli request, and predicted the sides would settle for an annual sum of between $4 billion and $5 billion.\n\nIsrael has also secured hundreds of millions of dollars in additional U.S. funding for missile defence in recent years.\n\nNetanyahu put the brakes on aid talks with Washington in the run-up to the Iran deal that was reached in July, signalling his displeasure with the negotiations. Before he did so, Israeli and U.S. officials said they were looking at a new aid package worth $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion annually.\n\nBoth sides have said that figure could rise after the Iran deal, which will place curbs on Iran's nuclear programme in exchange for an easing of sanctions against Tehran.\n\nIsrael argues that Tehran's financial windfall from sanctions relief will allow it to increase backing for proxies that are hostile to Israel in Syria, Lebanon, the Palestinian territories and elsewhere - a fear Washington says is exaggerated."}
{"text": "In the United States, 2 million people are infected with drug-resistant \"superbugs\" every year, and at least 23,000 die as a result. Such numbers, journalist Maryn McKenna suggests, will seem trivial if we reach the point when all antibiotics are no longer effective -- something that's on track to become a reality.\n\nConsidering the full implications of a post-antibiotic era, McKenna concludes that it wouldn't be so different from the apocalypse. And to know what we're facing, we need only look at where we've come from:\n\nBefore antibiotics, five women died out of every 1,000 who gave birth. One out of nine people who got a skin infection died, even from something as simple as a scrape or an insect bite. Three out of ten people who contracted pneumonia died from it. Ear infections caused deafness; sore throats were followed by heart failure. In a post-antibiotic era, would you mess around with power tools? Let your kid climb a tree? Have another child?\n\nTo start with, McKenna writes, the loss of antibiotics will mean the end of modern medicine as we know it, impeding everything from surgery to chemotherapy to the far more prosaic:\n\nAt UCLA, [Dr. Brad] Spellberg treated a woman with what appeared to be an everyday urinary-tract infection — except that it was not quelled by the first round of antibiotics, or the second. By the time he saw her, she was in septic shock, and the infection had destroyed the bones in her spine. A last-ditch course of the only remaining antibiotic saved her life, but she lost the use of her legs. \"This is what we're in danger of,\" he says. \"People who are living normal lives who develop almost untreatable infections.\"\n\nBut the implications go far beyond human health. Farm animals, themselves believed to be a major source of antibiotic resistance, would suffer too. As they're forced to find more expensive ways to prevent disease, so too will farmers, ultimately driving up the price of meat. More of a fish or fruit person? Those systems, too, are breaking down as antibiotic resistance spreads.\n\nNone of this is inevitable, writes McKenna, but staving it off is going to require us to start taking the issue much more seriously than we currently are. And if anything will convince you this is a true crisis, her article will. Read the entire, terrifying piece at Medium."}

And by 'sell the marketplace' we mean 'play shooters, sometimes for upwards of 20 hours straight.'\n\nExplanation [ edit ]\n\nCrowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining needed services, ideas, or content by soliciting contributions from a large group of people, and especially from an online community, rather than from traditional employees or suppliers. In the new Internet economy, it is not uncommon for companies to rely on crowdsourced designs or ideas, to contract the marketing to another firm, or to interact with customers through social networks established by other companies.\n\nCueball, however, is describing a business strategy which manages to do all three by \"crowdsourcing\" the process of getting a company and a prospective employee together. Cueball describes it as helping people with ideas find funding, similar to Kickstarter or Indiegogo, but rather than setting up a system to facilitate the process, he plans to use already-existing social networks (such as Facebook and Twitter). Effectively, by relying on outside support for all steps of the business plan, his company does nothing; however, because the parts of his strategy are all feasible separately, and because he describes them with a barrage of trendy buzzwords, his audience is impressed and fails to notice the company's essential pointlessness.\n\nIn the title text Cueball claims that \"we don't sell a product, we sell the marketplace,\" a phrase that typically describes a company whose business model is to facilitate the business of other companies. However, this is revealed to be yet more empty buzzwords when Cueball clarifies that they don't actually do any work and instead play video games (\"shooters\" refer to first person shooters, a genre of video game).\n\nTranscript [ edit ]\n\n[Cueball is standing in front of a flowchart on a wall, indicating with a pointer. A man and two women are looking on with interest. One woman holds a briefcase.] Cueball: We crowdsource the design process, allowing those with the best designs to connect— Cueball: via already-in-place social networking infrastructure— Cueball: with interested manufacturers, distributors, and marketers.\n\nNobody caught on that our business plan didn't involve us in any way— it was just a description of other people making and selling products.\n\n\nDiscussion"}

{"text": "CNN: At least 40 vets died while waiting for care at Phoenix VA\n\nAt least 40 U.S. veterans died while waiting for health care at the Phoenix VA, many of whom were placed on a secret waiting list, according to a CNN report.\n\nThe \"elaborate scheme,\" implemented by top management, was an effort to hide that 1,400 to 1,600 sick veterans waited months to see a doctor, said CNN, citing a former Veterans Administration doctor and other agency staff. The secret list also gave the appearance of shorter appointment wait times, which were reported back to Washington, according to the story.\n\nThe report quotes a recently retired doctor from the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care System, Dr. Sam Foote, who explained the protocol for misreporting appointment requests.\n\nAccording to Foote, when vets requested a medical appointment, their info would be entered into hospital computers but not saved. A screen grab of the actual appointment data was printed, added to the secret electronic list, then shredded, erasing any public record that the actual appointment was made.\n\n\"So the only record that you have ever been there requesting care was on that secret list,\" Foote said in the CNN story. \"And they wouldn't take you off that secret list until you had an appointment time that was less than 14 days so it would give the appearance that they were improving greatly the waiting times, when in fact they were not.\"\n\nThe article references the family of a 71-year-old Navy veteran who had difficulty getting a follow-up appointment after they rushed him to the Phoenix VA emergency room because of blood in his urine.\n\nDespite a history of cancer and a chart identifying him as urgent, Thomas Breen's family could not get him in for an appointment.\n\nBreen's wife said she called daily for appointments from late September 2013 through November. Breen died Nov. 30.\n\n\"They called me December 6,\" his wife Sally told CNN.\n\nThe Phoenix VA Health Care System responded to the story, writing they would \"welcome the results from the Office of Inspector General's review.\"\n\nThe statement went on: \"We acknowledge Phoenix VA Health Care System has had longstanding issues with Veterans accessing care and have taken numerous actions to meet demand, while we continue to serve more Veterans and enhance our services.\"\n\nLawmakers have since called that all records at the Phoenix VA be preserved, according to CNN.\n\nnews@stripes.com"}
{"text": "Vladimir Putin said Moscow had \"many friends\" in US and hoped that one day situation would right itself.\n\n© Thomson Reuters 2017\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia would be forced to retaliate if Washington pressed ahead with what he called illegal new sanctions against Moscow, describing US conduct towards his country as boorish and unreasonable.Putin, speaking on a visit to Finland, was commenting on a vote by the US House of Representatives which on Tuesday decided to impose new sanctions on Moscow and to force President Donald Trump to obtain lawmakers' permission before easing any sanctions on Russia.The sanctions have yet to be approved by the Senate or Trump, and a top White House aide said on Thursday that Trump could veto the legislation in order to push for a tougher deal.Putin, who has repeatedly denied US allegations that Russia interfered with last year's US presidential election, said Moscow would only decide on how to retaliate against Washington once it had seen the final text of the proposed law.\"As you know, we are exercising restraint and patience, but at some moment we'll have to retaliate. It's impossible to endlessly tolerate this boorishness towards our country,\" Putin told a joint news conference with his Finnish counterpart.\"When will our response follow? What will it be? That will depend on the final version of the draft law which is now being debated in the US Senate.\"Putin also spoke about an ongoing diplomatic row between Moscow and Washington which erupted last December when then US President Barack Obama ordered the seizure of Russian diplomatic property in the United States and the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats.\"This goes beyond all reasonable bounds,\" said Putin. \"And now these sanctions - they are also absolutely unlawful from the point of view of international law.\"Calling the proposed sanctions \"extremely cynical,\" Putin said the demarche looked like an attempt by Washington to use its \"geopolitical advantages ... to safeguard its economic interests at the expense of its allies\".He dismissed Congressional investigations into Russia's alleged meddling in last year's US presidential election, calling them a symptom of growing anti-Russian hysteria in the United States and a result of US domestic politics.\"It's very sad that US-Russian relations are being sacrificed to resolve internal policy issues in the US,\" said Putin. \"It's a pity, because acting together we could be solving jointly the most acute problems that worry the peoples of Russia and the United States much more efficiently.\" However, Putin said that Moscow had \"many friends\" in the United States and hoped that one day the situation would right itself."}
{"text": "Cesar Gracie has a flair for the dramatic, and when he announced that Nick Diaz will be returning and actually wants a superfight with UFC middleweight champion Anderson Silva, he certainly lived up to his reputation. Personally I think it's ridiculous, but hardly surprising coming from Gracie or Diaz. Gracie went into more detail in an interview with Middle Easy, stating that it's not about jumping the line for a title shot - it's about a superfight (transcribed by MMA Mania):\n\n\"Why Anderson? Because Anderson is a huge name. He's talking the talk that is kind of what we're talking about. He's talking about doing superfights. He's talking about the things that Nick's been talking about that Nick did when he was with Strikeforce that Nick is into. That's why. And he's exciting and just a great fighter. He's talking about catchweights, he's talking about exciting fights that people want to see instead of being limited to fighting, you know, if this is your weight class, if this is the number one contender, this guy did this, this guy did that. We're not interested.... people are thinking now, 'Why does Nick want to fight this guy? Why does Nick get a shot at the title?' It's not about the title. If he was at 185, we don't want the title. Nick isn't trying to be disrespectful to other great middleweights out there on campus and want that. There are a lot of great middleweights that are at the front of the line for a title shot. This is about fighting and a superfight.\"\n\nGracie also says some other interesting stuff in the interview, the two most controversial points probably being that \"no one cares about Georges St. Pierre vs. Carlos Condit\" and that \"Anderson Silva thought Diaz beat Condit\" in their UFC 143 bout. Anderson's manager Ed Soares is playing along though, at least for right now. He sent out this tweet over the weekend:\n\nI think the idea of @SpiderAnderson vs @nickdiaz209 is pretty good. Let's see what the @ufc thinks? — Ed Soares (@edblackhouse) July 28, 2012\n\nThere's not much chance of this actually happening, and it's all a bit silly to be honest. But, much like the GSP/Silva superfight that's been talked about forever, I'm sure we'll continue to hear about this for a while."}

In 50-50 battles, won 831 of 1,596.\n\nCreative core — 120 scoring chances and in a more advanced role last season had 11 goal assists.\n\n\nHaving established himself as arguably the club's second-most influential player behind Van Persie, Song felt he was entitled to an improved contract and tried to open talks over a pay rise.\n\nHe will earn around £70,000 a week at Barcelona.\n\nIt is understood Song's advisers tried to initiate contact over a new contract in January.\n\n\nHowever, sources close to Song insist Arsenal delayed attempts by the 24-year-old to negotiate, leaving the player disillusioned.\n\n\nSong is said to have been desperate to commit his long-term future to the club, but felt his salary should have been on a par with other top earners."}

{"text": "The Apache Foundation has added a new machine learning project to its roster, Apache PredictionIO, an open-sourced version of a project originally devised by a subsidiary of Salesforce.\n\nWhat PredictionIO does for machine learning and Spark\n\nApache PredictionIO is built atop Spark and Hadoop, and serves Spark-powered predictions from data using customizable templates for common tasks. Apps send data to PredictionIO's event server to train a model, then query the engine for predictions based on the model.\n\nSpark, MLlib, HBase, Spray, and and Elasticsearch all come bundled with PredictionIO, and Apache offers supported SDKs for working in Java, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Data can be stored in a variety of back ends: JDBC, Elasticsearch, HBase, HDFS, and their local file systems are all supported out of the box. Back ends are pluggable, so a developer can create a custom back-end connector.\n\nHow PredictionIO templates make it easier to serve predictions from Spark\n\nPredictionIO's most notable advantage is its template system for creating machine learning engines. Templates reduce the heavy lifting needed to set up the system to serve specific kinds of predictions. They describe any third-party dependencies that might be needed for the job, such as the Apache Mahout machine-learning app framework.\n\nSome existing templates include:\n\nSome templates also integrate with other machine learning products. For example, two of the prediction templates currently in PredictionIO's gallery, for churn rate detection and general recommendations, use H2O.ai's Sparkling Water enhancements for Spark.\n\nPredictionIO can also automatically evaluate a prediction engine to determine the best hyperparameters to use with it. The developer needs to choose and set metrics for how to do this, but there's generally less work involved in doing this than in tuning hyperparameters by hand.\n\nWhen running as a service, PredictionIO can accept predictions singly or as a batch. Batched predictions are automatically parallelized across a Spark cluster, as long as the algorithms used in a batch prediction job are all serializable. (PredictionIO's default algorithms are.)\n\nWhere to download PredictionIO\n\nPredictionIO's source code is available on GitHub. For convenience, various Docker images are available, as well as a Heroku build pack.\n\nThis story, \"Apache PredictionIO: Easier machine learning with Spark\" was originally published by InfoWorld ."}
{"text": "After a harrowing ordeal, the abducted men were returned to their homes on Saturday afternoon. The bodyguards were bruised and in tears as they were helped from vehicles, but they were alive, and the potential political crisis the episode could have set off seemed to have been averted for the moment. To celebrate their return, a sheep was slaughtered, women threw candies in the air and men fired long bursts of celebratory gunfire across the roofs of the densely packed Sunni neighborhood of Adhamiya.\n\n\"We are living in a jungle,\" Mr. Adhadh said in an interview at his home shortly after his release.\n\nA portion of Iraq — Mosul in the north and much of Anbar Province in the west — is under control of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. There are contested areas to the north and east of the capital, near Tikrit and Samarra and in Diyala Province, where fighting rages and where a brutal sectarian war seems to be unfolding. On Saturday, all five members of a Shiite family, including children, were found beheaded in the town of Taji. On Sunday, Shiite militiamen hung the bodies of at least six Sunni militants from streetlights and a bridge in Baquba, the capital of Diyala Province.\n\nIn Baghdad, though, where political leaders are struggling to keep the country together, a different picture has emerged. The wholesale sectarian slaughter that nearly tore the country apart in 2006 and 2007 has not yet returned, but militias, loyal to a sect or sometimes to just a man, are back. And the mass arrests of Sunni men, at the heart of grievances that allowed the insurgency to gain support within the Sunni community, have continued. It is a gangland culture deeply intertwined with the culture of Iraqi politics.\n\nThe effort to win Mr. Adhadh's release involved the new speaker of Parliament and Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, as well as pressure on Iraqi leaders from Western diplomats who feared that the episode would further destabilize the political situation and heighten sectarian tensions.\n\nBut it was the direct intervention of a powerful militia leader that ultimately secured Mr. Adhadh's freedom: Qais al-Khazali, the leader of Asaib Ahl al-Haq, a Shiite militant and political group with close ties to Iran. The group once fought the Americans, and more recently has fought in Syria's civil war on the side of the government of President Bashar al-Assad."}

Then, one can hear a single voice among the protestors shout out \"Kill the Jews.\" The calls to violence swelled as the other protestors joined.

He has tried to persuade President Obama to reject any kind of agreement with Iran, most recently arguing it could threaten Israel's very existence.\n\nYet, the Obama administration is full speed ahead with a preliminary agreement that in part lifts all sanctions against Iran. The president insists these terms are America's 'best bet' and legislators such as Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) are chiding Netanyahu as if he was a child: \"I wish Netanyahu would contain himself.'\n\nPerhaps Netanyahu is not containing himself because he recognizes the many threats Israel faces. If you were the prime minister and watched the above video, would you too not want to ensure Israel's safety?"}

Senators did approve amendments that seek to limit the public release of gun-ownership information and that encourage mental-health awareness and school-violence prevention efforts.\n\nMonday is the deadline for interest groups, companies and others with business before the federal government to submit reports, detailing their lobbying activity during the first quarter of the year.\n\nAs of midafternoon, new lobbying reports had not been filed on behalf of the leading gun-control groups, including Americans for Responsible Solutions, a new group led by former Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in the head while meeting with constituents in January 2011. The group recently hired two lobbying firms to advance its agenda on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn the past, gun-control advocates have failed to match the NRA's spending. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, for instance, spent $40,000 on lobbying last year – an amount dwarfed by the $2.5 million spent by the NRA in 2012.\n\nThe NRA's filing shows it employs 12 in-house lobbyists, including its highly visible executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/ZKeIre"}

{"text": "The Coalition For Economic Survival (CES) urges a NO vote on Measure S, on the March 7, 2017 Los Angeles City ballot\n\nCES believes Measure S threatens to delay or stop projects that would otherwise provide affordable housing, and housing for homeless people.\n\nMeasure S puts a two-year moratorium on development projects requiring certain zoning or height exemptions, and permanently prohibits developments requiring a general plan amendment. Thus, it could stop projects that would provide permanent supportive housing for people that are homeless – housing that voters approved with the passage of Measure HHH last November.\n\nClearly, there is a great need for government action to protect neighborhoods and much more action is needed to preserve our existing rent controlled and affordable housing stock. In fact, this lack of action at City Hall, no doubt, opened the door for Measure S to make it to the ballot.\n\nMeasure S does have some good provisions. The City should be updating community plans. Obviously, in response to Measure S, the City Council just voted to back an effort to update community plans more frequently.\n\nAdditionally, developers should not be allowed to select environmental impact report consultants for their projects.\n\nBut, it is our belief that Measure S is a sledgehammer approach that does not provide a solution. In fact, it may make matters worse.\n\nMeasure S is not the answer and should be voted down.\n\nMeasure S\n\nDoes Not Stop Ellis Act evictions\n\nDoes Not Stop condo conversions\n\nDoes Not Stop rent controlled housing being demolished. In fact it may led to the destruction of rent controlled buildings.\n\nDoes Not Create new affordable housing\n\nDoes Not Stop big developers from donating to elected officials\n\nMeasure S DOES Stop Affordable Housing from Being Built\n\nMeasure S would provide an incentive to developer to destroy more rent controlled buildings.\n\nA two year moratorium on development targeted in Measure S could steer developers towards other types of development such as more demolitions and conversions of rent controlled housing to condos resulting in further displacement of low and moderate income renters.\n\nThe Measure S moratorium, and its permanent prohibition on the City's ability to issue general plan amendments, will be stop the building of affordable housing. Although the backers of Measure S claim to exempt affordable housing, Measure S does not actually exempt all 100% affordable housing projects from its reach, and would effectively stop 90% of city-sponsored affordable housing projects.\n\nIt is for these reasons CES Urges You to Vote NO on Measure S!\n\nAdvertisements"}

{"text": "in 1886, the head of the Egyptian Antiquities Service, Gaston Maspero who was unwrapping the mummies of the 40 kings and queens, taking mummies out of their sarcophagi, unwrapping them, dictating all kinds of notes, when noticed an unusually plain burial box.\n\nUnlike the kings and queens he'd been working, this particular box didn't give any information as to the identity of the stiff inside. Even stranger, the body was wrapped in sheepskin, which was considered unclean by ancient Egyptians. When he finally opened the coffin, Maspero found himself even more shocked. he found this screaming, undead face looking back at him.\n\nwrapped in a sheep or goatskin – a ritually unclean object for ancient Egyptians – lay the body of a young man, his face locked in an eternal blood-curdling scream. It was a spine-tingling sight, and one that posed even more troubling questions: here was a mummy, carefully preserved, yet caught in the moment of death in apparently excruciating pain.\n\nCalled both \"Unknown Man E\" and the \"Screaming Mummy\" because of his open jaw and agonized expression, the mummy has baffled researchers since it was first uncovered. Experts theorized that the body had been poisoned, buried alive or otherwise tortured before his untimely death.\n\nHe had been buried in exalted company, yet been left without an inscription, ensuring he would be consigned to eternal damnation, as the ancient Egyptians believed identity was the key to entering the afterlife. Moreover, his hands and feet had been so tightly bound that marks still remained on the bones.\n\nsince Unknown Man E, there have been several more \"screaming\" mummies found in various digs all around the world. Mummies with their mouths agape or lips pulled back as if they are screaming or writhing in pain are truly startling. Two of the most famous–designated Unknown Woman A and Unknown Man E. Such mummies, however, are found not just in Egypt but worldwide, in Palermo, Sicily, Guanajuato, Mexico, and in Peru. Some of these bodies were purposefully preserved, though by various methods, while others are natural or, you might say, accidental mummies.\n\nAre screaming mummies really testaments to horrific deaths? Or are they the result of natural processes, botched or ad hoc mummification jobs, or the depredations of tomb robbers?"}
{"text": "Approximately 46 percent of single, uninsured young adults living in 34 of the states with a federal Obamacare marketplace will be able to purchase basic health coverage — a bare-bones \"Bronze\" level plan — for less than $50 per month after factoring in federal tax subsidies, according to a new report by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\nAn even greater number of young and uninsured single adults between the ages of 18 and 34 will be able to get coverage for less than $100 per month, according to government data. \"Of [the 2.9 million] potentially Marketplace-eligible uninsured single young adults, approximately 1.9 million… may be able to pay $100 or less per month in 2014,\" wrote the report authors. That's nearly two-thirds of young adults who qualify for Obamacare marketplace coverage in the 34 states.\n\nAn additional one million young adults will also now qualify for Medicaid coverage under Obamacare's expansion of the program. All told, the report finds that 40 percent of the 7.2 million young, uninsured adults living in the 34 states will be able to get coverage for $100 per month or less thanks to the health law. That works out to be 2.9 million people.\n\nIf all of the 34 states had chosen to expand Medicaid, however, that number would actually spike to 6.2 million people. That's because many young adults earn little enough money to qualify for the program under Obamacare's Medicaid expansion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier independent studies have found that families who qualify for Obamacare's subsidies will get an average annual credit of $5,548 per year to help pay for insurance under the law. That would cover a full 66 percent of these families' health premiums. A September report by HHS also found that 6.4 million Americans across all ages can get insurance through Obamacare's marketplaces for less than $100 per month.\n\nThose figures provide a contrast with recent reports that the health law is driving up individual policy premiums and even causing consumers to get cancellation notices from insurers. These stories tend to ignore the reality that many of these plans allure customers with deceptively low monthly premiums, but offer skimpy benefits, fail to cover out-of-pocket costs, and come loaded with high deductibles that are of little help in the case of a medical emergency. Obamacare marketplace plans must offer a wider variety of benefits, cannot deny people based on having a pre-existing medical condition, and limit cost-sharing depending on a person's income."}

{"text": "There's constantly some sort of plagiarism row going on in fashion. Whether it's Mango copying Gucci's silk dresses, Nasty Gal copying Saint Laurent's platform sandals, designer's copying other designers, artists or, as was most recently the case, the designs of indigenous cultures and tribes. Last week, London-based fashion label KTZ were in hot water over the \"Shaman Towelling Sweatshirt\" featured in their AW15 collection – a design which Salome Awa says was copied from her great-grandfather Aua, one of the last Shaman of the Canadian Inuit.\n\n\"They must have seen it and copied it,\" Awa told The Evening Standard, \"They even called the clothing Shaman... My great-grandfather was a very powerful and respected man and he has been used and violated. It was disgusting to see a sacred design used as a sweater... We are a proud people and our ancestors and traditions are very important to us. The way they have taken and degraded this design is unacceptable.\" The design itself featured in 2006 film The Journals of Knud Rasmussen as well as some books on the culture of the Inuit such as \"Northern Voices\".\n\nIn response KTZ, who show at London Fashion Week, have issued a formal apology to Awa saying the brand has \"always been inspired by and paid homage to indigenous cultures and tribes around the world\" and that it's part of their DNA to \"celebrate multiculturalism as a form of art and to encourage appreciation for traditions, ethnicities and religions' diversity\". As well as emphasising the multiculturalism of their company, they said that the Inuit community was credited in the press release and that they have already removed the item from sale.\n\nAwa's response to the apology was bittersweet, telling CBC North, \"\"I'm kind of happy about it but sad at the same time... They didn't even mention an apology to my great-grandfather and they didn't even offer any monetary gains to our family... This is a stolen piece. There is no way that this fashion designer could have thought of this exact duplicate by himself.\" Awa goes on to say that she has some questions from the brand. \"Why did you not ask us in the first place?\" she asks. \"How they obtained the exact replica? Why did they not ask our family? Did they not think we exist? Why are they doing this to other indigenous clothing?\"\n\nRead KTZ's full letter to Salome Awa below:"}

{"text": "Heifer so lonely: How cows have best friends and get stressed when they are separated\n\nCows have best friends and become stressed if they are separated, according to a scientist.\n\nKrista McLennan, who made the discovery while working on her PhD at Northampton University, believes her findings could help improve milk yields.\n\nThe 27-year-old measured the heart rates and cortisol levels of cows to see how they cope when isolated.\n\nWe want to be together: Cows have best friends within their herds and become stressed if separated, a study has found\n\nCattle were penned on their own, with their best friend or with another cow they did not know for 30 minutes and their heart rates were measured at 15-second intervals.\n\n\nThe research showed cows were very social animals which often formed close bonds with friends in their herd.\n\n'When heifers have their preferred partner with them, their stress levels in terms of their heart rates are reduced compared with if they were with a random individual,' Ms McLennan said.\n\n\n'If we can encourage farmers to keep an eye out for those cows which like to keep their friends with them, it could have some real benefits, such as improving their milk yields and reducing stress for the animals, which is very important for their welfare.\n\n'I've spoken to a number of farmers who have said they do notice bonds building among their cows and some spending a lot of time together.'\n\nMs McLennan pointed out that modern farming practices mean cows are often separated for visits from the vet or by farmers moving their stock around.\n\nI'm stressed! Krista McLennan's research could help improve milk yields by helping farmers better understand how to keep their cows happy\n\n'We know re-grouping cows is a problem, because there's a high level of stress among animals as they try to integrate into a new group.'\n\nShe now hopes her suggestion that cows like to stay with their best friends will be taken on by the dairy industry.\n\nTrevor Foss, chairman of the Northamptonshire branch of the NFU, said the research could be of real use to dairy farmers.\n\nHe said 'I've heard people say if you leave the radio on for the cows they're a lot happier, so there might be something in this.\n\n'I suppose cows must be a bit like humans.\n\n'Some might like to be on their own while others might not.'"}
{"text": "Dinosaurs with sharp spikes on their backs may have had sex in a prehistoric variant on the missionary position to prevent castration or even death.\n\nNew research disputes the theory that the prehistoric beasts all had sex the same way, with the male mounting the female from behind.\n\nFor some dinosaurs, particularly herbivores such as the Stegosaurus, which had a stiff, spiky tail, such a position could have proved dangerous or even fatal.\n\n\"The females could not raise their tails because the bones at the top end were fused,\" Brian Switek told the Sunday Times. The dinosaur researcher and writer is the author of a book, My Beloved Brontosaurus: On the Road with Old Bones, New Science, and Our Favourite Dinosaurs.\n\nHeinrich Mallison, a scientist at the Museum of Natural History in Berlin, has designed computer models of Kentrosaurus, a cousin of Stegosaurus, to see if males could have risked mounting the females. He found that any such approach would have \"risked castration\" from the deadly spikes on its hips.\n\n\"These prickly dinosaurs must have had sex another way. Perhaps the female lay down on her side and the male reared up to rest his torso over her,\" he said.\n\nScientists have grappled with hypothetical ideas about how dinosaurs had sex for years. As soft-tissue preservation is very rare, and there has yet to be the discovery of a dinosaur with a complete set of reproductive organs intact, many theories abound.\n\n\"We have never found a fossilised phallus,\" Switek told the Sunday Times. \"But doing so would solve many mysteries.\"\n\nAs a result, some ideas certainly stretch the imagination to its limits. In his 1906 paper describing Tyrannosaurus Rex, palaeontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn suggested that the five-ton dinosaurs used their minuscule arms for \"grasping during copulation\".\n\nOther scientists believe that according to scale, the penis of a tyrannosaur would be around 12 feet long.\n\nThis must have led to some very complicated manoeuvres. \"Mounting from the rear, he put his forelimbs on her shoulders, lifting one hind limb across her back and twisting his tail under hers,\" suggested Dr Beverly Halstead in Omni, a science magazine.\n\nBiologist Stuart Landry has come up with a more plausible theory - that dinosaurs mated in the water - which would have supported their enormous bulk."}
{"text": "Imagine if you could plug an external graphics card into your MacBook, then use it for for virtual reality or other gaming. You'd never need a dedicated gaming computer again.\n\nThat's the dream behind The Wolfe, an external graphics card for the Mac that hits Kickstarter tomorrow. Two versions of this Thunderbolt accessory, The Wolfe and The Wolfe Pro, offer an Nvidia GTX 950 and GTX 970 respectively.\n\nThe card fits into a case that's a 7.8 inches deep by 5.4 inches wide and 2.6 inches tall, which weighs between two and 3.2 pounds. Stick this in your bag with your laptop, the theory goes, and you've got a portable gaming MacBook.\n\nRelated: No Rift support for Mac until 'Apple releases a good computer,' says Oculus founder\n\nMacs, shall we say, do not have the best reputation among gamers. Apple builds its laptops with portability and battery life in mind, not graphical performance. And in general, laptops built specifically for gaming tend to be heavy with awful battery life.\n\nThe Wolfe could offer a third path, if it works well. It gives you graphics when you need it, but leaves the MacBook highly portable the rest of the time. Road To VR is reporting that the Wolfe is compatible with the following laptops:\n\nMacBook Air 11-inch, Mid 2011–2015\n\nMacBook Air 13-inch, Mid 2011–2015\n\nMacBook Pro Retina, 13-inch, Late 2012–2015\n\nMacBook Pro Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2012–2015\n\nMacBook Pro 13-inch, Early 2011–2015\n\nMacBook Pro 15-inch, Early 2011–2015\n\nMac mini, Mid 2011–2015\n\niMac, Mid 2011–2015\n\nMac Pro, Late 2013-2015\n\nIndeed, VR is part of the product pitch. The website for The Wolfe shows a user using Oculus Rift alongside a MacBook. Since Oculus doesn't support Mac officially, we believe it is only possible if the laptop is boot into Windows using Bootcamp. No official word has been given as to how the Rift compatibility would be enabled.\n\nIt's not clear what The Wolfe and Wolfe Pro will cost, but we can read the tea leaves. The Nvidia GTX 950 costs around $160, and the GTX 970 costs around $250. We'd expect The Wolfe to mark those costs up considerably. We'll get more details tomorrow, when The Wolfe pops up on Kickstarter. Stay tuned."}
{"text": "By Chris Kahn\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton has opened up a double-digit lead over Republican rival Donald Trump, regaining ground after the New York billionaire briefly tied her last month, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday.\n\nThe shift in support comes as Clinton steps up her attacks on the real estate mogul's policy positions, and as Trump fends off criticisms of his eponymous university and the pace at which he doled out money that he raised for U.S. veterans.\n\nSome 46 percent of likely voters said they supported Clinton, while 35 percent said they supported Trump, and another 19 percent said they would not support either, according to the survey of 1,421 people conducted between May 30 and June 3.\n\nTrump had briefly tied Clinton in support among likely U.S. voters in mid-May, raising expectations for a tight race between the two likely contenders in November's presidential election.\n\nTrump has all but sealed the Republican nod after a string of big wins in state nominating contests forced his party rivals to drop out, while Clinton is still fending off a long-shot bid for the Democratic spot on the ballot by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\nClinton is hoping to seal the nomination next week, when a slew of big states including New Jersey and California will hold primaries, allowing her to consolidate her party's support ahead of a general election matchup against Trump.\n\nClinton's polling surge comes as Trump is been harangued by criticisms over his Trump University, the target of a trio of lawsuits that claim it misled thousands of people who paid up to $35,000 for seminars to learn about Trump's investment strategies. Trump has defended the school and said he will relaunch it once the litigation ends.\n\nTrump this week also outlined the recipients of millions of dollars in donations he raised at an event in January for veterans' groups, in a bid to end speculation that he had not yet handed over all of the money.\n\nOn Thursday, Clinton used a foreign policy speech in California to paint Trump's policy platform as \"dangerously incoherent\" and cast her Republican rival as both a frightening and laughable figure.\n\nTrump responded by saying she lied about his positions and by ripping her record as secretary of state, which he says was marred her handling of government emails and the death of a U.S. ambassador in Libya.\n\n(Writing by Richard Valdmanis; Editing by Leslie Adler)"}

It urged network providers to seek other vendors.\n\nThe report also advised officials to to block any future business tie-ups involving Huawei or ZTE and US companies.\n\nHuawei, the world's second-largest maker of routers and other telecom gear, and ZTE, the fifth-largest, both rejected the allegations.

Another former senior US intelligence official said the threat of illegal eavesdropping may be more theoretical than actual.\n\nOn Monday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers referred to alleged instances of \"beaconing\" of information to China, though he did not name any specific users of Huawei's equipment that had been affected.\n\nIn Britain, the Chinese firm's gear sits at the core of BT's national phone network and is being used to build 4G mobile broadband networks."}
{"text": "In a shocking turn of events, MINI corporate in Munich have released an official statement that based on the overwhelmingly negative response to the spied photos of the F56's pre-production interior, they're sending the MINI Design Team back to the drawing board. Way back, in fact. They're sending them all the way back to 1958.\n\nApril 1st 2013, Munich. Official release: Due to overwhelming negative response on the MINI news site MotoringFile.com, the MINI Design Team have decided to scrap the planned interior redesign in the upcoming 2014 MINI. Instead, based on consistent feedback that the interior be in touch with its Mini roots, the team have opted to retrograde the design back to the original 1958 Mini interior design.\n\nTo stay on schedule for a fall release, they've worked feverishly over the weekend to integrate modern technology and conveniences that consumers around the world demand. As seen in the accompanying photographs, designers have managed to integrate airbags, infotainment, HVAC controls paired with large vents, and a stand-alone tachometer. However, there is work yet to be done. Designers are working feverishly to render a rear-view mirror larger than the classic unit, which is roughly the size of \"a deck of cards.\" Additionally, updated upholstery will be fitted throughout, following yet more consumer feedback that the original materials reminded drivers of \"their grandmother's couch.\"\n\nSafety considerations have not been forgotten in devolving the new MINI's interior. Soft touch foams and plastics will be used throughout to help soften any occupant \"contact\" during unexpected decelerations. The team is considering departing from the original Mini even further by including seat belts.\n\nMINI Designers were puzzled to find that once their evolutions to the original were complete, they'd arrived at approximately the interior design for the current generation MINI Hardtop. However, this still has room for improvement. The team plans to look into enlarging the navigation screen, simplifying the HVAC and radio controls, and combining the tachometer and speedometers into a single gauge cluster for better driver convenience. Finer materials are also in consideration, as well as possibly better technological integration for today's ever more connected drivers. The final design will be unveiled later this year, and the MINI Design Team has high hopes that given all this incorporated input from the MINI enthusiast community, the newly re-refreshed interior will be a big hit with MINI fans around the world."}

{"text": "Green Revolution\n\nWhat does the future of farming and agriculture look like? According to researchers from MIT, pretty good—that is, if we look towards today's technological breakthroughs to ensure it.\n\nThe team has come to a positive, yet unexpected possibility—that urban agriculture might be on the verge of an Internet-enabled revolution. Meaning, given that technology has now enabled new farming techniques and opportunities that allow for indoor, warehouse-based settings, food production can potentially accommodate high-density urban demands and maintain food security despite our unstable environment and exposure to vulnerabilities.\n\nAnd right now, a team of MIT technologists are working on creating a networked agricultural system anchored on the open-source software movement for inspiration.\n\n\"The current state of [networked agriculture] is very one-off,\" says Caleb Harper, principal research scientist for the Open Agriculture (OpenAG) Initiative at MIT's Media Lab. \"Everybody designs their own little unique 'data center' for plants, for a warehouse farm or for a vertical farm. They say it's super special, and they try to create intellectual property out of it. And they won't let people go in it, because they don't want other people to steal their brilliant ideas. That's the problem in my industry now. They haven't realized that there's a system that underlies this. And it won't scale until there is a common platform.\"\n\nThe Food Computer\n\nThis new platform that Harper is developing is a digitized food-growing system he dubs the \"Food Computer\" and it creates a controlled environment ideal for farming using robotic controls and actuated climate energy as well as plant sensing mechanisms.\n\nIt's designed to optimize agricultural production basically by creating the ideal climate inside a controlled chamber.\n\nTo do that, the Food Computer monitor will monitor and fine-tune elements such as light exposure, humidity, temperature, C02 level, water cycles, and nutrient delivery following a preset recipe.\n\nThe key here is that recipes for different crops, including the software that controls and monitors the data will be circulated freely among Food Computer users, allowing them to collaborate to tweak and improve the process depending on their current environment—whether they're in the tropics or the Antarctic.\n\nThere are less than 10 Food Computers being used worldwide, but these are expected to grow. The growth of computerized vertical farming continues to boom and experts believe that the numbers will only get bigger in the coming years, thanks to the increasingly efficient technology of LED grow lights available today."}

{"text": "Interference with a Tuning Fork If you strike a tuning fork and rotate it next to your ear, you will note that the sound alternates between loud and soft as you rotate through the angles where the interference is constructive and destructive. It is challenging to visualize this in a diagram because of the large difference in scale between the tuning fork and the wavelengths of the sound produced. A tuning fork to produce equal tempered middle-C (C 4 , 261.6Hz) would have a dimension of a few centimeters, but the sound wavelength at room temperature would be about 1.3 m or over four feet. This is an attempt to qualitatively visualize the interference from a binary source using a photo of the interference pattern in a ripple tank with a double vibrator. That photo is superimposed on a sketch of a tuning fork in the hope that it might give some insight about the nature of interference in waves from a double source. But the scale here is profoundly different: the separation of the two ripple tank wave sources is several wavelengths, whereas the separation of the two tines of the C-tuning fork is maybe 1/50th of the wavelength. This pattern would suggest several minima of loudness, whereas the tuning fork gives four minima at 45° from the plane of the two tines when rotated. Animations of the interference patterns with single and multiple sources may be found at Dan Russell's site at Penn State. The pattern at right is from the animation of a lateral quadrupole source. This is the best approximation of the interference of the tuning fork since the two tines of the fork are out of phase, and Russell notes that two opposite phase dipoles make up a lateral quadrupole source. This diagram gets closer to what you experience by rotating the tuning fork by your ear, but the problem of scale is still present since the sound wavelength for the C tuning fork is fifty times the size of the physical vibrator. This diagram shows that Russell's lateral quadrupole gives equal intensities at 90°. But with the tuning fork, your ear tells you that the maxima in the plane of the two tines is significantly stronger than the maxima perpendicular to that plane. Each tine of the fork produces a pressure wave which travels outward at the speed of sound. One part of the wave has a pressure higher than atmospheric pressure, another lower. At some angles the high pressure areas of the two waves coincide and you hear a louder sound. At other angles, the high pressure part of one wave coincides with the low pressure part of the other."}
{"text": "Don't let the Mickey Mouse shirt fool you. As far as the MPAA is concerned, the public needs a reminder of who Richard O'Dwyer really is.\n\n\"Being 24, posing for newspaper photo shoots in a cartoon sweatshirt, and having your mother and Jimmy Wales speak for you, does not mean you are incapable for [sic] breaking the law.\"\n\nThe reminder above comes from a supposedly leaked MPAA memo obtained by TorrentFreak. It outlines talking points when discussing the much publicized O'Dwyer case, involving the 24-year-old and the \"link site\" he used to run. TVShack.net didn't directly host possibly infringing materials, but the site did link to such videos. While this would likely be legal under UK law, O'Dwyer landed squarely in the crosshairs of US copyright enforcers. This spring, news broke that O'Dwyer would be extradited to the US for this alleged copyright infringement despite no locally illegal activities being performed in his UK home. O'Dwyer is currently appealing this decision, but the July timeline for an appeal decision was delayed without concrete rescheduling.\n\nO'Dwyer's fight sparked Internet activism of the strongest kind, with Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales pushing an online petition. Wales referenced the SOPA-PIPA derailment as the public's \"first big victory\" in the realm of Internet freedom, and sees preventing O'Dwyer's extradition as a potential second. To date, more than a quarter of a million people have signed the petition. But the MPAA takes a clearly different view (while reassuring all that they are pro-Internet freedom).\n\n\"This case isn't about Internet freedom. It's about a man profiting from theft. However, we do welcome a larger discussion about how best to protect intellectual property online while ensuring an Internet that works for everyone.\"\n\nIn addition to some initial talking points, the memo contains a faux-Q&A to keep commentary along the party lines. These responses run the gamut from thoughts on the Wales petition (\"We think it's presumptuous of Mr. Wales to claim to speak for the 'general public'\") to the extradition itself (\"Governments and law enforcement agencies make these decisions and we are not in a position to comment on the specifics of the extradition proceedings\").\n\nWe will update this post if any additional information from the MPAA becomes available, and we'll continue to follow the O'Dwyer situation."}
{"text": "Imagine a little while from now RedMart is closing in fast on delivering its 1 millionth order. The marketing team decides to give the customer who makes that order a prize as a gesture of appreciation. The prize is a fun one: the lucky customer gets a RedMart delivery tote and 1 hour in the warehouse. Use the hour to fill up the tote with any products you desire and take them home for free.\n\nThe only restrictions are:\n\nYou can only take 1 of any product.\n\nEverything you take, together, must completely fit into a tote.\n\nThe tote's usable space is 45 centimeters long, 30 wide and 35 high. (You can assume that if the products fit into the tote both individually and together by total volume, that you'll be able to find a way to pack them in.)\n\nHere is what a tote looks like:\n\n\nIn a stunning turn of events you are the person who places the 1 millionth RedMart order and are the winning customer. Congratulations, what luck! Your run of luck continues when you come into possession of a file describing RedMart's products. For each product it lists the price, length, width, height and weight. Being a software engineer you are quite analytical and clever. So naturally you decide to optimize this opportunity by figuring out ahead of time what products you will take, and then spend your hour leisurely collecting them around the warehouse.\n\nIn addition to the rules of the contest your personal preferences are:\n\nMaximize the dollar value of the products in the tote.\n\nA lighter tote is better, as long as you don't sacrifice any dollar value.\n\nYour challenge is to write a program in your favorite programming language to enact your plan. Use this file as input. It contains 20,000 products, one per line. Each line has the following fields separated by a comma:\n\nproduct ID, price, length, width, height, weight\n\nPrice is in cents, dimensions are in centimeters, weight is in grams.\n\nSend your code or a github link (and a resume if you like) to [?????? at redmart dot com], replacing \"??????\" with the sum of product IDs of all the products you will take. So if you take just two products, with IDs 111111 and 222222, the email address would be [333333 at redmart dot com]. If your e-mail gets through - you got the right answer.\n\nGood luck and have fun!"}

(KTVU) – A man armed with a knife was fatally shot by Sunnyvale Department of Public Safety officers Wednesday as he attempted to rob a liquor store, authorities said.\n\nThe incident happened just before lunchtime in a busy strip mall at Tasman Drive near the Lawrence Expressway.\n\nInvestigators in Sunnyvale said in the moments after an armed robbery at this liquor store, an officer found the suspect in a back alleyway.\n\nPolice scanners captured what happened next.\n\n\"Take your hand out of your pocket,\" the officer can be heard saying.\n\nThen minutes later, \"He's refusing to comply, he has the knife. He's about 50 feet away, he's standing still.\"\n\nThen the officer says, \"He's walking towards me. Put the knife down!\"\n\nAnd finally: \"Shots fired. Suspect is down.\"\n\n.\n\nWitness Alvaro Camilo was on his lunch break when he saw the shooting happen.\n\n\"The guy was just standing, standing holding a knife. And we just heard the officer screaming at him, put the knife down cause he wouldn't listen. He went towards him with the knife. That's when they shot him,\" said Camilo.\n\n\"By the time we went back out there, after the shots were done, went out there and saw police on top of the suspect and he already looked gone,\" said Dave Palmer, another witness.\n\nThe suspect, a white male in his mid-20s, was transported to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\n\nInvestigators recovered the knife at the scene.\n\n\"We always conduct a thorough investigation any time we have an officer involved incident. So that's always been our practice and continues to be our practice,\" said Deputy Chief Dave Pitts of the Sunnyvale Department of Public Safety.\n\nCamilo told he recorded the whole thing on his cell phone, but police took it.\n\n\"Yeah we have a video but they needed it for their investigations,\" says Camilo.\n\nAuthorities said they'll review it, along with any video that may come from inside the liquor store.\n\n\"With any investigation we want the truth. So if video evidence helps us get to the truth in exactly what occured, that's a good thing,\" says Deputy Chief Pitts.\n\nThe officer has been placed on routine paid administrative leave. Both Sunnyvale and the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office will conduct investigations."}

In addition, she said the principal never told her Wong was on leave saying, \"all actions regarding personnel matters are confidential.\"\n\n\"You guys send us news letters about kids having head lice, you guys send us news letters about suspicious vehicles. Yet when it's actually an employee that's at the actual school with a child, we don't have the right to know, that makes no sense whatsoever,\" she said.\n\nThe woman is confident Wong never touched her son, but did file a harassment complaint against him.\n\n\"In our point of view, it was more like the grooming process. Fortunately for us, we caught it earlier, in time, but it was definitely progressing,\" she said.\n\nCourt records show Wong did not dispute the request for the TRO.

{"text": "On Monday, Fox News Analyst, Ralph Peters boldly declared that the death penalty should be brought back for NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. Last week, the 29 year old leaked a host of documents to The Guardian depicting the NSA's massive spy apparatus in the United States. This comes during the first week of Bradley Manning's trial.\n\nOn Fox and Friends, Peters makes a rhetorical statement regarding the NSA's secret metadata gathering program and the PRISM program, \"Show me one law abiding citizen which has been hurt by this program?\" The answer clearly is none, now the question that someone should ask Mr. Peters is how many American citizens have been hurt by the leaks of Manning or Snowden? The answer, too, would be none. Peters continues on by asserting that committing treason has become cool and Snowden has become the Kim Kardashian of leaks.\n\nAsserting that whistleblowers should receive the death penalty contradicts international law and America's supposed dedication to transparency. There is a difference between an individual who leaks information and a whistleblower. A whistleblower's mission revolves around justice and righting wrongs he or she perceives the government is taking part in. Leakers are self-interested and usually the information leaked doesn't lead to severe scrutiny. We can use two famous examples, Bradley Manning whistle blowing by releasing millions of documents depicting a plethora of war crimes compared to the premeditated leaking of President Obama's \"kill list.\"\n\nFor Mr. Peters to assert that Snowden and Manning are committing acts of treason is terrifying. These individuals had access to the most delicate information and chose to release them to media outlets instead of given them to foreign enemies or spies. They could've received plenty of money for the amount of information that was at their fingertips. Peters needs to understand the definition of treason. Treason is defined as the offense of acting to overthrow one's government or to harm or kill its sovereign. By this definition Snowden didn't even come close to treason.\n\nTo close out this Fox and Friends segment the announcer smugly says that Snowden is thinking of defecting to Iceland or China. Defecting would require Snowden to renounce his citizenship to the United States and pledge allegiance to any of these two countries. Instead he most like will be seeking political asylum because Iceland has a long history and respect for freedom of speech and information. Fox News strikes out again when it comes to fear mongering and inaccurate reporting.\n\nHere's the video:\n\nRelated article: NSA Whistleblower Is Revealed, Flees To China As News Of DoJ Investigation Announced (VIDEO)"}

You can see a video explaining the new research here at Space.com.\n\n\"After two decades of hunting for exoplanets, we are finally beginning to see long-period gas giant planets similar to those in our own solar system,\" said lead author Megan Bedell, a graduate student in astrophysics at the University of Chicago, in a statement.\n\n\"This discovery is, in every respect, an exciting sign that other solar systems [like our own] may be out there waiting to be discovered.\"\n\nExtrasolar gas giants are a common find, but what makes HIP 11915 interesting is how far away it is from its parent star. Current methods of planet-hunting – such as detecting the effect on a star – favor finding big planets close to small dwarf stars. According to the release from ESO, this newly discovered system is the \"most accurate analogue yet found for the Sun and Jupiter.\"\n\nThis find could be a help to predicting where life arises in extrasolar systems, the team added. In our own solar system, the theory goes, the massive size of Jupiter acted as an influence on how the smaller planets around it were arranged.\n\nSince at least one of those planets (Earth) hosts life, Jupiter could be considered a life-friendly asset to our solar system. However, Jupiter is also believed to have directed many comets and asteroids toward the sun early in the solar system's formation, which could have upped the chances for cosmic smashups a few billion years ago.\n\nThe discovery of HIP 11915 was made with HARPS, a planet-hunting instrument on the European Southern Observatory's 3.6-meter telescope at La Silla Observatory in Chile. Scientists said follow-up observations will be necessary to confirm the find.\n\nThe research will be published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics.\n\nFollow Elizabeth Howell @howellspace.

It's the worst anti-privacy law since the USA PATRIOT Act, and we should repeal it as soon as possible.\"\n\nAmash introduced the repeal bill along with Reps. John Conyers (D-Mich.), Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), Ted Poe (R-Texas), and Jared Polis (D-Colo.).\n\nWhile the law \"includes information that directs companies to scrub information, companies are only directed to scrub personal information if they actually have affirmative evidence that the information is not relevant to a cyber threat,\" Polis told FCW on Jan. 14. \"That's an unrealistic impossible standard because you are asking the company to prove something that doesn't exist.\"\n\nThe legislation increases information sharing between the government and the private sector, something that has always been controversial among privacy groups.\n\nPolis, who sits on the Rules Committee, said the Cybersecurity Act of 2015 was \"sneaked\" into the omnibus along with four to five provisions that had previously passed in the House. He argued that the law's provisions would not have prevented any of the recent high-profile cyber-attacks, such as the Office of Personnel Management breach and the Sony hack. Those incidents, he said, were possible because the people in charge of managing the cyber networks failed to use best practices on cybersecurity.\n\nAnd with the current components of the bill, Polis said, information would be shared with agencies such as the NSA and DHS who \"time and time again\" have broken privacy rules and overstepped legal authorities. \"I have no reason to believe they will abide by the privacy protections of this bill either,\" he said.\n\nPolis said he expects there to be support for the bill to repeal this legislation, but it may not pass as a piece of standalone legislation.\n\n\"It might take the form of appropriation amendments or other vehicles that are available for us,\" he predicted."}

The only group not celebrating \"Comey week,\" Noah said, is the Trump administration, as the president's administration tries to push \"infrastructure week.\"\n\n\"They're trying to distract from the most exciting political story, but they're doing it with the most boring topic of all. 'Infrastructure week,' really? It's like if a TV channel said, 'How can we steal viewers from Shark Week? Oh I know, Barnacle Week,'\" said Noah.\n\nNoah joked that streets and roads are important, because how else will Comey get to his hearing to testify? He moved on to mock Trump's small portable desk and recent air traffic control ceremony, where he signed a document that appeared to be a bill but wasn't.\n\n\"Hate him or love him you've gotta admit Trump looks really cute when he signs things at that little desk.\" Noah thinks it looks like a high chair, and he said he's waiting for Trump to flip over the page and color in the mermaid drawing on the back. He said he was impressed by Trump's recent executive order signing — until he discovered it was actually just a memo to Congress.\n\n\"What the hell people? He just wrote a to-do list and signed it? He really is a TV president,\" said Noah. He called it a recurring theme of Trump's presidency. \"He loves the performance of doing things. But a lot of the time, nothing's actually being done. Essentially, Donald Trump wants to be president, but he doesn't want to do president.\"\n\nThe Daily Show host detailed how many of Trump's deals aren't actually deals at all, using a graphic to describe it as \"No Content for Old Man.\" \"I don't know about you, but I think it's time we take action and crack down on these phony claims,\" Noah added.\n\nNoah brought out his own \"tiny desk for doing stuff\" and shouted \"No more lies.\" He signed a piece of paper with a massively large pencil and said, \"It's done, no more lies.\""}
{"text": "This deck is amazing. Reached rank 3 with it, and it has reached legend in the past. Great, cheap deck that almost anybody can create, also really fun!\n\nMulligan:\n\nFiery War Axe, Acolyte of Pain, Mad Bomber, Loot Hoarder, Ravaging Ghoul\n\nAlternatively, Gnomish Inventor and Bloodhoof Brave can be kept depending on your curve and opponent.\n\nStrategy:\n\nEarly game:\n\nYou want to draw as many cards as you can! Also, keep yourself alive! You can afford to be aggressive with this deck a lot of the time by slapping their face with some of your many early minions to knock their health down, because once they are at 20 points of health you can win at any moment! Of course there are times where you have to trade, this all depends on your hand and opponent. Kor'kron Elite is effective for punching down their health to put them in combo range. Bloodhoof Brave is good for stalling out the game. Save Execute for removing taunts or large threats. Especially taunts as they will completely counter your win condition. Try to use Battle Rage to draw at least 2 or 3 cards, as this will give you a huge swing in ability and greatly increase your chances of winning.\n\nThe win:\n\nThe cards you need to win the game are Charge, Raging Worgen and a combination of one or two (max two or else the worgen dies) Cruel Taskmaster and Inner Rage. Yea, its that simple. Some things to keep in mind: Charge + Worgen + 1 activator = 16 damage. With 2 activators, its 20 damage, which is the maximum this combo can do.\n\nOther cards that are good in this deck:\n\nRampage, Frothing Berserker, Mortal Strike, Abusive Sergeant, even Grommash Hellscream\n\nDespite these good replacements i prefer the original decklist. It may seem that getting a bigger combo is better but the 16 or 20 damage is often enough to finish your opponent, especially with the other instant-damage cards you have like Kor'kron Elite and Fiery War Axe, its not too difficult to push your opponent into combo range.\n\nThe beauty of this deck is how cheap and simple it is. Really good deck for beginners as it teaches you the mechanics of hearthstone, and how to play a specific decktype. Very fun and satisfying wins! Good luck"}

I am born and raised in Ontario, Canada and no, you don't get used to the winters, at least I haven't yet in my thirty something winters here!\n\n\nI have always had a magnetic pull towards creative endeavors. My earliest activities were drawing, sculpting (horrendously) and painting whatever I could. At the age of 6 or 7 I decided that my father was completely wasting his tool shed with such nonsense as lawnmowers and gardening tools, and took it upon myself to take over and make it my painting studio.\n\n\nLet me tell you, it was hot as hell in that little wooden shed at the back of our yard, but I was determined to make my art and my dad didn't complain, in fact he was my very first customer, and still has the misshapen, heat stroke induced portrait of our family dog somewhere.\n\n\nI went to school for photography, and while that is still a major passion and hobby for me, I quickly realized that I didn't have the drive or will to deal with the horrors of wedding photography and the like, and that my resting bitch face wasn't helping the situation any.\n\n\nI spent a lot of years making my art for friends and family, or mostly just for my own amusement. I toyed with the idea of selling on Etsy for YEARS. Once I began to create things for my shop I found that I could not stop. The ideas are streaming in almost constantly and I have since branched out into soaps, bath products etc, which was a whole new art form for me and something that I am finding to be immensely satisfying. Soap making is like art and science rolled into one and the possibility for creation is endless!\n\n\nAnother passion I picked up in the last couple years has been Pyrography or \"wood burning\" and it quickly became not only an obsession, but the most sought after art I have ever created!\n\n\nI have no doubt in my mind that creating and expanding my artistic horizons will only continue on and on, thus my little shop has become something of a \"general store\" featuring plenty of different items and products, and as much as online advice tells us to stick to one item per store, this works for me and I love the variety!\n\n\nI hope you will enjoy scrolling through and will come back often if only to see what this mad girls mind has concocted next!\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nJen"}

The plane may also someday have the capability to fly as a drone.\n\n\nThe Pentagon says it needs the new warplane to replace its aging fleet of B-1 bombers, which were designed in the 1970s, and even older B-52s.\n\n\n\"Today, it's vital to innovate and reinvest in the people, strategies and technologies that will allow America's military to be dominant in the second aerospace century,\" Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said Tuesday as the contract was announced.\n\n\nThe contract has two parts. In the first phase, Northrop will receive more than $20 billion to develop the bomber.\n\n\nThe company would then be paid $550 million to build each plane — an award that could reach $60 billion.\n\n\nCritics say the cost of the contract is bound to skyrocket, similar to what happened when Northrop built the B-2 bomber in the 1980s.\n\n\nThat contract was so far over budget that the Pentagon decided to build just 21 of the 132 aircraft it had originally planned. The average cost of each B-2 soared to more than $2 billion.\n\n\nMany experts also question why the Pentagon even needs a new bomber. The Air Force is already spending billions of dollars to modernize its current fleet of 150 bombers, readying them for the next 25 to 50 years.\n\n\nBut such skepticism is hard to find in the Antelope Valley, which still hasn't fully recovered from the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n\nBoth Palmdale and the neighboring city of Lancaster have suffered in the last couple of decades as aerospace firms moved jobs out of California to states where wages and other costs are lower.\n\n\nRobert Kleinhenz, chief economist of the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp., said the county currently has about 38,000 aerospace jobs — about 8% of the nation's total.\n\n\nThat is down 70% from 25 years ago when the county had 130,000 aerospace jobs, or more than 15% of the nation's total.\n\n\nThe bomber contract could increase jobs across Southern California, Kleinhenz said, especially benefiting dozens of smaller companies that supply the major aerospace firms.\n\n\nSaid Lancaster Mayor R.

The project may also pave the way for better therapies to address infertility.\n\n\"I am delighted that the HFEA has approved Dr. Niakan's application,\" says Crick director Paul Nurse.\n\nThe embryos to be used for the project will be donated by patients after giving informed consent. These patients are those who undergo IVF treatments and the eggs to be used are excess of those treatments.\n\nUnder the HEFA regulation, any of the donated embryos will only be used for the purpose of research. None of the embryos cannot be utilized for any type of treatment.\n\n\"I think this will be a good example to countries who are considering their approach to regulating this technology,\" says Sarah Chan from the University of Edinburgh.

Researchers from all over the world will now have the confidence to apply to the concerned regulatory bodies in their countries if there are, or just start and make a move.\n\nChan suggests having a regulated system that will put a distinct line between research and reproduction.\n\nThe researchers are just waiting for ethical approval.

{"text": "1 SHARES Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Pinterest Print Mail Flipboard\n\nIt's the War of the Roses and Greg Abbott's new tactic is to stop hiding that his office doesn't pay women equally. Now he's just coming out with it — doubling down on misogyny. After Greg Abbott (R-TX) was busted for claiming to support equal pay but paying the women in his office less than men for the same jobs, he finally admitted that he would veto equal pay in Texas.\n\nShortly after the brush fire of pay inequity within his own AG office came to light, the Dallas News reported Wednesday, \"Abbott's campaign told the Associated Press that he would have vetoed the bill, also. His answer came two weeks after Abbott had declined to answer the veto question.\"\n\nTexas Republican gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbott says he would not sign a bill to make it easier for women to bring pay discrimination suits, hoping to get past an issue that has dogged his campaign for weeks.\n\nIt looks like Abbott thinks if he just admits this, we can all move past what Republicans deem to be a distraction. Meanwhile, Wendy Davis is surging in the polls and the issue of fair pay is catching fire.\n\nWhile Abbott's position is not news to those who have learned how to read between the lines, it's sort of a bold new strategy for Abbott. Up until now, he's been telling anecdotes about his wife and daughter and talking in very general terms about how much he supports equal pay. Now, instead of playing folksy family man, his new approach is he doesn't care that he is feeding right into Wendy Davis' attacks. He isn't even going to deny that he is a misogynist.\n\nThe Davis campaign just managed to back Abbott into a truth-telling corner, from which he has revealed just how out of touch he is.\n\nWendy Davis campaign spokesman Zac Petkanas noted dryly, \"On the day that Texans discover Greg Abbott pays women less than men in his office, he announces he would veto equal pay legislation that would help his employees address this discrimination. Texans are tired of business as usual from Greg Abbott and support Wendy Davis' fight on economic fairness for all hardworking Texans.\"\n\nGreg Abbott just scored a touchdown for the other team, and proved Wendy Davis right about him. And here Texas Republicans don't think women can negotiate.\n\nThey haven't really met Wendy Davis yet, apparently. But this is just like Republicans — they fight the battle they want to fight, not the battle they are in.\n\nImage: Burnt Orange"}
{"text": "If you thought the Raiders cutting Rolando McClain was good news, you're going to love this. As it turns out, according to Joel Corry of the National Football Post, there was language in McClain's contract that voided all remaining guaranteed money should he be suspended for conduct.\n\nLast season he was indeed suspended for two games for conduct detrimental to the team which means his remaining $3.635 million in previously guaranteed money is now voided. This brings his dead money against the cap from its previously assumed figure of $10.895 million down to $7.26 million - just $585k more than his 2013 cap hit would have been had he remained on the roster.\n\nBasically what this means is it the cost of cutting him is negligible compared to keeping him. But keeping him would have been far more costly to the team dynamic and you can't put a price on that. That said, actual monetary value is nice as well. In this case, for Rolando McClain, it was literally payback time.\n\nMcClain officially became a free agent on Monday at 1pm Pacific time and the Raiders immediately began putting that $3.635 million to good use. In about 24 hours time, they signed two outside free agents - CB Mike Jenkins and S Usama Young -- and re-signed two of their own free agents - DE Andre Carter and CB Joselio Hanson. They are also believed to have tendered contracts to their remaining Exclusive Rights Free Agents - CB Brandian Ross, RB Jeremy Stewart, and OL Alex Parsons.\n\nThe contract figures of the newly signed free agents are not yet known, so it is hard to know the Raiders' exact cap number at this instant. However, the most recent figure before the flurry of signings on Monday and Tuesday at about $8 million under the salary cap.\n\nYou can figure the four signings carry a total cap hit between $3 million and $4 million which would leave the team with enough room to sign one or perhaps two more low cost free agents. If they do add a player or more than one, it would happen this week as off-season workouts begin next Monday. Free Agent quarterback Seneca Wallace is visiting on Wednesday and there is a decent chance the Raiders attempt to sign him to a minimum deal which would give the team three quarterbacks.\n\nThe cap room will open up again for the Raiders once June 1rolls around and the a large portion of Michael Huff's cap hit is distributed to 2014. We can expect more additions at that time.\n\nFollow @LeviDamien"}

The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Republican Mike Enzi of Wyoming, chose to focus on how repeal would effect economic growth:\n\n\"'CBO has determined what many in Congress have known all along,' said Chairman Enzi. 'This law acts as an anchor on our economy by dragging down employment and reducing labor force participation. As a result, the deficit reduction that the Democrats promised when it was enacted is substantially unclear.'\"\n\nDemocrats put their focus on the negative impacts of repeal. House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi said:\n\n\"The cost to the deficit would be surpassed only by the human toll of repeal. Republicans would add over 20 million Americans to the ranks of the uninsured, and strip vital health protections from hundreds of millions of American families – shattering the newfound health security that has made a difference in the lives of so many families. Republicans should look at the numbers and finally end their fixation with repealing this historic law.\"\n\nThe new CBO report incorporates the principles of dynamic scoring, which takes into account a wider array of economic factors, and which Republicans say provides a more realistic picture of the economic impact of repeal. The CBO says under the old rules, the deficit would increase even more, by $353 billion over ten years.\n\nPolitico says the CBO report could have political implications:\n\n\"The estimate will make it harder for Republicans to use so-called reconciliation to repeal the law because congressional budgeting rules bar lawmakers from using the parliamentary maneuver to move legislation that adds to government red ink.\n\nThe CBO report said over the long term, repeal would add even more to the deficit:"}
{"text": "An Emory College German Studies professor has received a national award for her debut book examining the evolution of protagonists in modern Yiddish literature.\n\nMiriam Udel, associate professor of Yiddish language, literature and culture, and director of graduate studies at the Tam Institute for Jewish Studies, has won the National Jewish Book Award in Modern Jewish Thought and Experience for her work, Never Better! The Modern Jewish Picaresque.\n\nUdel, who grew up in the Miami area, graduated from Miami-Palmetto High School.\n\nHer book examines Yiddish fiction as it grew out of the Jewish enlightenment of the 18th and 19th centuries — which, like broader literature, was concerned with the repair and improvement of readers — and into a genre less driven by change.\n\nThe title gestures at the comic spirit of one of the authors she writes about, Sholem Aleichem. His characters might have answered the question, \"How are you?\" with a cheerful, \"Never better!\" even as they feared life might not actually get better.\n\nThe genre therefore embraces the Jewish role of outsider or person living at the margins of community. In that way, literature has been a response to the marginalization of Jews and Jewish aspiration, Udel said.\n\n\"To have it win in a category other than scholarship tells me that this book has something real to contribute to the conversation about modern Jewish thought,\" Udel said. \"I believe it has the potential to shape what we talk about and how we discuss issues.\"\n\nThe Jewish Book Council honored Udel and other award winners at a ceremony in March at the Center for Jewish History in New York City. The council began recognizing authors through its awards program in 1950.\n\nHiram Maxim, chair of the Emory German Studies department, is proud of the Udel's award and its timing, coming during her second year of a deep dive with Emory colleagues into the often overlooked body of 20th Century Yiddish children's literature published between and immediately after World Wars I and II.\n\n\"The award is a wonderful affirmation of Dr. Udel's outstanding contribution to the scholarship on modernist Jewish literature, and the department is already excited about her next book project on Yiddish children's literature, a topic that she is exploring this semester in a jointly taught course with Dr. Marshall Duke from the psychology department,\" Maxim said.\n\nUdel said she also collaborated with her husband, Adam Zachary Newton, a distinguished visiting professor at the Fox Center for Humanistic Inquiry, on her debut book."}

's review\n\nI read this book while hang-gliding over the coast of Liechtenstein. It was difficult to grip the jacket of the book, not only because I was airborne, but because the night before I was in Moscow having vodka and gasoline with Luis San Baptista Rodolfo Sr., a ex-foot soldier for the Revolutionary FALN, and my head was POUNDING! I told Luis over a dinner (red cabbage over braised Skeletor Dolls) I had never seen the last episode of Family Ties, and he instantly grew furious, and cried out, \"Matushka! Matushka! My cauliflower is on fire!\" and thrust a copy of \"Waiting for Godot\" into my pocket, and whispered into my big toe, \"Listen, my friend, I only have a credit card, so I put on my visa and you give me cash, no?\"\n\n\nI immediately understood Luis' implicit instructions: the only proper way to read Beckett truly, to feel the power of his words, is to do so while manning non-mechanical aircraft.\n\n\nAt first I found Beckett's dramatic universe too glib, even watery, like a Burmese jungle cat. I found the dialogue too reliant upon the use of words. I thought the use of characters instead of sandwiches or tuxedos was trite and derivative. I also found the verdant pastures of Liechtenstein simply enchanting from an aerial point of view. Several times, I found myself questioning my decision to question my decision to use McDonald's wrappers from the Basque Region for the material of my hang-glider's wings, but then I realized, that's the point: having no discernible narrative thru-line is STILL a narrative thru-line all the same. Beckett's brilliance touched me at last. (But without permission, so I'm suing him in the Hague.)\n\n\nSo, I'm giving this a 5. Not a strong five. But not a weak five either. The sort of 5 that actively worked out for the high school rugby team, but then spent college taking it easy, drinking Irish Car Bombs, and now, years later plays Ultimate Frisbee on the weekends and sometimes runs in Central Park in the evenings, if not doing Bikram Yoga in Soho."}

During the mayhem, the 24-year-old store clerk ushered the terrified patrons to safety by hiding them in the supermarket's basement freezer. Upstairs, jihadist Amedy Coulibaly, who claimed to be affiliated with ISIS, was armed with AK-47s and explosives. He held 15 hostages and, by the time the hours-long ordeal was over, had killed four.\n\nIn an interview with French TV station BFMTV, Bethily described the nightmarish scenario: \"I went down to the freezer, I opened the door, there were several people who went in with me. I turned off the light and the freezer.\" Upstairs, Coulibaly was threatening to kill hostages if police raided the printing plant where the Charlie Hebdo killers (and suspected co-conspirators) Cherif and Said Kouachi were holed up. \"I brought them inside and I told them to stay calm here, I'm going to go out,\" said Bethily. \"When they got out, they thanked me.\" The police weren't so kind at first; Bethily describes being handcuffed for an hour and a half because cops assumed he was one of the terrorists.\n\nBy the time it was all over, Coulibably and the Koachi brothers were dead, shot by security forces in simultaneous raids on the supermarket and the printing plant. The following day, the French newspaper L'Express ran the headline \"Lassana Bathily, \"Malian Muslim' hero of the hostage situation in Vincennes\" as many on social media lauded the young man as a hero.\n\nOf course, treating Muslims like human beings isn't for everyone, as bigoted fossil Rupert Murdoch proved when tweeted this: \"Maybe most Moslems peaceful, but until they recognize and destroy their growing jihadist cancer they must be held responsible.\" Murdoch evidently thinks the actions of three violent maniacs should be attributed to the world's 1.6 billion Muslims – a number that includes Bathily.\n\nOn Saturday, Bathily gave an interview to BFMTV in which he made a simple plea for coexistence: \"We are brothers. It's not a question of Jews, of Christians or of Muslims. We're all in the same boat, we have to help each other to get out of this crisis.\" At a time when religiously motivated violence shows no sign of abating, it's a far more enlightened sentiment than Murdoch appears capable of."}

The notebook is interesting, it is cartoon is style so it looks like the smaller book opens but really it is one big book, and it doesn't have any cardboard backing along the spine. The notebook seems sturdy enough but I probably wouldn't suggest it for heavy usage projects instead just to jot notes in or doodle in due to the way the spine is, the notebook came with a cute paper ruler (no measurements included, this is to help line the paper if needed). The pen writes very well, it is smooth and it keeps the lettering small which is perfect for my weekly reminder binder so this pen has actually been moved to my purse so I can use it on a daily basis. The flake stickers were pretty cute, the backings are easy to get off and the coloring is great.

{"text": "Think Progress has really been all over the Florida voter purge story, finally driving the kind of attention to the issue that it deserves. It's really a case of a political party trying to steal an election in plain sight. When you see the head of the Florida Republican Party admit on national television that the purge is based on flawed data, but also that it must continue, you know that the ulterior motives are clear.\n\nAs mentioned, Think Progress' coverage has led to news outlets finally paying attention to what's happening in Florida, including Ari Berman at Rolling Stone. And at least one elections supervisor, in Palm Beach County, has rejected the voter purge list citing the high error rates associates with their generation, and will not be sending out notices to voters that their rights can be taken away if they don't prove their citizenship within 30 days. According to the supervisor, the purge lists are \"not credible.\"\n\nAmidst all this, voting rights activists surveying the scene in Florida got some additional good news. A federal judge today blocked a separate Florida voter suppression law, which is designed to make voter registration drives more difficult.\n\nA federal judge blocked enforcement of key provisions of a restrictive voting law in Florida today, a breakthrough victory for Florida voters and voting rights advocates nationwide. The law, H.B. 1355, included onerous restrictions on community-based voter registration drives, forcing the League of Women Voters of Florida and other groups to shut down their drives. In his decision, U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle found that the Constitution and federal law prohibit most of Florida's recently-passed restrictions, and highlighted the law's impact on the Plaintiffs' constitutional rights. \"Together speech and voting are constitutional rights of special significance; they are the rights most protective of all others, joined in this respect by the ability to vindicate one's rights in a federal court. … [W]hen a plaintiff loses an opportunity to register a voter, the opportunity is gone forever,\" U.S. Judge Robert L. Hinkle wrote in his opinion blocking most of the Florida law. \"And allowing responsible organizations to conduct voter-registration drives—thus making it easier for citizens to register and vote—promotes democracy.\"\n\nFlorida passed the law in order to crack down on voter fraud, a virtually non-existent practice.\n\nThis ruling will have no bearing on the voter purge, though it does show the lengths to which Rick Scott and Florida Republicans are willing to go to guarantee an election for their side. As for the voter purge, activists will continue to track the efforts throughout the state."}

{"text": "One day the world will wake up and give the correct amount of attention to what religious leaders have to say. While this dream doesn't come true it is cause for celebration when one of them publishes something that does not occur just inside of their own head.\n\nThis Thursday his holiness the Pope issued a memo to all his VPs (AKA bishops) containing his thoughts on the problem of global warming. Instead of blaming us humans in it for pissing off God — which in turn would force Him to punish us with more and more waves of heat—, Pope Francis took the sensible road and said it as it is:\n\n\"Humanity is called to take conscience of the necessity of changes in lifestyles, of production and of consumption, to combat this [global] warming, or at least the human causes that produce it or accelerate it.\"\n\nFor the first time since I started trying to ignore what popes say on press releases one statement has caught my attention. Of course Pope Francis had already expressed positive views on gay acceptance, the fight on poverty and football — which are all problems worth discussing —, but never in a way that was this official.\n\nThe Pope's views in a document like the encyclical function as the Catholic Church's positioning on the subject. He's the CEO, after all. Now during masses priest can talk (openly) about our individual contribution towards the Apocalypse, which can be effective in a large scale. Recycling and using renewable energy might become gateways to heaven too.\n\n\"The earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth.\" — Pope Francis\n\nAnother good thing about the encyclical is that it opened the door so other denominations could also make their position on global warming clear. Imam Mohamed Magid of the Islamic Society of North America, for example, said to TIME Magazine that \"people of all faiths can come together for this cause because the concept of stewardship on Earth is a shared belief.\" A proof, thus, that a bit of sensibleness can bring people of so distinct creeds together.\n\nWhatever the Pope says still resonates strongly around the world. It is more effective in all senses, then, to talk about real issues than about the deathly sin that is the use of contraceptive methods. Religion should be a comforting and educating experience, not a constant struggle to revalidate beaten dogmas. This man Jorge Mario seems wise enough to understand he can only do good to people if people listen to him — so he's adapting.\n\nThis Pope is pop."}
{"text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China's demand for minor metals used in renewable fuels and electric vehicles will continue to rise over the next four years, as consumption of base metals slows, the government said in the latest update of its five-year industry plan.\n\nDemand for zinc, used in construction and infrastructure to protect steel from rusting, could even hit a peak by end-2020, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) said in a statement released late Tuesday.\n\nBeijing's latest iteration of its plan for the non-ferrous industry to 2020 underscored how metals use is shifting from major base metals that have fueled global metals markets and gone into building the world's second-largest economy over the past decade.\n\nAs non-ferrous metals demand growth slows to a \"medium-to-slow speed\", niche, high value metals like cobalt, lithium and magnesium used in electric vehicles, lightweight cars and planes, clean energy and the electronics industry will drive consumption over the coming four years, the government said.\n\nThe aluminum sector in particular has become bloated in the past few years as smelting output in the world's top producer has surged, forcing Beijing to take measures to curb excess.\n\nEven so, the MIIT said it expects base metals output will grow over the coming four years even as it strictly controls expansion of new capacity.\n\nThe ministry said again it will encourage continued consolidation and boost proven ore reserves by 2020, and increased its target for curbing emissions from sulfur dioxide by 15 percent, up from 10 percent over the previous five years.\n\nThe government set output targets for key metals as shown in the below table.\n\n(Numbers are in million tonnes except for gold which is in tonnes.

{"text": "Red Bulls Coach Jesse Marsch during the team's 0-0 draw on Saturday. Photograph by Matt Kremkau\n\nBy RYAN BRISTER\n\nThe fourth weekend of the Major League Soccer season was limited to three games, with most of the league off for FIFA international dates. Two were high scoring, one ended 0-0. Still, there were lessons to be learned from Week 4.\n\nRed Bulls Marsch Critical of Schedule\n\nNew York was one of only six MLS teams in action. Both the Red Bulls (Sacha Kljestan) and Real Salt Lake (Nick Rimando and Alberto Rusnak) had players away on national team duty. New York Coach Jesse Marsch was not a big fan of playing on during the break:\n\n\"I don't like it. I don't understand it. These are things to ask the league. There's often things that I don't quite get. But in the end, it's O.K. because it gives us a rhythm right now of playing games, but, yeah, I'd much rather have both teams be able to have their full complement of players.\"\n\nMatt Van Oekel Is Ready for MLS\n\nAfter winning the Golden Glove award as the best keeper in the North American Soccer League last year, Matt Van Oekel moved from FC Edmonton and took a job as Nick Rimando's backup at Real Salt Lake. With Rimando away with the United States national team for World Cup qualifying, Van Oekel made his first start for Salt Lake on Saturday, and impressed with three saves against the Red Bulls. His shutout was matched by Luis Robles in a scoreless draw.\n\nMinnesota's Defense Is Dreadful\n\nWith 17 goals allowed in their first four games, Minnesota United is on pace to shatter the MLS record for defensive futility in a season (Colorado allowed 69 in 32 games in 1998) . The Loons allowed five goals, including two penalties, in their loss to New England on Saturday. Goalkeeper Bobby Shuttleworth's return to Foxborough after eight years with the Revs was unpleasant, to say the least.\n\nColumbus Can Compete With the Best\n\nColumbus made a statement with its win over Portland, which had a perfect record through three weeks. The Crew fell behind early, but showed some of the firepower that led them on their MLS Cup run in 2015. This was a replay of that year's title match, the first time the Timbers have visited since, and the atmosphere at Mapfre Stadium was something more than a typical game in March."}

{"text": "\"Smoke disappears and fire hotspots become clearly visible\"\n\nWorldView-3, the newest addition to the DigitalGlobe constellation, will enable our customers to see the world in new ways. Not only does it offer the highest resolution in the industry, as you saw in our first imagery blog post, but the satellite also carries a shortwave infrared (SWIR) sensor, built by Exelis, that will unlock information and insight in new ways.\n\nOne of the amazing things that SWIR enables is the ability to see through the dense smoke of an active fire to the ground beneath, as well as locating the flame front and hot spots in the fire. We used WorldView-3 to image a forest fire burning at the Happy Camp complex in California's Klamath National Forest last week. The image on the left is what you see in the visible part of the spectrum, which is what a standard commercial imaging satellite would see. The smoke completely obscures the ground.\n\nMove the slider to see the image on the right, and uncover what can be seen with SWIR imagery: the smoke disappears, and the hot spots in the fire become clearly visible. Both of these are overview images that show the full extent of the fire and are not at full resolution. The SWIR image is a \"false color\" composite made from three of the eight SWIR bands (bands 6, 3, and 1) that coincidentally give an orange color to the fire.\n\n[iframe src=\"http://www.digitalglobe.com/interactive/swir/\" width=\"100%\" height=\"650″]\n\n\nHere is a further zoom around the burn area:\n\nThe SWIR bands penetrate smoke to differing degrees. SWIR band 8 has the best smoke penetration; here is a zoomed in shot of the fire line in which no smoke is visible:\n\nBut it gets even better. Not only does SWIR see through smoke and detect hot spots, but it can even give an estimate of where the fire is burning the hottest. The last image is a relative temperature \"heat map\" calculated by looking at all eight SWIR spectral bands (colors) carried on WorldView-3, showing where the fire is most intense.\n\nWe are looking forward to providing this new capability to firefighters and emergency responders around the globe as we help them to save lives and resources – yet another example of how DigitalGlobe fulfills its purpose of Seeing a Better World™.\n\nWatch this space for more examples of how WorldView-3 sees the world clearly and in new ways!"}
{"text": "Letters of Recommendation\n\nLetters of recommendation are an important part of your application to medical school. Medical schools rely on letters of recommendation to learn about important aspects of your potential as a medical student that they cannot glean from your GPA and MCAT score: in particular, your communication skills, interpersonal skills, and intellectual curiosity.\n\nIt is essential that you develop good relationships with some of your professors if you want to obtain strong letters of recommendation. Ask questions in class, go talk with them during their office hours, and ask them about their research interests. Developing relationships with your professors is an important part of your intellectual growth. If you have learned a lot from a professor and enjoyed his or her teaching style, consider taking a second class with the same professor. Doing so will provide you an opportunity to learn more, get to know the professor even better, and perhaps obtain an even stronger letter of recommendation.\n\nMost medical schools require a minimum of three letters of recommendation. The IU School of Medicine requires one science faculty recommendation (from a biology, chemistry, or physics instructor), one non-science faculty recommendation, and one personal recommendation. Some medical schools require two letters from science professors. A suggested plan would be to obtain three faculty letters of recommendation (one nonscience and two science) and one personal letter of recommendation, plus any additional letters from faculty who know you well. Often an applicant's file can be strengthened by including letters from professors in small humanities and social science classes, because in these classes professors often get to know you better and learn more about your critical thinking skills through frequent interaction in class discussions, and reading the papers you have written.\n\nChoose your recommenders wisely and request recommendations from them early. Open an Interfolio file for your letters of recommendation by your sophomore year. Most applicants rely more heavily on letters of recommendation from their advanced-level coursework, but if during your freshman or sophomore year you have taken a course in which you have excelled and gotten to know the professor well you should consider obtaining a letter from the professor at that time.\n\nAsk your professors for recommendations soon after completing the class, rather than months later when they may have forgotten about you. Remember that your professors will be reflecting on your maturity and professionalism in their evaluation of you. Give all your recommenders a detailed statement about yourself and a resume to help them write a more effective letter. Once a professor has agreed to write a recommendation for you, show professional courtesy to them and exercise patience by allowing them reasonable time to submit the letter.\n\nFor more advice on navigating the letter of recommendation process, please click here."}

{"text": "Turning down the thermostat may not only help you save on your heating bill, it also could be the secret to losing weight.\n\nResearch published last year in the journal Cell Metabolism compared the calorie burn in subjects as they exercised in a 65 degree lab and then lay down on a bed chilled to 53 degrees until they started shivering.\n\nIn both tests, the subjects produced a hormone called irisin that converted sluggish white fat cells designed to store body fat into metabolically active brown fat cells designed to rev up calorie burn. Shivering muscles released another hormone, FGF21, that further boosted calorie burn.\n\nAround 50 grams of brown fat burned an additional 300 calories daily, the study found. That's about the same as a 30-minute jog, according the Compendium of Physical Activity.\n\n\"This is most likely not a permanent change but it can produce some weight loss,\" said Ajay Chawla, a brown fat researcher with the University of California, San Francisco who was not involved with the study.\n\nBabies are born with vast amounts of brown fat distributed over their bodies that melts away as they grow, Chawla said. In response to cold, adults may make another kind of brown fat, known as \"beige brown fat,\" that has been shown to reverse obesity in mice.\n\n\"Most of us are not under much thermal stress, which means brown fat production has basically been turned off in our bodies,\" he said.\n\nUsing the cold to lose weight without exercise is theoretically possible by ratcheting down the thermostat to the point where you feel chilly all the time, Chawla said.\n\nA Japanese study published last year showed subjects who donned hospital gowns and spent several hours a day in a 61-degree room lost about a pound in six weeks. Keep up this routine over the course of the year and you would expect to drop about 15 pounds without setting foot in the gym, Chawla said.\n\nHowever, as Chawla pointed out, most people have little tolerance for such discomfort. They'd prefer to stay toasty warm.\n\n\"Enduring a few moments of cold each day in the winter isn't enough to stimulate brown fat production,\" Chawla said. \"People may actually gain weight in colder months because they tend to move less and eat more.\"\n\nThe solution, Chawla said, may eventually come in the form of a pill.\n\n\"Pharmacologically, we may be able to develop something that stimulates brown fat cells without the exposure to cold,\" he said."}

And at the time, Brandi knew her son, who was born addicted to opiates, would have an uphill battle.\n\n\"Connor is severely delayed psychologically, physically and emotionally,\" she explained. \"He is nonverbal and requires speech therapy. It is unknown whether he has the ability to speak with a limited vocabulary.\"\n\nSince he also has issues with gross motor skill, even Connor's use of sign language is extremely difficult.\n\nSince his adoption, Connor has been diagnosed with a chromosomal disorder called DiGeorge syndrome, damage to the brain and nervous system, and autism.

Finally, Connor has found a friend he can relate to.\n\n\"It warms my heart like nothing else,\" Brandi said.\n\nOn Thursday, Brandi said she's hoping to receive official papers to adopt Ellie and make her a permanent member of the family.

{"text": "RALEIGH, N.C. (Reuters) - North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory said on Wednesday he will sign a law requiring pregnant women to wait three days between consulting a doctor and having an abortion, among the longest waiting periods in the nation.\n\nA pro-life activist holds a doll and banner while advocating his stance on abortion near the site of the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina on September 4, 2012. REUTERS/Adrees Latif\n\nMcCrory, a Republican, faced intense lobbying from pro-choice advocates who hoped he would veto the measure, citing his campaign promise not to sign any further restrictions on abortion.\n\nBut in a statement released late Wednesday, McCrory said that the final version of the bill met his approval. He noted that he had worked with legislators to ensure that initial contact made with a health care provider could be a phone call, so the law would not require separate office visits.\n\n\"Some very positive progress was made during the last several days to protect women's health,\" McCrory said. \"Therefore, I will sign this bill.\"\n\nOnce the measure becomes law, North Carolina will join Missouri, South Dakota and Utah in requiring a 72-hour waiting period. Last month, Oklahoma also adopted a 72-hour waiting period. A total of 24 states require some waiting period before an abortion can be performed, and several are considering new or longer restrictions this year.\n\nNorth Carolina's bill triples the state's current 24-hour waiting period. McCrory's vow to sign it came after the state House of Representatives gave its final approval, agreeing to slightly modified form that passed the Senate on Monday. The house initially approved the bill in April. All three votes fell largely along party lines.\n\nProtesters rallied on Wednesday in Raleigh and in Charlotte, where McCrory was once mayor, to urge a veto. At one rally, the side of a truck bore McCrory's image alongside his campaign promise.\n\nCritics noted that McCrory signed into law a previous measure tightening regulation of abortion clinics. In a statement urging McCrory to veto the waiting period bill, Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said he was being given \"a second chance to make good on his promise not to interfere with women's access to safe, legal, essential health care.\"\n\n\"No one should be forced to delay health care because politicians have the audacity to presume to know what is best for a woman and her family,\" said Northup, whose organization advocates for abortion rights, in a statement."}
{"text": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\n\nStates will not be allowed to block federal funding to health care providers for performing abortions, thanks to under a new rule from the Obama administration. Under the regulation, states will be prohibited from withholding federal grants for family planning from Planned Parenthood. On Wednesday, the Department of Health and Human Service finalized the rule, which was first proposed about three months ago.\n\nThe move comes in the wake of a national effort by Republicans to defund Planned Parenthood—both in statehouses around the country and in Congress—which took off after the anti-abortion nonprofit Center for Medical Progress released secretly recorded and deceptively edited videos in 2015 that it claimed showed Planned Parenthood officials discussing the illegal sale of fetal tissue. The videos have been widely discredited, but the attacks on access to reproductive health care continue.\n\nPresident Barack Obama warned states earlier this year that they'd be \"out of compliance with federal law\" if they refused to make Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood clinics. Several states have tried to block Medicaid funds, which they receive from the federal government and distribute to health care providers, from going to clinics that perform abortions, even though federal law already prohibits that money from being used for abortions in almost all cases. State courts have also found restrictions illegal because they limit health care access for low-income recipients.\n\nBut the question of whether states can choose to withhold family planning grants—known as Title X funds—from health care providers that perform abortions has remained unanswered until now. According to Planned Parenthood, 85 percent of people who benefit from Title X have incomes below the federal poverty line, and nearly half are uninsured.\n\nThe rule prohibiting states from withholding Title X funds will go into effect just two days before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Trump has said he wants to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\n\"President Obama has cemented his legacy as a champion for women's health,\" Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood, said in a statement. \"This rule protects birth control, cancer screenings, STI testing and treatment, and other health care for millions of people. Yet this fight is not over. We are deeply concerned about the future of health care access in this country with extremists like Mike Pence and and Tom Price at the helm.\"\n\nPrice, Trump's pick for secretary of health and human services, has a long history of working to limit access to contraception and abortion, as Mother Jones reported last week. Reproductive rights advocates are also concerned about Congress, where both chambers voted a year ago to defund Planned Parenthood. Only Obama's veto stood in the way."}

It took former President Ronald Reagan several years to cut that many pages of regulations.\n\n\"President Trump compared to his predecessors is—so far—the least regulatory president of all,\" CEI's director of technology studies Clyde Wayne Crews wrote in an updated report on Trump's deregulatory effort.\n\nCrews reported the Trump administration has also cut the number of new regulations issued this year 18 percent from the end of the Obama administration. Included in that is a 58 percent decrease in \"significant\" rules that come with a $100 million or greater price tag.\n\n\"As we continue to watch the president's progress on his economic priorities, it's interesting to compare Trump with previous presidents, namely Ronald Reagan,\" Crews wrote. \"Under Reagan, both regulations and Federal Register pages dropped more than one-third. So far, Trump has reduced the flow of regulation even more.\"\n\nUpon taking office, Trump promised get rid of 70 percent of federal regulations. The president signed an executive order asking federal agencies to cut two existing regulations for every new proposed.\n\nA coalition of left-leaning groups sued Trump in February, asking the court to overturn the executive order to repeal two regulations for every new one issued.\n\nThe groups argued the order would \"block or force the repeal of regulations needed to protect health, safety, and the environment, across a broad range of topics – from automobile safety, to occupational health, to air pollution, to endangered species.\"\n\nAs part of the order, federal agencies created task forces to identify regulations ripe for repeal.

{"text": "One such drug, AstraZeneca's Lynparza, is already on the market and several more are in development. Tesaro recently announced positive data in ovarian cancer for its PARP inhibitor, raising the perceived value of other drugs of its type. Medivation and Pfizer say theirs could be the most potent and might be used in combination with Pfizer's Ibrance, but that remains to be seen.\n\nIf Pfizer is interested in the PARP inhibitor now, it was not so much a few years ago. In 2011, it divested its own PARP inhibitor to Clovis Oncology for a convertible promissory note worth a mere $7 million. Pfizer will also be eligible for payments of up to $259 million and a midteen percentage royalty if the Clovis drug, called rucaparib, reaches the market.\n\nThe other Medivation drug in development, pidilizumab, could help the body's immune system fight cancer, though its mechanism of action is not known. This approach, called immunotherapy, is the hottest area in oncology, or perhaps all of medicine, and Pfizer is trying to catch up to leaders like Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck.\n\nStill, Mr. Read said in a conference call with analysts on Monday that Pfizer's valuation of Medivation was based largely on the prospects for Xtandi, which it hopes can be used earlier in the course of prostate cancer than it is now.\n\n\"We believe that Pfizer is the ideal partner to extend the reach of our blockbuster Xtandi franchise and take our promising, late-stage assets — talazoparib and pidilizumab — to their next stages of development so that they can be made available to patients as quickly as possible,\" David Hung, founder and chief executive of Medivation, which is based in San Francisco, said in the news release.\n\nXtandi competes mainly with Johnson & Johnson's Zytiga. There is some prospect that there could be generic versions of Zytiga coming in the next few years, which could affect sales of Xtandi, though Pfizer executives said in a conference call to discuss the deal that they think Xtandi will be able to compete even with Zytiga generics.\n\nJohnson & Johnson is also developing another prostate cancer drug, apalutamide, invented by the same researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, who invented Xtandi. Medivation had sued, saying it had the right to that drug as well, but it lost."}

A review board selected by CIA Director Brennan concluded in December 2014 that this CIA search 'resulted in inappropriate access to [Senate Intelligence Committee] work product'.\"\n\n\n[...]\n\n\n\"We believe that it is necessary for you to ensure that senior officials in your administration recognize the importance of adhering to the rule of law,\" the lawmakers wrote to Obama. \"We ask that you instruct Director Brennan to acknowledge that the CIA's unauthorized search of Senate files was improper and will not be repeated.\"\n\n[T]he documents turned over to VICE News included a July 28, 2014 letter from Brennan that was addressed to Feinstein and Saxby Chambliss, who was then the ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee, in which he apologized to them and admitted that the CIA's penetration of the computer network used by committee staffers reviewing the agency's torture program was improper.\n\nThe White House and CIA have yet to comment on the letter and there's nothing in the history of the incident that suggests either will move forward on this. Obama's on short time and the CIA already cleared itself of all wrongdoing with an in-house \"investigation\" and further showed its disdain for independent oversight by throwing its Inspector General and his report on the spying efforts under the bus.Jason Leopold and Vice obtained hundreds of documents through FOIA requests that appeared to show the opposite of what the CIA's internal investigation claimed. But it was the CIA that had the last word, proclaiming itself innocent and simultaneously accusing Senate staffers of improperly accessing restricted documents.But the most damning document -- at least in the context of a demand for an official apology from the CIA -- was the apology the agency unofficially disavowed when it cleared itself of hacking allegations.The thing is, Brennan never signed or sent this apology. It just sat in a Torture Report-related file until it was FOIAed. Brennan even offered a closed-door, off-the-record apology to Dianne Feinstein, but to date, the final official word remains the CIA's: we did nothing wrong."}

That's when she decided to surprise him by creating a \"Happy Birthday Colin\" Facebook page.\n\n\"I created this page for my amazing, wonderful, challenging son who is about to turn 11 on March 9th. Because of Colin's disabilities, social skills are not easy for him, and he often acts out in school, and the other kids don't like him,\" Cunningham wrote on February 2, when she created the page. \"So I thought, if I could create a page where people could send him positive thoughts and encouraging words, that would be better than any birthday party.\"\n\nIn just 10 days, the page has reached more than 1.4 million likes. Tens of thousands of people from around the world have commented on the page, wishing Colin happy birthday and commending Cunningham for helping her son.

{"text": "By Oregon Cattlemen's Association\n\nOne thing was evident during a May tour the representatives of the Oregon Cattlemen's Association took of the Prairie and Little Sheep Creek watershed in Enterprise with water quality program officials from the Oregon Department of Agriculture and the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality.\n\nWhat was so clear was that a vast amount of conservation work has been done by landowners. Even more impressive is that the Wallowa Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD) officials found promising results of improved water quality through their monitoring program.\n\nBill Moore, the OCA's past president, showed examples of how riparian areas have responded to grazing and total exclusion, along with the fact that weeds were a reoccurring problem in the non-grazed areas. Moore also showed significant challenges in addressing legacy issues, such as channelization projects funded by government programs more than 20 years ago, which are now believed to adversely affect water quality.\n\nOn the tour, Cynthia Warnock, of the Wallowa SWCD, described extensive efforts to establish trees and willows on several sites along the riparian areas, saying that less than one percent of the plantings had been successful. Kyle Bratcher, an Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife official, said there have been more favorable results in establishing woody vegetation with a new technique being implemented by placing wire panels around naturally establishing seedlings to protect them from wildlife, rather than completely fencing off a riparian area.\n\nA local rancher pointed to one part of their riparian area excluded from grazing and explained how weeds, deer, elk and rodents have been a challenging factors in their conservation efforts. This was a unique opportunity to see and discuss side by side comparisons of grazed and non-grazed riparian areas, along with restoration efforts compared with actual conditions achieved.\n\nOCA Water Resources Chair, Curtis Martin, said, \"It was particularly encouraging to hear that the agencies intend to take a wide range of site specific factors, historical information, along with input from area stakeholders when updating local Ag Water Quality Plans and Rules. When it comes to setting TMDLs for non-point sources, it is important decisions are being based on measurable results of improve water quality and appropriate monitoring is implemented.\"\n\nThe conclusion of the tour was just a few short miles away, where the group viewed the aftermath of a public land fire in the upland which has had a considerable impact on water quality throughout the entire watershed for decades. Those on the tour said the final stop on the tour drove home how significant factors outside the control of individual landowners can have on water quality throughout the entire watershed."}

{"text": "(Reuters) - California Governor Jerry Brown signed new insurance requirements on ridesharing companies into law on Wednesday, but the regulations come at a far lower cost to the industry than previously written into the bill, officials said.\n\nCalifornia Governor Jerry Brown gestures during a news conference at Memoria y Tolerancia museum in Mexico City July 28, 2014. REUTERS/Edgard Garrido\n\nCompanies such as Lyft, Sidecar and UberX, which is a part of black-car service Uber, allow passengers to summon paid rides using apps on their smartphones and have gained in popularity in dozens of U.S. cities over the past few years.\n\nBut they face opposition from taxi companies that argue the upstarts do not face the same stringent regulations as do traditional cabs, and insurance companies want ridesharing drivers to carry more expensive insurance policies.\n\nThe law requires ridesharing companies' insurance to cover drivers from the moment they turn on their app, not just from when they accept a ride on their app, according to information from the office of California Assemblywoman Susan Bonilla, who championed the bill.\n\nDrivers under the new law must maintain primary liability insurance coverage of at least $50,000 per person and $100,000 per occurrence for death and personal injury during the time they log on to the application, as well as $30,000 for property damage, her office said. The insurance can be paid by the driver or the rideshare company.\n\nAn earlier version of the bill required $750,000 worth of insurance coverage in that window, down from $1 million in the previous draft, it said.\n\nThe move to dictate more extensive coverage stems from a New Year's Eve incident in San Francisco when an UberX driver killed a child while his app was on, but before he had accepted a ride.\n\n\"We have agreed to a compromise that provides clarity for the ridesharing community in California,\" Lyft spokeswoman Chelsea Wilson said in a statement.\n\nUber spokeswoman Eva Behrend said: \"We are our proud that our governor has recognized that Californians love Uber.\"\n\nThe companies, which initially opposed stricter requirements, ultimately supported the final bill after Bonilla agreed to lower the amount of insurance required when drivers do not have passengers in their vehicles, Bonilla's office said in a statement.\n\nThe driver must also maintain $1 million for personal injury and property damage from the time a ride request is accepted until the passenger exits the vehicle, her office said.\n\nBrown announced on Wednesday he had signed the bill into law and its provisions will take effect next summer."}
{"text": "Do not speed over this bridge. It will cost you. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)\n\nBe careful next time you fail to signal while driving through the Hollywood hills, or speed over the Golden Gate bridge, or roll through a stop sign on Coronado: Breaking traffic laws in California turns out to be really expensive.\n\nThe Center for Investigative Reporting tells the story of Derick Neal, a software engineer who apparently triggered a red light camera in April. The ticket Neal got in the mail cost him $490 — and he had to spend an extra $59 on traffic school.\n\nMore than 6 million Californians get traffic tickets every year, and the price is shooting up. Running a red light would have cost Neal $103 in 1993; today, it's almost five times that price. Driving more than 15 miles per hour over the speed limit will earn a $238 fine. And heaven help you if you park in a space reserved for a handicapped driver — that's a $1,107 ticket.\n\nCash-strapped governments frequently use traffic tickets to fill budget gaps. Speed cameras and red-light cameras netted $85 million for Washington, D.C. in Fiscal Year 2012, and now the city says it will install cameras at even more intersections. The Center for Investigative Research cited a California Research Bureau study that estimated the Golden State took in more than half a billion dollars in traffic violations in 2006.\n\nThe introduction of traffic cameras has led to an increase in the number of tickets that are contested. About 4.5 percent of all tickets issued were contested in 2003; that number spiked to 7.1 percent by 2011, the Center reported.\n\nIt's not just the state (or district) that gets in on the revenue. Counties, hospitals, courts and the state's DNA identification fund get in on the action. Here's how California breaks down that massive bill you risk if you park in a handicapped spot without the proper documentation:\n\nBase fine: $250\n\nState penalty: $250\n\nCounty penalty: $175\n\nDNA identification fund: $125\n\nCourt construction fund: $125\n\nState surcharge: $50\n\nEmergency medical service fund: $50\n\nEmergency medical air service fund: $4\n\nCourt operations: $40\n\nConviction assessment: $35\n\nNight court fund: $1\n\nTAP fee: $2\n\nTotal: $1,107.\n\nSee the whole roster of infractions and how much they'll cost you here [pdf] courtesy the Judicial Council of California."}

The below article's quotes were taken a bit out of context: http://www.rt.com/news/bolivia-coca-cola-ban-770/\n\nIn a symbolic rejection of US capitalism, Bolivia announced it [hopes to] expel the Coca-Cola Company from the country at the end of the Mayan calendar. This will mark the end of capitalism and usher in a new era of equality, the Bolivian govt says.\n\n\"December 21 of 2012 will be the end of egoism and division. December 21 should be the end of Coca-Cola,\"Bolivian foreign minister David Choquehuanca decreed, with bombast worthy of a viral marketing campaign.\n\nThe coming 'end' of the Mayan lunar calendar on December 21 of this year has sparked widespread doomsaying of an impending apocalypse. But Choquehuanca argued differently, claiming it will be the end of days for capitalism, not the planet.\n\n\n\"The planets will align for the first time in 26,000 years and this is the end of capitalism and the beginning of communitarianism,\" said Choquehuanca as quoted by Venezuelan newspaper El Periodiquito.\n\nThe minister encouraged the people of Bolivia to drink Mocochinche, a peach-flavored soft drink, as an alternative to Coca-Cola. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez followed suit, encouraging his country to ditch the American beverage for fruit juice produced in Venezuela.\n\nMcFailure\n\nLast year, Bolivia became the second Latin American country not to have a single McDonald's. The fast food giant finally gave up on Bolivia after being unable to turn a profit in the country for over a decade.\n\nFollowing this failure, the monolithic multinational released a documentary titled 'Why McDonald's failed in Bolivia.'Referencing surveys, sociologists, nutritionists and historians, the company came to the conclusion it was not their food that was the issue, but a culturally driven boycott.\n\nBolivian President Evo Morales has a reputation for controversial policies similar to the Coca-Cola ban. Morales pledged last month to legalize the consumption of coca leaves, one of the main ingredients of cocaine.\n\n\n\"Neither the US nor capitalist countries have a good reason to maintain the ban on coca leaf consumption,\" said Morales.\n\nThe coca leaf was declared an illegal narcotic by the UN in 1961, along with cocaine, opium and morphine.

File photo by Maryam Rahmanian/ UPI | License Photo\n\nBRUSSELS, Nov. 29 (UPI) -- The European Union on Sunday offered Turkey billions of dollars in aid as part of a deal to stanch the flow of migrants into Europe.\n\nThe E.U. will give the Ankara government $3.2 billion -- and will revive talks for Turkey to enter the union -- in exchange for it to keep Middle Eastern refugees inside Turkish borders.\n\nThe BBC quoted Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who stood in for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the meeting in Brussels, Belgium, as saying it was a \"historic day\" in relations between Turkey and the E.U.\n\nUnder the agreement, Turkish citizens may be allowed access to the E.U.'s 28 member states through the visa-free Schengen zone.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said the most important part of the negotiations was to \"replace illegal migration with legal migration,\" and that while Turkey had so far sheltered more than 2 million Syrians, it \"had received little international support for that and therefore rightly expects that the European Union and the member states attempt to lighten Turkey's burden.\"\n\nThe International Organization for Migration says 721,217 migrants arrived in Greece between Jan. 1 and Nov. 25, 2015, while 143,114 arrived in Italy over the same period.

Throughout the weekend, there will be a raffle for the chance win an 18-inch doughnut and other prizes.\n\nEven if you miss out then, the freebies will continue every day, year-round. At 5:30 AM daily, Sugar Shack will post a challenge on its social media feeds, whether it's doing a yoga pose or singing a song, to get a free doughnut.\n\nOwner Rob Krupicka (a former Democratic member of the Virginia House of Delegates) says that all the locations use the same dough recipe, but each store makes its own glazes and fillings. Between 25 and 30 flavors are available in the case at any given time, including staples like chocolate sprinkles and cinnamon-sugar alongside more unusual options like cucumber-melon and pineapple-serrano. The doughnut operation has nearly 400 recipes in rotation.\n\nThe Shaw shop will also partner with local breweries, including Right Proper, for beer-based doughnut glazes. Other booze-inspired flavors, like blackberry-bourbon and peach fuzzy navel, will be the focus of an evening menu dubbed \"Donuts After Dark.\" It's available Thursdays through Saturdays, when the shop is open until 2 AM. (Because the alcohol is cooked off, you don't have to be 21 to order them.)\n\nThe doughnut shop will also have a full coffee bar plus nitro cold brew and kombucha on tap. Some alcoholic drinks will be available in the evenings, and downstairs, you'll find an entire cocktail lounge called Nocturne. The bar will be reminiscent of Captain Gregory's, a cocktail lounge hidden inside Sugar Shack's Alexandria location. Nocturne, however, will serve \"tapas-style\" cocktails in mix-and-match flights.

{"text": "PHOTO: Dick Culbert/Flickr\n\nAugust 24, 2016\n\nWhile cravings for sweet-tasting treats are an almost universal human experience, sugar and some sugar substitutes have long been known to wreak havoc on the human body. While moderation is clearly the best policy when it comes to all kinds of sweets, there are also some sweet herbs whose flavor can be enjoyed in place of refined sugar.\n\n\nAztec Sweet Herb (Phyla dulcis syn. Lippia dulcis)\n\nThe intense sweet flavor in the leaves and flower buds of this Central and South American native plant (pictured above)—called Tzonpelic xihuitl by the Aztecs—is a compound that reportedly tastes about 1,000 times as sweet as refined sugar. A single leaf or flower can give a satisfying sweetness to a cup of tea and has the added bonus of not causing tooth decay.\n\nThe plant is sold under a variety of common names, one being \"mayan mint\"—though it is not truly a mint, but rather, a member of the verbena family. It can be grown outdoors in the summer and as an attractive vining houseplant in winter.\n\nStevia (Stevia rebaudiana)\n\nThis South American native is one of the better-known herbal sugar substitutes. Most people just call it \"stevia,\" but it is also known as \"candyleaf,\" \"sugarleaf,\" or \"Paraguayan sweet herb.\" It's a member of the aster family, so it's related to daisies and Echinacea. The main sweet compound, called stevioside, tastes 150 to 320 times as sweet as refined sugar.\n\nStevia is an herbaceous plant that can be grown as an annual in a well-drained garden bed. It grows from both seeds and herbaceous cuttings.\n\nLicorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra)\n\nLong used in Europe as a flavoring in candies and confections, the roots of this pea-family plant contain a sweet compound called glycyrrhizin, which is 30 to 50 times as sweet-tasting as table sugar.\n\nLicorice plants are perennial in USDA zones 7 to 10. They have deep-penetrating roots, and because they are nitrogen-fixing legumes, they can grow in poor soil. In colder zones, they can be grown under heavy mulch cover or over-wintered in pot that is moved to a garage or greenhouse during the colder parts of the season."}

The upgraded projectiles can intercept incoming aircraft and missiles.\n\nIt is the first time the ministry has confirmed the deployment, after speculation following the publication of photographs last month that showed the missiles in air defence bases in eastern Taiwan.\n\nUntil now, PAC-3 systems were believed to have been located close to the populous cities of Taipei, Taichung and Kaohsiung, reported Taiwan News.\n\nREUTERS"}

It was an effort to outflank Sanders' chief rival for the Democrats' leading contender for President, Hillary Clinton.\n\nSpeaking to Latino elected and appointed officials in Las Vegas, the Vermont Senator delivered a rousing sermon about economic populism and social justice a day after Clinton offered remarks to the same crowd. While there were fewer reporters crowded on the press riser, Sanders still drew a full ballroom on the glitzy Vegas Strip and brought the crowd to its feet several times.\n\n\"Brothers and sisters, there is a lot of work to be done,\" said Sanders, a political Independent who caucuses with the Democrats. \"But when we stand up to those people on top whose greed has done so much damage to this country … there is no limit to what this great country can accomplish.\"\n\nSanders said he backs President Barack Obama's policy that spared some younger immigrants in the country illegally deportation. It was particularly helpful to children whose parents were brought them to the country as children, occasionally known as Dreamers.\n\nSanders he would expand the program to \"parents of citizens, parents of legal permanent residents and parents of Dreamers.\"\n\n\"We cannot and we should not be talking about sweeping up millions of men, women and children, many of whom have been in this country for years,\" Sanders said to applause. He said splitting up families—leaving children in the United States while parents or cousins were sent home—was against the country's values.\n\nSanders, for sure, is running behind Clinton in polling and fundraising. But he has been workmanlike in building a campaign. His slow-and-steady approach has captured the imagination of Democrats' most liberal corners, who are skeptical if not hostile to a second Clinton being President.\n\nSanders has been tapping into that sentiment, all the while avoiding any direct criticism of the former Secretary of State and Senator. Clinton remains the party's favorite candidate and has a far larger political machine behind her.\n\n\"American kids who deserve the right to be in the country they know as home,\" said Sanders, whose father came to the United States from Poland. \"We are a nation of immigrants. That is, in fact, the strength of America.\"\n\nAs Sanders made his way toward the exit, conference participants rushed toward him, cell phones held overhead to snap pictures and arms stretched out to shake his hand. He may not win the Democrats' nomination but he certainly spoke to the party's base."}

On Wednesday, Enbridge Energy Partners L.P. estimated it will incur approximately $175-million more in costs to pay for the additional work. \"This estimate is an increase to the total estimated costs of $820-million related to the Line 6B crude oil release that was previously disclosed and excludes any additional fines and penalties,\" it said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n\"The actual costs incurred may differ from the foregoing estimate as we discuss our work plan with the EPA and work with other regulatory agencies to assure that our work plan complies with their requirements. Any such incremental costs will not be recovered under our insurance policies as our expected costs for the incident will exceed the limits of our insurance coverage.\"\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe partnership operates the U.S. portion of Enbridge's oil pipeline network, which moves more than two million barrels a day to the U.S. Midwest, Midcontinent and Southern Ontario from Western Canada.\n\nLate Wednesday, a spokesman from parent company Enbridge Inc. said at this point the company won't discuss its total out-of-pocket costs. But he noted the annual report, which stated claims for the Line 6B release are covered by Enbridge's comprehensive insurance policy. That policy had an aggregate limit of $650-million (U.S.) for pollution liability.\n\n\"We are still in the middle of this process and cannot determine what total costs will be,\" Graham White said in an e-mail.\n\nMore than three million litres of oil leaked into wetlands, Talmadge Creek and the Kalamazoo River after a pipeline ruptured near Marshall, Mich., on July 25, 2010. A ruling last year by a U.S. regulator pummelled Enbridge's response, describing it as being so poor that \"you can't help but think of the Keystone Kops.\"\n\nThe spill, the largest onshore oil spill in U.S. history, has given significant ammunition to opponents of new projects, including TransCanada's proposed Keystone XL pipeline and Enbridge's Northern Gateway.\n\nWith a report from Reuters"}
{"text": "Credit: Lilla Frerichs/public domain Plants which used to have two types of male reproductive organs – to increase their chances for fertilisation – are reverting back to one type. And in some cases, they are becoming self-fertilising.\n\nThis \"reverse evolution\" could provide new hope for people worried about declining numbers of pollinators, such as bees.\n\nResearchers from the University of Stirling and the University of Illinois turned their attention on the buffalo bur, a prickly species from Mexico and North America. It's part of the same family of \"nightshade\" plants as the tomato and the humble potato.\n\nThe bur has evolved unusual flowers with two types of male reproductive organs – or anthers.\n\n\"One type of feeding anther has evolved to lure pollen-eating bees, whilst another pollinating anther sneaks behind the bees' backs and deposits pollen for fertilising other flowers\", says Dr Mario Vallejo-Marín from Stirling's School of Natural Sciences.\n\n\"This elaborate pollination strategy has evolved multiple times in bee-pollinated flowers of many plant families, and is an example of how natural selection can produce the similar results from different starting points.\"\n\nBut he adds: \"Evolution sometimes reverses on itself. We've discovered that this complicated division of labour within flowers can breakdown repeatedly, and produce species with flowers that revert back towards the ancestral form of only one type of anthers.\"\n\nIn a study, published in the Royal Society journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, the researchers say this \"reversion\" to smaller flowers – with one functional type of anthers – may be caused by the loss of pollinators (such as bees) of the right size required to fertilise the flowers.\n\nCompetition for pollination between closely related species can also be a factor.\n\n\"Plants can dynamically adapt to changing numbers and types of pollinating bees,\" says Dr Vallejo-Marín, \"A loss of pollinating bees may favour the evolution of smaller, self-fertilising flowers that don't require pollinators.\"\n\nThe buffalo bur is regarded as a weed – and an invasive species in some countries. But falls in bee numbers are a bigger worry for other crops.\n\n\"Whether the reversion towards self-fertilisation can provide an escape route from ecological bee shortages depends on how rapidly plants can evolve. In the current pollinator crisis, understanding how plants adapt to changes in bee numbers and type is essential.\"\n\nExplore further: Flower's bellows organ blasts pollen at bird pollinators"}

Tipping the scales at as little as 1,470 pounds for the Beast 300, the lightweight, unfiltered fun should remain. With its 315 horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder, the Beast 300 can hit 60 mph in just 2.9 seconds.\n\nAnd that's before you get to the Beast 500, cranking out 500 horsepower from a 2.4-liter supercharged engine.

The name suggests that the bike might not be homologated for street use, but time will have to tell on that.\n\nFrom looking at the concept bike in Milan, we can see that the carbon fiber chassis is joined by carbon fiber wheels and carbon fiber fairings. As such, we would expect a 20 lbs weight reduction, or more, from HP4 Race compared to the older HP4 model.\n\nThat should make the BMW HP4 Race one of the lightest superbikes on the market, though that ultimate title will likely stay with its Italian counterpart.\n\nOther items we see are an Akrapovic exhaust, Brembo brakes, and Öhlins FGR forks (likely paired with an Öhlins TTX rear shock) – all standard items for a track-focused machine that spares no expense.\n\nYou have to feel bad for BMW in a way though, debuting such a bombshell of a bike, just a day after Ducati dropped the 1299 Superleggera, sort of steals the thunder from such a spectacular machine. Still, the S1000RR is one of the best superbikes on the market, and it only got better in its HP4 trim.\n\nAs such, we expect great things from the BMW HP4 Race once it officially debuts. The question is though, how many will be built, and how much will they cost?

As the bridge crumbles and deteriorates at an accelerated pace, it could potentially close by 2021, according to Jenny Anzelmo-Sarles of the National Park Service.\n\nThe bridge, which spans 2,100 feet, has a $250 million price tag to stay open in the long term. The NPS has been trying to raise this funding for the past four years. But the agency's annual budget is $3 billion, and only $268 million is currently going toward transportation infrastructure.\n\n\"The National Park Service will need the support of partnerships with other federal, state, and local entities, to compete successfully for funds available from the Department of Transportation,\" park service director Jonathan Jarvis said in a release. \"We are pursuing every funding possibility to find a path forward to repair Memorial Bridge.\"\n\nArlington Memorial Bridge facing 2021 closure w/o $250mil fix.

Vehicles driving on the open parts of the crossing were restricted to a 10-ton load limit, eliminating most buses from traveling across the span. That limit still stands today.\n\nThe agency also moved up temporary repairs, which were supposed to start in the fall. At the time, the bridge topped the American Road & Transportation Builders Association's list of the most-traveled structurally deficient bridges in D.C. The unfortunate distinction is mostly due to the corrosion of the steel in the drawbridge portion, plus some supportive materials are missing altogether, according to the NPS.\n\nThe bridge is crossed more than 68,000 times a day. And if the drawbridge fails, there could be a six-to-eight inch drop in the roadway.\n\nThe crossing connects the Lincoln Memorial with Arlington National Cemetery and the Robert E. Lee Memorial. It was built to commemorate the reunification of the United States after the Civil War and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nA temporary fix is scheduled to begin next year at a cost of $5 million."}

{"text": "Jump to content\n\nQ From Martin Turner, Hong Kong: A simple question, but it's bothering me. Where does crib come from in the sense of a cheat's answer sheet or illicitly copying somebody else's work? It's listed as the same word as the baby's bed, but the connection is beyond me.\n\nA It is the same word, though you may not be surprised to hear that a lot more lies behind it. The use of the term for a baby's cot is more common in US English than in Britain, where it's mainly reserved for a model of the Nativity of Christ, with a manger as a bed. The verb to crib in the sense of plagiarism or stealing another's schoolwork is mainly British English, though both US and British English know crib notes. Both varieties of English share the sense of a barred container or rack for animal fodder, a manger. This is the original, which turns up in English around the year 1000 and which is from an Old German word whose descendants are to be found in modern Dutch and German.\n\n\nOne sense of crib.\n\nThere are other senses of crib, especially that of a small house, cabin or hovel (from an extension of the sense of an animal stall), which eventually led to the meaning in the South Island of New Zealand of a small house at the seaside or at a holiday resort, to thieves' slang of the early nineteenth century for a house, shop or public-house and to the slightly later US slang usage for a saloon, a low dive, or brothel (and also the current US Black English sense of one's room, house or apartment). The baby's bed doesn't arrive until the seventeenth century as an application of the barred container idea, others from the same source being a repository for hops during harvest and a wickerwork basket or pannier. A shift from container to contents may explain why it has sometimes meant a light meal or a workman's lunch, though it's also suggested that an eighteenth-century slang sense of the stomach may be the direct link.\n\nThe basket sense was used in particular for one in which a poacher might conceal his catch. The experts guess this may have led to the thievery sense around the middle of the eighteenth century. Much rests on an appearance in Samuel Foote's play The Nabob of 1778: \"A brace of birds and a hare, that I cribbed this morning out of a basket of game.\" The plagiarism sense arrived at around the same time, though it seems to have become applied to stealing another's school work only in the following century."}

If you're not familiar with \"Dual Survival,\" you still may know Lundin as \"the guy who doesn't wear any shoes.\" Lundin never wore footwear for the show, except in extreme cold, and would resort to wearing some type of socks. Though Lundin, who specializes in aboriginal living skills, and Teti, who is a former Marine and Special Forces soldier, would bicker at times, they had not gotten into a full-on argument, until Season 4.\n\nSeason 4 promises to show viewers how to endure and hopefully conquer some of the most challenging survival situations. Lundin and Teti might be able to survive the wild, but their partnership apparently wasn't able to endure Season 4. The specific reason why Lundin was fired isn't currently known, but he took to his Facebook page on Feb. 17 to address viewers and fans about his mid-season departure.\n\nHis full statement has been posted below:\n\nDear Campers,\n\nUnfortunately, I have been fired by Discovery Channel for differences over safety and health concerns on the show and will no longer be a part of Dual Survival.\n\nAlthough I'll miss elements of the show, what I'll miss the most are my fans and the opportunity to teach - on a global level – life saving skills, indigenous culture, and values of integrity and respect toward our natural world.\n\nI have received numerous letters from viewers. Many are from kids, or their parents or grandparents, describing in detail how the show has changed their lives. It has brought families together, inspired kids to go outdoors, and motivated moms and dads around the world to take that family camping trip, many for the first time. If I can use a TV show to encourage people to turn off TV and turn on nature, I have done my job.\n\nThank you all very much for your support over the years. Be safe and prepared, and maybe I'll train with you in the woods some day!\n\nStay classy, Cody Lundin\n\nHis contentious last episode of \"Dual Survival\" is slated to air on the Discovery Channel Wednesday 9/8c. Tune in to presumably find out why Lundin is no longer a part of the show.\n\nFollow me on Twitter @mariamzzarella"}
{"text": "THE Van Allen belts, which were discovered in 1958 by some of the first artificial satellites, are a bane of those satellites' successors. The outer belt, which begins at an altitude of 13,000km above Earth's surface and goes up to 60,000km, is full of energetic electrons. The inner one, at 1,000-6,000km, is full of energetic protons. Both play havoc with satellites' electronics.\n\nBut what if you could sweep them away? This is the ambition of Reinhard Friedel, a physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, in New Mexico, and his colleagues. Dr Friedel reckons you could do the job with radio waves. In principle this should work because the gap between the inner and outer belts is maintained by natural radio waves from things like lightning.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\nParticles in the Van Allen belts are constantly on the move, following the lines of Earth's magnetic field towards the poles, gyrating as they travel. As they approach a pole, however, the laws of electrodynamics that govern the behaviour of gyrating particles force them to reverse their direction and head back towards the opposite pole. If a particle is moving towards a pole faster, it will come closer to Earth before bounding back and is more likely to hit an air molecule. If it does so it is, to use the jargon, \"precipitated\" into the atmosphere where it gives up its energy and never returns to space.\n\nSo the way to sweep the Van Allen belts clean of their troublesome electrons and protons is to bombard the particles with radio waves at a frequency that speeds them up as they head towards the poles. Protons are heavy and influencing them requires a lot of power. So sweeping the inner belt may be impractical. Electrons, however, are much lighter. That means a space-borne particle-sweeper for the outer Van Allen belt is a possibility, according to Dr Friedel. He reckons it would cost about $500m to launch and operate for 15 years. Not all satellites would benefit. But many, including all the geostationary communications satellites, have to contend with electrons in the outer belt. Sweeping could extend the life of all GPS satellites by two years, saving about $22m per satellite, or $660m in all.\n\nThe scheme is ambitious, but not foolhardy. Some talk of clearing larger chunks of space debris to stop them crashing into satellites. That would be hard. Sweeping away the cloud of electrons that surrounds Earth could be a better investment."}

{"text": "Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro at a rally at in Caracas on June 14. (Marco Bello/Reuters)\n\nAll this year, as they trudged through an unprecedented economic implosion, Venezuelans have been gearing up for what was meant to be the defining political event of the year: a referendum on whether to recall our increasingly loathed authoritarian president, Nicolás Maduro. The tense buildup suddenly ended Thursday as five separate (and supposedly independent, but c'mon now) lower courts approved injunctions to suspend the recall, closing down Venezuela's last best hope for a peaceful solution to its long-running political crisis.\n\nEven for battle-hardened Venezuelans, it all came as quite a shock. A major signature-gathering drive to officially activate the recall vote was scheduled for next week. Opposition activists were busy preparing their plans to get out their voters to sign. No one, not even the military, seemed to have been expecting this.\n\nToday has been a day of sober reckoning in Caracas, as Venezuelans process the death of the recall process and its implications. It's easy to overdramatize these things, I realize, but it's also important not to lose the forest for the trees: a relatively large, relatively sophisticated major oil producer just three hours' flying time from the United States has just become the second all-out, no-more-elections dictatorship in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThis is serious. A turning point.\n\nSee, for 17 years, political scientists have been casting about for a suitable way of describing the strange in-between political system Hugo Chávez invented for Venezuela. It wasn't quite democracy in the usual sense, clearly, but it also wasn't a normal dictatorship. The government might not have had much time for the fine print of constitutional rule, but in broad terms people were basically free to associate, speak and vote. What do you call that? Competitive authoritarianism? A hybrid regime? An illiberal democracy? None of the labels seemed to stick; what did stick was the lasting impression of in-betweenness, of Venezuela as not-quite-a-dictatorship.\n\nFor Venezuela's pro-democracy activists, fighting a regime that has instituted dictatorship by tiny increments has been an exhausting ordeal. Which is why today, mixed with the genuine anger at the subversion of our constitutional right to a recall, you can detect just a hint of gratitude for the clarity this brings.\n\nWe're rid of the adjectives. We are finally through with the academic circumlocutions.\n\nThere's no need to hyphenate it anymore. Venezuela is just a dictatorship."}

After dabbling with business-focused features for a while, Dropbox is now officially launching Dropbox for Business, with tools designed to make the service as convenient as possible for IT managers.\n\nDropbox for Business is really the rechristened Dropbox for Teams, which the company launched back in 2011. That service costs $795 a year for 1TB of storage and includes live support as well as many team-management tools. With Dropbox for Business, the service is getting single sign-on (SSO).\n\nWith SSO, IT managers will be able to let their company's employees sign into Dropbox with the same login info they use for all company services. It also means easier management of those with access to Dropbox folders, since SSO will be tied to active directory integration. If a company deletes someone from their main directory, that change will automatically be reflected in Dropbox.\n\nSEE ALSO: Dropbox Tips for Wizards, Intermediates & Beginners\n\n\"Opportunities have opened up to work with larger and larger businesses,\" says Dropbox vice president of business development Sujay Jaswa. \"Based on our conversations with these customers, the most requested feature was single sign-on.\"\n\nFor the new service, Dropbox has partnered with several sign-on identity providers, namely Ping Identity, Okta, OneLogin, Centrify and Symplified. Dropbox's SSO uses Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), an industry standard.\n\n\"Most businesses tend to already have an existing identity provider,\" says Dropbox for Business manager Anand Subramani. \"From the admin perspective, if you set this up correctly, the user may actually never even have to log into Dropbox. We can securely pass your credentials from your PC to Dropbox.\"\n\nBesides adding an IT-friendly feature (at no extra cost), Dropbox for Business also represents the company unquestionably entering the enterprise market, going head-to-head with others in the space such as Box.net.\n\n\"SSO using SAML is clearly an enterprise feature,\" says Jaswa. \"But our customers now range all the way from small businesses to divisions of large companies, and several large companies are talking to us about much larger deployments, and we wanted to come up a name that adequately reflected our customer base.\"\n\nWill your business consider using Dropbox now that it has single sign-on?

It affected many devices from various brands, which include the following:\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note2\n\nLG G4\n\nSamsung Galaxy S7\n\nSamsung Galaxy S4\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note4\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note5\n\nXiaomi Mi 4i\n\nXiaomi Redmi\n\nZTE X500\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note3\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note Edge\n\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S2\n\nSamsung Galaxy A5\n\nVivo X6 Plus\n\nAsus Zenfone 2\n\nLenovo S90\n\nOppo R7 Plus\n\nOppo N3\n\nLenovo A850\n\nMost of the malware found pre-installed on affected devices were information stealers and rough ad networks, which included a ransomware called Slocker. This crypto-malware uses AES encryption algorithm to lock a victim's files, and then demands money in exchange of unlocking them.\n\nCheck Point notes that the most notable rough adnet to target the devices is the Loki malware. \"The malware displays illegitimate advertisements to generate revenue,\" says the security firm. \"As part of its operation, the malware steals data about the device and installs itself to system, allowing it to take full control of the device and achieve persistency.\"\n\nWhile it is of course advised to be wary of where we download our apps, it is noted that pre-installed malware is a completely different problem to tackle. Check Point expounds further:\n\nPre-installed malware compromise the security even of the most careful users. In addition, a user who receives a device already containing malware will not be able to notice any change in the device's activity which often occur once a malware is installed. The discovery of the pre-installed malware raises some alarming issues regarding mobile security. Users could receive devices which contain backdoors or are rooted without their knowledge.\n\nThose who are interested in knowing more regarding the malware and the affected devices can check out the source link. Also, it is advised to utilize advanced security software which is capable of detecting and blocking malicious software, like Lookout or Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, which can help prevent malicious attacks in the long run.\n\nSource: Check Point Security via The Independent"}

Shizuku was never interested in wine before because of his past with them until he heard that his father was dead. His father is a famous food and wine critic. In the story he meets Tomine Issie and they are to compete each other for his father's inheritance. During his struggles, he will notice that the things that his father made him do in the past will help him in the future.Art: 10/10I love the art in here. It has a realistic feeling to it and find it rare to see that in some mangas. The details in here are absolutely amazing. Because of the story, the art describes of the feelings they are having. Not like the type of feeling of sadness or happiness but the feelings like when they smell or taste the wine, what they are imagining. I also like how they make the main guy look so regular and a total amateur at wine, but as something is related to wine, his looks changes to show just how serious and passion he actually has for wine.Character: 8/10Shizuku Kanzaki- The main character who is just a regular beer company worker. He wants to live a regular life and wants nothing with wine. Like a company dog, whenever he meets someone he automatically brings out a company card. His actions toward wine is honest and cute.Tomine Issie- The 'Prince of Wine' and of course, quite popular with the ladies. He is a genius at wine and is supposedly Shizuku's step brother a week before Shizuku's father's death. He competes with the protagonist to gain the inheritance. He's like a typical rival, but of course, we need someone in the story who is good at wine tasting to top it up.Shinohara- We start the manga with her. She wants to become a sommelier. She is the one who helps out the main character since he is a complete amateur when it comes to wine knowledge. She is the first one to realize his talents.Enjoyment: 9/10It is very easy to read and also enjoyable. If you are into rivalry, and competition things,then this story just may be for you! You don't even need to know about wine because this story will tell.Overall: 9/10This sums it up. Everything is great. The flaws that I have to say in here is probably because there isn't something so great to make up attach to the main characters."}
{"text": "The Marvel Universe has faced a variety of threats, whether descended from the cosmos or from the deep tunnels underneath their feet. Now it will face arguably its greatest challenge when the monsters of the MCU decide to take the earth for themselves in Monsters Unleashed.\n\nHow or why that happens is still a mystery, but that is how writer Cullen Bunn and an art team comprised of Steve McNiven, Lenil Yu, Adam Kubert, Salvador Larroca, and Greg Land want to keep things for the time being. While we don't know specifics, Marvel Editor-in-Cheif Axel Alonso told EW it will feature a who's who of Marvel creatures.\n\n\"If there ever were a monster who stood 10 stories high or taller and created mayhem in the Marvel Universe over last several decades, they're gonna be in the story.\" Editor Mark Paniccia echoes his sentiments and welcomed suggestions from the comics faithful.\n\n\"Our goal is to cram as many mammoth monsters of Marvel into Monsters Unleashed as will fit on the page. If you've got a personal favorite, chances are very good you'll see them causing some mayhem in this series. And if you're worried we'll forget one, don't be afraid to tweet at us @Marvel using the hashtag #MonstersUnleashed.\" For Bunn, this threat requires every hero that the universe can muster, as even one of these things is enough to take down a premiere superhero squad, nonetheless all of them at once. Plus, it doesn't just feature villains, as heroes like Devil Dinosaur and the beloved Guardian Groot are also featured in the battle against their friends and teammates, a battle which is shown briefly in the first promotional art from Steve McNiven.\n\n\"It's an all hands on deck situation,\" Bunn says. \"Imagine something like the Hulk, only much bigger. With the destructive force those creatures have, the heroes will have to mobilize much more quickly. The heroes find themselves very quickly in a situation where they have no downtime, they have no chance to take a breath. They're moving constantly against what are essentially cataclysmic threats over and over again.\" \"Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, Don Heck, and Herb Trimpe – all of these guys created incredible monsters that we remember from my childhood,\" Alonso says. \"They're the equivalent of those Ray Harryhausen-type monsters, those rubber suits that thrill us. To see them coming back, and to take them seriously, it's a lot of fun.\" Each issue of Monsters Unleashed will be helmed by a different artistic talent, giving each volume its own unique identity, something that Alonso wants to make sure comes through in the final product."}

{"text": "The Pennsylvania Railroad Harsimus Branch Embankment, a massive sectional retaining wall that traverses six residential blocks between Fifth and Sixth Streets, is one of the few intact relics of the legendary Pennsylvania Road-arguable the largest, wealthiest, and most influential of several railroad companies that occupied Jersey City's landscape for nearly 150 years.\n\nDesigned by James J. Ferris, a prominent civil engineer and politician in Jersey City for whom a local high school is named (Ferris also supervised the piling and pouring of the Powerhouse's vast concrete foundation), the Embankment was erected form 1901-1905 to replace an older iron and timer embankment that was deemed too low and unstable.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Railroad commissioned Ferris to design the elevated freight line on Sixth Avenue to bring seven railway lines through downtown Jersey City to Harsimus yard on the Hudson River. According to local historian John Gomez, \". . . Ferris made a conscious, successful attempt at integrating the massive structure into the surrounding residential streetscapes with as much elegance and beauty as one can give a stone bridge. The colossal granite and sandstone embankment soared segmentally - block by block, connected by steel bridges - past tenement windows, stables, warehouses and places of worship. Christened the Pennsylvania Railroad Stem Embankment, it stands as Ferris's engineering masterwork - and it turns out, his only surviving span.\"\n\n\nResidents of the quiet historic neighborhoods of Harsimus Cove and Hamilton Park, perfectly separated by the Embankment, had to adjust to this powerful structure. Around-the-clock steam locomotives carrying produce and live cattle cargo emerged westerly from the Pennsylvania Railroad Cut, traveled past tenement windows atop the 7-track Embankment, and led directly to the Harsimus Cove freight yards and waterfront wharves. Constructed of enormous sandstone and granite blocks, the Embankment reaches a breathtaking height of 27 feet at its western terminus near Brunswick Street. Each block-long section is 400 feet long and 100 feet wide. Gigantic plate girder bridges connected each segment but were dismantled in 1996 by Conrail and sold for scrap. Although no longer utilized, the Embankment is recognized as an engineering monument and was entered into the State Register of Historic Places in 1999.\n\nReference:\n\nGomez, John. \"End of the Line?\" Jersey Journal 3 August 2005.\n\nFor a full description with photographs of Pennsylvania Railroad\n\nHarsimus Branch Embankment, click on the link below:\n\nPennsylvania Railroad\n\nHarsimus Branch Embankment\n\nJersey City Landmarks Conservancy website."}

The two used to be close friends (even after that time they both dated John Mayer), but after that 2013 Rolling Stone article seen around the world, things went south. Here's a quick refresher from the article:\n\n\"For years, I was never sure if we were friends or not,\" she says. \"She would come up to me at awards shows and say something and walk away, and I would think, 'Are we friends, or did she just give me the harshest insult of my life?'\" Then last year, the other star crossed a line. \"She did something so horrible,\" Swift says. \"I was like, 'Oh, we're just straight-up enemies.'

{"text": "Now that the world's most successful crowdfunding ever has completely fallen apart, the question becomes how viable DAO structures can be. Even though The DAO has failed miserably, the concept is still very much alive. Lessons have been learned, albeit they were rather expensive ones for some people.\n\nThe DAO Is Done For But The Concept Is Not\n\nIt has become apparent The DAO – which is the world's largest crowdfunding campaign to date – is pretty much done for. Not only did assailants manage to abuse the code several times, but there is also a negative aftermath to deal with. Coinmarketcap has removed DAO tokens from their listings, and Poloniex advises users to exchange DAO for Ethereum.\n\nThere are a lot of valuable lessons to be learned from this US$150m screw-up, though. First of all, the crowdfunding campaign was a big success, but the creators also allowed investors to pull their funds back out if they had second thoughts. Some of them did, whereas others kept the faith in the concept.\n\nNow that users can exchange their DAO tokens for Ethereum once again, most people will have lost little to no funds. It is sad to see this big future for cryptocurrency projects fail in the end, but the DAO concept is still very much alive today. Hopefully, we will not see another mega project such as The DAO V2 run by the same Slock.it team, though.\n\nGranted, the failed project puts a spin on how useful a decentralized autonomous organization can be. Many people seem to forget this innovative technology is way ahead of its time, and there will be many kinks that need to be worked out along the way. That doesn't mean the entire concept is dead in the water all of a sudden, though, as a decentralized autonomous organization is still a viable future.\n\nThe biggest gripe people have right now is the Slock.it team themselves. Not only did they raise US$150m for a project they knew as flawed from day one, they are also tightly related to the Robin Hood Group. These self-professed white-hat hackers have been involved in retrieving Ethereum funds stolen from the DAO, as well as the ETC funds obtained in the process. However, they tried to dump the Ethereum Classic coins a few days ago, and were caught red-handed. These people have very little to no honest intentions, that much is certain.\n\nImage credit 1\n\nIf you liked this article follow us on Twitter @themerklenews and make sure to subscribe to our newsletter to receive the latest bitcoin and altcoin price analysis and the latest cryptocurrency news."}
{"text": "Times public editor Margaret Sullivan has a post up taking Nate Silver to task for daring Joe Scarborough to a bet over who would win the election. Basically, she says making a bet like this diminishes the Times and he shouldn't have done it. That may be so. I don't know and don't really care.But she concludes with this line …\n\nWhen he came to work at The Times, Mr. Silver gained a lot more visibility and the credibility associated with a prominent institution. But he lost something, too: the right to act like a free agent with responsibilities to nobody's standards but his own.\n\nI say this as an admirer of Silver and the Times. But I think this is almost a demonstrably false assumption and a sign Sullivan doesn't fully grasp the politics and new media environment Silver operates in.\n\nI've been attacking those who've been attacking Silver lately and I know that probably makes me seem like I'm some Silver diehard or something. But the reason he's getting attacked so ferociously on the right now is precisely because he's viewed as being the standard for poll prognostication. And his 'odds', which make Obama an almost overwhelming favorite, are seen by Republicans as really really damaging.\n\nHere's what Sullivan doesn't get. There are 7 or 8 different organizations running different flavors of systematic presidential poll analysis right now. They range from Silver to sites like TPM and RCP and Pollster to academic political scientists. And they all show pretty much the same numbers that Silver's showing. But Silver's the one who has the public rep as the brainiac polling-meister so he's the one everybody's focused on — both Dems who want to believe his numbers (and who tend to favor more science/evidence based analysis) and Republicans who desperately want him to be wrong. That is almost the definition of public credibility, which is what the Times purchased when they made their deal with him.\n\nAgain, everybody is showing basically the same thing. But he's the lightning rod, pro and con.\n\nLike a number of media personalities/experts (and I mean that in a positive sense), Silver is not really reliant on the Times at all. He's his own brand. In the political realm he built it in the 2008 cycle (he obviously had a baseball sabermetrics rep before that).\n\nI don't think there's any question the Times gained considerably more than he did in the bargain. That's why I suspect they're paying him quite a lot of money and he was able to negotiate a deal in which the entire 538 franchise is still his. He's just leasing it to them."}
{"text": "Save their lives, or build a border wall?\n\nDonald Trump would like for the United States to spend $1.1 billion less on HIV-treatment programs in sub-Saharan Africa, and $524 million less on contraception for the global poor.\n\nOn the plus side, these cuts will make it easier to finance the president's border wall, which he hopes to spend $1.6 billion on in 2018.\n\nOn the downside:\n\nAt least one million people will die in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere, researchers and advocates said on Tuesday, if funding cuts proposed by the Trump administration to global public health programs are enacted.\n\n\n… With a huge share of Africa's population reaching sexual maturity in the next four years, the virus could again imperil much of the continent if fewer people are treated, said Brian Honermann, deputy director at amfAR, a foundation that invests in AIDS research.\n\n\nAIDS treatment not only keeps people alive but prevents them from spreading the virus to others, Mr. Honermann noted. \"If you cut the funding by this much, I think there's a real risk we will backslide, and a whole lot more people will become infected,\" he said.\n\nThese cuts almost certainly won't happen. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (Pepfar) — America's primary program for funding HIV treatment — is one of George W. Bush's (only) signature achievements, and enjoys strong, bipartisan support.\n\nSo, it's tempting to dismiss these eye-popping death-toll estimates as irrelevant — ultimately, the Trump budget is just Mick Mulvaney's (sloppily executed) math homework, not an actual governing document.\n\nBut such nonchalance is wrongheaded. And not only because Trump's budget functions as an expression of his (monstrous) values.\n\nThe president may be unlikely to cut $1 billion from AIDS treatment, but his budget makes it clear that he will not be adding any more money to such programs. And that latter fact is about as morally objectionable as the first.\n\nThe Global Fund estimates that every $100 million invested in HIV treatment saves about 133,000 lives. Currently, the United States — the wealthiest country in human history — spends $6 billion annually on AIDS programs. The Pentagon recently spent $125 billion on (what its own internal study deemed) \"administrative waste.\"\n\nOur nation could easily afford to save hundreds of thousands more people from preventable deaths. When we choose instead to cut taxes for the rich — and/or spend $1 trillion on the F-35 — we are choosing to let them die."}
{"text": "America's biggest tech companies have united to criticize new digital surveillance laws proposed in the UK. In evidence submitted to the committee assessing the legislation, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Twitter warned that the UK government's actions could have \"far reaching implications.\" The companies anticipate that \"other countries will emulate\" the proposed Investigatory Powers Bill, which includes controversial measures such as forcing ISPs to keep a record of every citizen's internet activity for the past year.\n\nThe Bill was introduced by the UK's home secretary Theresa May last year, who says it will help fight organized crime, terrorism, and cyberbullying. However, the Bill has been roundly criticized by industry experts for its potential overreach and vague language.\n\nThe bill could force tech companies to weaken their encryption\n\nIn the US tech firms' evidence, they note that the Bill could potentially force companies to introduce backdoors in their encryption. Although May has stated that the UK government does not wish to weaken encryption, the Bill itself includes \"obligations relating to the removal of electronic protection applied by a relevant operator to any communication or data.\" Facebook, Google, Microsoft, et al note that they have \"concerns\" about this wording, and would rather the Bill state explicitly that no company will be required \"to weaken or defeat its security measures.\"\n\nApple has also criticized the legislation\n\nSimilar worries have been expressed by Apple, which submitted its own evidence on the Investigatory Powers Bill last month. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in November that the proposed legislation could have \"dire consequences\" if introduced. \"If you halt or weaken encryption, the people that you hurt are not the folks that want to do bad things. It's the good people,\" said Cook. \"The other people know where to go.\"\n\nThe reaction of US tech firms to the legislation echoes corporate outcry following the Snowden revelations. Companies then made it clear that they do not want to lose users' trust, and cannot be seen to be complicit with government surveillance. (Although past evidence suggests companies were happy to help spy agencies in the past as long as nobody knew about it.) \"The ultimate test we apply to each of the authorities in this Bill is whether they will promote and maintain the trust users place in our technology,\" write the tech giants in the evidence published on Thursday, adding that the current provisions are \"a step in the wrong direction.\"\n\nHowever, the terrorist attacks of 2015 — including those in Paris in November — have hardened the debate around surveillance and encryption, and the most recent signs suggest the UK government is still determined to push forward with the Bill. Discussion will continue, with the legislation scheduled to be voted on later this year."}
{"text": "NORMAN, Okla. -- Oklahoma receiver Dorial Green-Beckham has said that he will declare for the NFL draft, Sooners coach Bob Stoops said Tuesday.\n\nGreen-Beckham, who transferred from Missouri in April 2014 after several run-ins with the law, never played a down for the Sooners. He was not allowed to play this season after the NCAA denied the school's request for a waiver that would have made him eligible to play immediately.\n\nDorial Green-Beckham caught 59 passes for 883 yards and 12 touchdowns in 2013 before he was dismissed by Missouri and transferred to Oklahoma, where he did not play a down. Tim Heitman/USA TODAY Sports\n\n\"I knew that was something that could happen,\" Stoops said Tuesday. \"He had great character through here, did well in classes, worked hard for us.\n\n\"I believe in young people and helping them improve and move forward in a positive direction. Dorial contributed to us in a positive way.\"\n\nOne of college football's most explosive receivers in 2013, Green-Beckham had a breakout season for the Tigers with 59 receptions for 883 yards and 12 touchdowns as a sophomore. He was one of the nation's top recruits in the Class of 2012, ranking No. 3 in the ESPN150.\n\nESPN NFL Draft Insider Mel Kiper Jr. rates Green-Beckham as his fifth-highest receiver in his draft positional rankings, but believes that a full season at Oklahoma was best for him to transition to the NFL effectively. Scouts Inc. rates him 10th at receiver.\n\nHis admission to Oklahoma came with specific stipulations, including continued rehabilitation and drug testing, according to a source. Green-Beckham also was subject to a zero-tolerance policy that included any failed drug test.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 receiver was kicked out of Missouri's program after an initial suspension. His troubles included being investigated for allegedly pushing an 18-year-old female Missouri student down at least four stairs. No charges were filed, and the case was closed after the student and a roommate declined to press charges.\n\nGreen-Beckham also had two marijuana-related arrests during his time at Missouri.\n\nStoops also confirmed that defensive tackle Jordan Phillips will enter the draft after the redshirt sophomore tweeted his intentions to do so on New Year's Eve.\n\nPhillips, a 6-6, 334-pounder, had 38 tackles, including seven for losses, this season. Kiper also has Phillips rated fifth among defensive tackles in his position rankings.\n\nJake Trotter of ESPN.com and The Associated Press contributed to this report."}
{"text": "It didn't take long for some of President Obama's doubters to claim the long-awaited birth certificate posted online by the White House on Wednesday had been altered or might be a fake.\n\nBut a leading software expert says there's no doubt about its authenticity, and he dismisses claims of fraud as flat-out wrong.\n\nThe doubters have latched onto the idea that Adobe Illustrator — the premier program for computer graphic artists — \"reveals\" evidence of document manipulation in the Obama birth certificate. They note Illustrator reveals nine separate layers of the document, and claim it's \"proof\" the file has been altered.\n\nBut that's not so, says Jean-Claude Tremblay, a leading software trainer and Adobe-certified expert, who has years of experience working with and teaching Adobe Illustrator.\n\n\"You should not be so suspicious about this,\" Tremblay told FoxNews.com, dismissing the allegations.\n\nMore On This... Obama Birth Certificate Moved to More Secure Location Months Ago\n\nHe said the layers cited by doubters are evidence of the use of common, off-the-shelf scanning software — not evidence of a forgery. \"I have seen a lot of illustrator documents that come from photos and contain those kind of clippings—and it looks exactly like this,\" he said.\n\nTremblay explained that the scanner optical character recognition (OCR) software attempts to translate characters or words in a photograph into text. He said the layers cited by the doubters shows that software at work – and nothing more.\n\n\"When you open it in Illustrator it looks like layers, but it doesn't look like someone built it from scratch. If someone made a fake it wouldn't look like this,\" he said.\"Some scanning software is trying to separate the background and the text and splitting element into layers and parts of layers.\"\n\nTremblay also said that during the scanning process, instances where the software was unable to separate text fully from background led to the creation of a separate layer within the document. This could be places where a signature runs over the line of background, or typed characters touch the internal border of the document.\n\n\"I know that you can scan a document from a scanner most of the time it will appear as one piece, but that doesn't mean that there's no software that's doing this kind of stuff,\" he said, adding that it's really quite common.\n\n\"I'd be more afraid it'd be fake if it was one in piece. It would be harder to check if it's a good one if it's a fake,\" Tremblay said."}
{"text": "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's monitoring of social media services could be a threat to civil liberties and online free speech, several lawmakers said during a hearing Thursday.\n\nAccording to a report by a civil liberties group called the Electronic Privacy Information Center, or EPIC, DHS paid more than $11 million to General Dynamics for a system to keep an eye on Facebook and Twitter public posts, as well as comment threads on major news websites.\n\nEPIC's report found that the system watches public social media posts for comments that \"adversely reflect\" on the government, and for responses to proposed government plans. EPIC tried to get information about the deal through a Freedom of Information request, but was denied. It then filed a successful lawsuit and was granted access to the specifics by DHS.\n\nDuring Thursday's hearing, congressmen from both sides of the asile grilled DHS about the General Dynamics deal as revealed by EPIC's lawsuit. One Democratic representative, Jackie Speier of California, said she was \"deeply troubled\" by the arrangement.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security \"is not a political operation,\" she added.\n\nPennsylvania Republican Representative Patrick Meehan also expressed doubts about the plan.\n\n\"My guess is that the average American has no problem with other private individuals reading their commentary in online writings and postings in open forums, but may feel a bit of unease knowing the federal government may be doing the same thing,\" said Meehan.\n\nReps. Speier and Meehan elaborated on their concerns about the deal in a letter sent to DHS Thursday.\n\n\"Although there are clear advantages to monitoring social media to identify possible threats to our security, there are also privacy and civil liberties concerns implicit in this activity,\" they wrote. \"With its domestic mission, the Department of Homeland Security needs to be mindful of the rights of the citizens of our country to express themselves online. Not only should guidance issued by the Department permit analysts to do their jobs identifying threats, but it should also be stringent enough to protect the rights of our citizens.\"\n\nDHS Chief Privacy Officer Mary Ellen Callahan defended the agency.\n\nAccording to Callahan, DHS' social media activity has been limited to public outreach, gaining \"situational awareness\" when disasters strike and helping law enforcement. She added that privacy rules meant they could only collect information on public officials and during \"life or death\" situations.\n\n\"It is the what, not the who, being identified,\" said Callahan.\n\nWould you feel comfortable with the government monitoring your public social media posts?

{"text": "De Havilland Mosquito FB Mk VI\n\nSomewhat ironically, considering that the aircraft had first been developed as an unarmed bomber, the most numerous variant of the Mosquito was the FB Mk VI fighter bomber, which combined the eight guns of the F Mk II with the capacity to carry a useful bomb load.\n\nWork first began on the FB Mk VI in the summer of 1941. The first prototype flew on 1 June 1942, and production aircraft began to appear in February 1943. Early aircraft were powered by 1,460 hp Merlin 21 or 23 engines, later replaced by the 1,635 hp Merlin 25.\n\nThe FB Mk VI was armed with four .303in machine guns and four 20mm cannon, just as had been planned for the day fighter version. It could carry two 500lb bombs in the rear half of its bomb bay (the front half was used by the cannons). Additionally the Mk VI had two wing mounting points that allowed it to carry either 50 gallon drop tanks, or two more 500lb bombs, for a total bomb load of 2,000lbs. Fully armed the FB Mk VI had an effective range of over 1000 miles.\n\nLate in 1944 the Mosquito FB Mk VI was used to carry up to eight rocket projectiles. The first Mosquito attack with RPs was carried out in October 1944.\n\nThe FB Mk VI entered service with No. 418 Squadron, which received its first aircraft on 11 May 1943. Eventually it equipped 26 RAF squadrons, seeing service over Europe and the Far East as well as from bases on Malta. It was also used by Coastal Command on anti-shipping duties. The FB Mk VI carried out some of the most daring Mosquito raids of the war, amongst them the famous attack on Amiens Prison on 18 February 1944.\n\nMosquito Aces of World War 2, Andrew Thomas. This volume concentrates on the fighter variants of the Mosquito, looking at their role as a defensive fighter, both over Britain and overseas and their use during the D-Day invasion to protect the fleet. Thomas also looks at the career of the Mosquito as a night intruder over Germany, where it became the scourge of the German night fighters, often being blamed for losses miles from the nearest Mosquito.\n\nHow to cite this article: Rickard, J (15 April 2007), De Havilland Mosquito FB Mk VI, http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_mosquito_VI.html\n\nHelp - F.A.Q. - Contact Us - Search - Recent - About Us - Subscribe in a reader - Join our Google Group - Cookies"}

He is prepared to make an all-cash offer.\n\nTrump is proving to be serious in his efforts to buy the Bills, who are on the market after Wilson died in March. Trump was previously dismissed by critics as using the Bills' sale as a publicity stunt.\n\nThe Pegulas have been low-key throughout the sale process in regards to their interests in purchasing the Bills.\n\nThe Bills most recently were valued by Forbes at $870 million but are expected to sell for at least $1 billion, partly because NFL teams rarely go on the market.\n\nMorgan Stanley's selection of Trump and the Pegulas comes after prospective groups were asked to submit non-binding bids by Tuesday.\n\nA Toronto group that includes rocker Jon Bon Jovi was expected to submit a bid. It's not known if that group has been selected to advance.\n\nThe deadline Tuesday was regarded as a soft one, meaning other interested parties can still submit bids until a prospective owner is identified. The time, however, is growing shorter for outside groups to become involved.\n\nThe next step is for groups who have been approved to advance is to meet with both Morgan Stanley and members of the estate to obtain the franchise's financial information. Bills President Russ Brandon also is expected to make a presentation to prospective bidders.\n\nOnce that is done in the coming weeks, groups will then be asked to submit formal bids. The bidding process is unsealed, meaning Wilson's estate will have the ability to ask groups to increase their bids.\n\nThough no timetable has been established by Morgan Stanley, a prospective owner is could be identified by as early as Labor Day and presented to NFL owners for approval during league meetings in early October."}

These patterns will be similar to what we already see on the mobile devices these days. Based on their patterns, they will then be assigned four random themes, being prompted to select one image from 30 in each.\n\nAfter they log in to their accounts, the users will have to enter their username and draw the pattern lock at first. The next step would contain a series of 16 themed images. Out of those 16 images, two of the images will be their selected images. From rest of the fourteen images, six images will be associated distractors and eight images will be random decoys.\n\nAfter a user has already identified these two images among 16, that would lead to the generated eight digits random code generated on the top or left edges of the login panel. This random generated code has to be used by the user to access their banking information.\n\nInitial tests Over GOTPass system have shown that this whole working procedure is easier for the users to remember, thus making the whole login process easier. One the other hand, security analytics have showed that just eight of the 690 attempted hackings were genuinely successful while further 15 attempts were achieved through a mere coincidence.\n\nIn order for online security to be strong, it needs to be difficult to hack, and we have demonstrated that using a combination of graphics and one-time password can achieve that.\n\n– Said Dr Maria Papadaki, Lecturer in Network Security at Plymouth University, Britain and director of the PhD research study.\n\nDid you like the concept behind GOTPass?

Deputies were checking on a house party when they were reportedly confronted by a pit bull.\n\nAt some point, Garcia came outside to check on the dog, which had bitten a deputy on the leg, LASD said. Deputies opened fire on the dog, and one of the bullets may have ricocheted off the pavement and struck the boy.\n\n\"It appears that as we are investigating this and looking at the evidence, that within that first six to eight feet, of where the shooting occurred with the dog, there are skip rounds in the apron of the driveway,\" LASD Capt. Chris Bergner said at a Thursday morning news conference. \"We believe that when the individual came out from behind the building, which was approximately 40 feet away from where the shooting occurred, he may have been struck by one of the skip rounds. And it is what we're calling an extremely, extremely unfortunate incident.\"\n\nGarcia was taken to a hospital with gunshot wounds, where he was pronounced dead.\n\nFamily says Armando Garcia was just \"protecting a dog\" when he was accidentally killed by deputies' ricocheting bullets #Palmdale @CBSLA pic.twitter.com/lBapBJBiZ2 — JASMINE VIEL (@jasmineviel) June 22, 2017\n\n\"My nephew was trying to save the dog because the cops started shooting at the dog,\" the victim's aunt Amber Alcantar told CBS2.\n\nNick Perez, a friend of the victim, told CBS2 they had been in the house drinking. Perez said he passed out in his car and awoke to find deputies surrounding his vehicle.\n\n\"And then I see my homie bleeding,\" Perez said.\n\nThe deputy that was bitten by the dog was also struck by a ricocheting bullet. That deputy was taken to a hospital for treatment, Bergner said.\n\nThe dog was shot three or four times, L.A. County animal control confirmed.

{"text": "Office for Nuclear Regulation approves design for new reactor at Horizon Nuclear Power's plant at Wylfa, Anglesey\n\nPlans for a major new nuclear power station in Wales have taken a crucial step forward as UK regulators approved the project.\n\nThe Office for Nuclear Regulation and two other government bodies gave the green light on Thursday for the Japanese reactor design for Horizon Nuclear Power's plant at Wylfa, marking the end of a five-year regulatory process.\n\nDuncan Hawthorne, Horizon's chief executive, said: \"This is a huge milestone for Horizon and a major leap forward for us in bringing much-needed new nuclear power to the UK.\"\n\nAttention will now turn to financing the Hitachi-backed project on the island of Anglesey, which was the site of Britain's oldest nuclear plant until it closed two years ago.\n\nDuring a visit by UK ministers to Japan last December, it emerged that London and Tokyo were considering public financing for Wylfa. This would be a significant break with the UK government's previous approach.\n\nHitachi has already spent £2bn on development. Last week the consortium said it needed a financial support package by mid-2018 or it could stop funding development.\n\nJapan's Toshiba has bowed out of the race to build nuclear plants in the UK, confirming last week that a South Korean nuclear firm had been chosen to buy its venture to build a plant in Cumbria.\n\nIf Horizon is successful with Wylfa, it hopes to build a second new nuclear power station at Oldbury in Gloucestershire. The plants will use Hitachi's advanced boiling water reactor (ABWR), which has been approved for use at Wylfa.\n\nThe Welsh plant would have a capacity of 2.7GW, similar to the 3.2GW of the nuclear power station that EDF is building at Hinkley Point in Somerset.\n\nPower from mini nuclear plants 'would cost more than from large ones' Read more\n\nMark Foy, chief nuclear inspector at the Office for Nuclear Regulation, said: \"The completion of the generic design assessment of the UK ABWR is a significant step in our regulation of the overall process to construct this type of reactor in the UK, ensuring that the generic design meets the highest standards of safety that we expect in this country.\"\n\nMinisters said last week that nuclear can and would compete with rival technologies, such as offshore wind, the price of which has reached a record low.\n\nRichard Harrington, energy minister, said it was \"very naive\" and \"very simplistic\" to suggest that because the guaranteed price for wind was lower there would be no more nuclear projects."}

Inspired by her prayer, Clark named it the Hallelujah Diamond. She plans to keep it.\n\nThe diamond, which is the largest found at the park so far this year, is about the size of a pinto bean, says park interpreter Waymon Cox. \"And it's the largest one found since April 16, 2014, when a 6.19-carat white diamond, named the Limitless Diamond, was found at the park,\" he said, according to a park press release.\n\nIt's the 122nd diamond found at Crater of Diamonds this year.\n\nVisitors get to keep what they find at the state park's 37.5-acre search field, which is named for an ancient eruption that scattered the area with gems.\n\nThe area, which became a state park in 1972, is the only public site in the world where -- for a small fee -- anyone can dig for diamonds and keep them.\n\nIt's not clear how much the diamond is worth, and park officials aren't trained to appraise them, according to the park website. But Oklahoman Tara Clymer sold a 3.85-carat diamond she found at the park last year for $20,000.\n\n50 states, 50 spots: Natural wonders\n\nPark staff regularly plow the area to bring more diamonds to the surface for visitors to discover.\n\nThe 40.23-carat Uncle Sam, the nation's largest diamond, was found in 1924, and the \"perfect\" 3.03-carat Strawn-Wagner diamond was found in 1990. The Strawn-Wagner Diamond was cut in 1997 by the renowned diamond firm Lazare Kaplan International of New York. The now 1.09-carat diamond is on display at the park visitor center.\n\nThe park stretches for more than 900 acres along the Little Missouri River, but the diamond field is the main attraction. More than 75,000 diamonds have been discovered there since farmer John Huddleston discovered gems on what was then his property in 1906."}

Its companion web series Dexter Early Cuts aired in the years 2009, 2010, and 2012.\n\nList of Novels\n\nTelevision Series\n\nThere are eight seasons of DEXTER, which originally aired from 2006 to 2013. In the TV series, Dexter is a forensic blood spatter analyst who works for the fictitious Miami Metro Police Department. In his spare time, he is a vigilante serial killer who targets other murderers who have evaded the justice system. He follows a code of ethics taught to him in childhood by his adoptive father, Harry, referred to as \"The Code\" or \"The Code of Harry.\" It hinges on certain principles, which include: Dexter can only kill people after finding conclusive evidence that they are guilty of murder, and he must not get caught.\n\nAdaptation from Novels\n\nSeason 1 is largely based on the first novel, Darkly Dreaming Dexter (2004), but the following seasons veered away from the rest of the book series. In the television program, Dexter was played by Michael C. Hall, who won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Series or Drama in 2009. He was also portrayed as a youth by Devon Graye, Dominic Janes, Nicholas Vigneau, and Maxwell Huckabee.\n\nThere are notable distinctions between many of the characters in the Dexter novels and on Showtime's television adaptation. As can happen with books that are adapted into movies or TV series, changes were made that influenced the course of the storyline. These changes included the major characters' attributes, deaths (or introductions), along with miscellaneous information (such as their names, ages, addresses, relationships, etc.).\n\nContents show]\n\nCharacters in the Novels\n\nMajor\n\nNon-Existent\n\nCharacters in the TV Series\n\nMajor\n\nDexter Morgan - Dexter's personality differs quite a bit between the TV series and the novels.

{"text": "On 26 October 1520 a genial young man named Charles, who was already King of Spain, Archduke of Austria, Duke of Burgundy, and Lord of the Netherlands, was also crowned as Holy Roman Emperor Charles V.\n\nThis guy, whom I am prone to call The Human Chin, had basically inherited a big chunk of the planet, and this one chin man \"brought together under his rule extensive territories in western, central, and southern Europe, and the Spanish colonies in the Americas and Asia. As a result, his domains spanned nearly four million square kilometers and were the first to be described as \"the empire on which the sun never sets\". The title of Emperor was basically icing on the cake.\n\nCharles was born 24 February 1500, the eldest son of Philip the Handsome and Joanna of Castile. This means he was Katharina of Aragon's nephew, and Mary I's cousin, and he would later give Henry VIII a hard row to hoe over the English king's attempt to divorce his Spanish wife in favor of Anne Boleyn. In fact, he would keep meddling in English politics for the next several decades, culminating in his son's marriage to Mary I.\n\nHowever, that bedevilment was still years in the future when Charles was crowned, so Henry VIII was probably pleased as punch to have an Imperial in-law. In fact, Charles was betrothed to Mary, his cousin and future daughter-in-law, for a while. Ah, the amusing incest of the royal families!\n\nAnyway, Charles went on to have many, MANY historical things happen during his reign that did not (surprising as it is to a Tudor historian like myself) involve either Henry VIII or his children. Charles's armies humbled several powerful men, including the King of France, Pope Clement VII, the Duke of Cleves, and the Ottoman Empire's Suleiman the Magnificent.\n\nStrangely, for such a powerful man he was not very power-hungry. When he was in his early 50s, Charles started abdicating his various thrones and giving rule of his territories to his eldest son and his younger brother. Charles retreated from court life to live in seclusion at the monastery of Yuste in Extremadura, where lived alone in a small room with multiple clocks on every wall. Although reclusive in person, the former Emperor maintained correspondence with heirs and acted as a sort of unofficial advisor. Charles died six years after he retired, on 21 September 1558, from what is believed to have been malaria. His mortal remains now lie in the Royal Pantheon of the Monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial."}
{"text": "RICHMOND, Virginia (Reuters) - In a case that could have an impact on the November presidential election, the Virginia Supreme Court heard arguments on Tuesday over a Republican lawsuit challenging the blanket restoration of voting rights for 206,000 felons by Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe.\n\nTerry McAuliffe stands onstage during a campaign rally in Dale City, Virginia, October 27, 2013. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo\n\nIf upheld, McAuliffe's order could help tip Virginia, a swing state where the vote is traditionally close in presidential elections, in favor of presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\nLawyers for leaders in the Republican-controlled state legislature argued that McAuliffe exceeded his authority by restoring voting rights en masse, rather than on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\"Never in Virginia's 240-year history has a governor exercised clemency power en masse,\" Charles Cooper, an attorney for the plaintiffs, told the court.\n\nCooper said history and the language of the state constitution clearly indicate that the restoration of a felon's rights must be done individually.\n\nBut Stuart Raphael, Virginia's solicitor general, said nothing in the constitution restricts McAuliffe's authority to restore such rights across the board, even though no governor has done so in the past.\n\n\"If he has the power,\" Raphael said, \"he has the power.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs have asked the court to block McAuliffe's action, which also allows felons to serve on juries and hold public office.\n\nThe court did not say on Tuesday when it may issue a decision in the case.\n\nAlmost 12,000 felons have registered to vote since McAuliffe's April 22 executive action, the state elections board said. Many of the convicts benefiting from the order are African-Americans or Latinos, two groups that have voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates in the past.\n\nDemocrat Barack Obama won Virginia in 2012 by about 150,000 votes and in 2008 by about 235,000 votes.\n\nBefore the order, felons had to petition the governor individually to restore their voting rights. Virginia is one of four states whose constitutions permanently disenfranchise felons but allow the governor to restore voting rights, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a non-partisan civil liberties group.\n\nMcAuliffe and other Democrats have said the restoration of rights to felons who have served their sentences and completed probation is long overdue.\n\nThe McAuliffe administration has refused to release the names of felons whose rights have been restored, a decision that drew criticism on Tuesday from Justice William Mims.\n\n\"I cannot understand why a document of such importance has been shielded from litigants and the citizens of Virginia,\" he said."}
{"text": "Not long after I got back from my recent trip to Brazil, I called some economists to gain a better understanding of where the country stood economically. To me, Rio de Janeiro felt a little like Shanghai: there was plenty of high-end shopping in neighborhoods like Ipanema — and plenty of poverty in the favelas, or slums. There was also a lot in between. What is most striking to a visitor is how many middle-class citizens there seem to be. Cars were everywhere; traffic jams, I've come to believe, are a sign of a growing middle class. It means people have enough money to buy automobiles.\n\nWhat I saw was no illusion. Though its starting point was quite extreme, Brazil is a country that has seen income inequality drop over the last decade. Unemployment is at near record lows. And the growth of the middle class is quite stunning. By most estimates, upward of 40 million people have been pulled out of poverty in the last decade; extreme poverty, says the government, has been reduced by 89 percent. Per capita income has continued to grow even as G.D.P. growth has slowed.\n\nNevertheless, the economists I spoke to were uniformly bearish about the short-term future of the Brazilian economy. They pointed, for starters, to that slowdown in G.D.P., which they didn't expect to pick up anytime soon. Despite the country's enormous economic gains since the beginning of this century, there has been very little accompanying productivity gains. Indeed, several economists told me that the main reason unemployment was so low was that the economy was terribly inefficient. Too much of the economy was in the hands of the state, I was told, and, what's more, it was a consumption-based economy that lacked necessary investment. And on and on. I got the sense that many economists believe that Brazil had been more lucky than good, and now its luck was running out. In a recent article about the Brazilian economy, The Economist put it starkly: \"The Deterioration,\" read its headline.\n\nAs I listened to the economists, though, I couldn't help thinking about our own economy. Our G.D.P. growth was more than 4 percent in the third quarter of 2013, and, of course, our productivity has risen relentlessly. But, despite the growth, unemployment only recently dropped below 7 percent. And the middle class is slowly but surely being eviscerated — thanks, at least in part, to those productivity gains. Income inequality has become a fact of life in the United States, and while politicians decry that fact, they seem incapable of doing anything about it. Which made me wonder: Whose economy runs better, really?"}
{"text": "One man's Fitbit device proved to be much more than a smart pedometer. After a 42-year old New Jersey man suffered a seizure at work one day, emergency room doctors used his Fitbit Charge HR to understand his heart rate history and decide how they could best treat him.\n\nUpon arrival at Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center in Camden, doctors noticed that the man had an atrial fibrillation, or an irregular, fast heartbeat. However, they weren't sure if it was a chronic condition or if it was caused by the seizure itself. Knowing this detail would determine how the doctors could treat the patient: If the arrhythmia was caused by the seizure, they could electrically cardiovert the patient to alleviate it. If it was chronic, the cardioversion could potentially cause a stroke. A stroke could also occur if the arrhythmia was left untreated.\n\nThat's where the man's Fitbit Charge HR came in. The doctors accessed the Fitbit app on his smartphone and found his average heart rate as recorded throughout the course of his fitness program. \"[It] revealed a baseline pulse rate between 70 and 80 beats/min, with an immediate persistent increase to a range of 140 to 160 bpm at the approximate time of the patient's seizure. The pulse rate remained elevated until administration of the diltiazem in the field,\" researchers wrote in the report that now appears in the Annals of Emergency Medicine.\n\nWith the information provided by the Fitbit, doctors were able to perform electrocardioversion since the arrhythmia was caused by the seizure. This is a pretty big deal, as it's the first time in history that a fitness tracker aided a medical decision made by professionals. It goes to show just how useful these devices can be not only for personal fitness reasons but in those (hopefully) rare instances when a medical condition comes up unexpectedly.\n\nMost wrist-bound trackers that feature optical heart rate monitors that are heavily scrutinized for their inaccuracies. By no means are these devices perfect, but fairly accurate heart rate monitors are proving themselves to be extremely useful in medically sensitive situations, and the Fitbit was key in this situation.\n\n\"Not all activity trackers measure heart rates, but this is the function of most value to medical providers,\" said Alfred Sacchetti, MD, FACEP of Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center. \"At present, activity trackers are not considered approved medical devices and use of their information to make medical decisions is at the clinician's own discretion. However, the increased use of these devices has the potential to provide emergency physicians with objective clinical information prior to the patient's arrival at the emergency department.\""}
{"text": "40 armed conflicts were active in 2014, the highest number of conflicts since 1999 and an increase of 18% when compared to the 34 conflicts active in 2013. New data from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) shows an increase in both the number of active conflicts but also in the number of battle-related deaths in these conflicts.\n\nIn 2014, the conflict in Syria and the escalating violence in countries like Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria and Ukraine, resulted in the highest yearly death toll in the post-Cold War period.\n\nIn an article in the Journal of Peace Research, the UCDP describes the recent trend in armed conflicts and battle-related deaths. During 2014, 40 armed conflicts, causing at least 25 battle-related deaths, were active. After the end of the Cold War, the number of conflicts in the world decreased substantially. However, for the last ten years the UCDP has recorded an uneven, yet clearly visible upward trend. In particular, the number of conflicts involving troops from other states, so called internationalized conflicts, has increased.\n\n'Nevertheless, this ten-year period is also where we find the year with the lowest number of active conflicts in the post-Cold War period', says Therése Pettersson, project leader at the UCDP. 'This illustrates the variations in the number of conflicts, and the difficulties of speaking of the long term trend'.\n\nThe number of conflicts which are defined as wars, resulting in at least 1000 battle-related deaths per year, has also increased, from six in 2013 to 11 in 2014. This represents the largest relative increase since the early 1960s. In recent years, the number of battle-related deaths has increased dramatically, largely due to the developments in Syria. In 2014, the UCDP recorded the highest number of battle-related deaths since the end of the Cold War.\n\n'Besides Syria, we have also seen violence escalating in several other conflicts, such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria and Ukraine', Therése Pettersson says. 'Even when excluding Syria, 2014 witnessed the highest number of battle-related deaths in 15 years'.\n\nOne positive development is that 10 peace agreements were signed during 2014, four more than in 2013.\n\n'We have for example seen a historic agreement signed in the Philippines', says Peter Wallensteen, UCDP's Director. 'Unfortunately, several attempts at negotiations in the most violent conflicts have collapsed, one reason being the tensions between the West and Russia'.\n\nExplore further: High number of fatalities despite unchanged level of armed conflicts\n\nMore information: Uppsala Conflict Data Program: www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/?languageId=3"}

If you still have doubts after having bought the suit, take it to your tailor and get his/her opinion on the fit.\n\nI say your tailor because you should have one. A tailor to call your own. As you purchase more investment pieces, frequent visits to the tailor is necessary. Retailers do not produce clothes that will custom fit your body. Their goal is to sell as much as possible, and so most clothes are mass-produced based on a pre-set garment \"mold\". Suits, dress shirts, skirts, jeans and pants/slacks should visit the tailor at least once, unless you're blessed with a perfect sized body.\n\nThis is an example of a bad fit. The extra fabric makes the look messy and unkempt. The sleeves are too long and eventually, the excess material will crease, which is NOT good.\n\nThe shirt in this look fits snugly, but it isn't too tight. The collar is tight, the tie is a good length and width, and the pants sit on the waist and isn't baggy so that it requires a belt. Your shirt doesn't need to be this snug. You can ask your tailor to make it a little looser if you prefer it that way. Fashion is about looking good, but it is also about feeling comfortable. You shouldn't feel like you cant breathe.\n\nLesson of the day : The tailor is your best friend. Going to a tailor may sound like a hassle (and pricey), but once you start getting compliments on the fit of your clothes, you'll definitely go back for more!\n\nGQ images.\n\nAdvertisements"}

Well, the SteamBoy Machine Team is looking to make your dreams come true, then.\n\n\"Announced earlier this year, Steam Machines are new entertainment systems targeted for play Steam games in the living room. SteamBoy takes a step forward, carrying the fun everywhere,\" the team explained.\n\n\"I think people will get shocked by SteamBoy potential and possibilities. SteamBoy is the first device that allows to play Steam games on the go, you will keep playing your favourite games at the bus, the office, the school or the doctor's waiting room,\" SteamBoy Machine Team said.\n\nThe video offers a brief look at the SteamBoy concept design, featuring the signature round track-pads of the Steam Controller, and the ABXY buttons of the Xbox, with the device's screen positioned right between them.\n\nThe project is not affiliated in any way with Valve, and it will be released in a market that's already struggling, as the handheld gaming devices are facing stiff competition from smartphones and tablets.\n\nThe SteamBoy, however, will have a distinct advantage over the Nintendo 3DS and Sony PlayStation Vita devices, coming with a wide array of available games right off the bat, the devs saying that the console will allow gamers to play nearly all the games that are currently available on Steam.\n\nThe hardware details of the device are not yet final, and it is not yet entirely clear whether the device will be able to play the games on its own or by using Steam's in-home streaming feature, but its prospective hardware specs indicate that it will be able to run quite a few games on its lonesome.\n\nThe developers have that they were looking to fit the SteamBoy with a quad-core CPU, 4GB of RAM, and a 32GB built-in memory card, as well as a 5-inch 16:9 touchscreen.\n\nThe SteamBoy will be able to connect to the Internet via both WiFi and 3G, which means that it will most likely also support Valve's game streaming service.\n\nDuring CES 2014, Valve announced that it had partnered with 12 hardware manufacturers in order to create several different models of Steam machines, specifically designed to play or stream Steam games using SteamOS. The first of the devices are expected to become commercially available in 2015.\n\nSteamBoy Machine Team did not reveal any prospective release date apart from sometime during 2015, or any details regarding the handheld console's pricing, but we'll keep you posted on any further developments."}

One exception is Gorim, who pays twice as much if the Warden is of the Dwarf Noble origin. The other one is Armaas in Awakening, who pays less.\n\nEach merchant charges differing prices, offering a fairly standard markup to the item's value for selling items to the party. Every merchant has its own markup, which is the same for all items traded with him or her.\n\nBuyback Edit\n\nItems bought within the session (before closing the trading screen) will show the price the item was bought for, allowing you to sell back the item for the same amount paid. Same for the sold items, which can be bought back for the price they were sold for. After the trading screen is closed, the items sold to the trader will be priced at the usual full price + markup, and the items bought from him will only yield the usual selling price.\n\nTips Edit\n\nLoot sold at either the Party Camp or Warden's Keep will remain in these merchants' respective inventories. Though the buyback list is cleared when the PC exits the merchant's window, the merchant will keep what was sold to them. This means that the PC can still buy items back, albeit at a higher price, as long as the merchant remains available. The party camp merchant will reset his inventory twice based on certain plot events. Consider using these merchants for items to recover some day, and avoid selling them extraneous junk, as this will make it more difficult to find useful items sold to them.\n\nThe party camp merchant also has the highest prices in the early game (50% markup), so avoid buying from him what you could find elsewhere.\n\nDragon Age: Origins Edit\n\nDragon Age: Origins - Awakening Edit\n\nLeliana's Song Edit\n\nMerchant City / Landmark Buy price Sell price Notable items Notes Bonny Lem Denerim Market District, Hideout, Chantry 105% 25% Accessories, Tomes, Armor, Potions\n\nWitch Hunt Edit\n\nMerchant City / Landmark Buy price Sell price Notable items Notes Sandal Circle Tower, Apprentice Quarters 115% 25% Accessories, Rune-crafting materials, Tomes Also provides enchanting services\n\nSee also Edit"}

After heading the charter school since it opened in 2005, Negron became a full-time math teacher in August, just as new standards were reshaping what students are supposed to learn.\n\nNegron taught math at I.S.164 before starting KIPP Infinity and kept one foot in the classroom while serving as principal. But even for a seasoned educator, he said, shifting to the Common Core standards is a challenge.\n\n\"This is so much messier than what I'm used to and comfortable with,\" said Negron, who will appear this evening on the panel at GothamSchools' event about the Common Core in math. \"It used to be, I'm going to teach you this strategy and you're going to use it until your eyes pop out.\"\n\nThis year, responding to the Common Core's emphasis on solving problems in multiple ways, he is asking students to master three approaches.\n\nThe old strategy, Negron said, was more immediately satisfying to teachers and students: Students could feel accomplished more quickly and teachers could more easily measure understanding.\n\nBut the old way did not guarantee that students actually grasped the underlying mathematical concepts, Negron said. \"The way we've done it has created some pretty good robots,\" he said.\n\nChalkbeat New York Stay on top of New York education news with our morning newsletter.

{"text": "Huge news on the coal export front just now. As Scott Learn at The Oregonian reports, \"Kinder Morgan drops plan to build coal export terminal at Port of St. Helens industrial park.\"\n\nKinder Morgan had been planning to export as much as 30 million tons of coal each year on the Columbia River from a site near Clatskanie, Oregon, but their plans ran into a buzz saw of opposition from local communities, environmental and health advocates, and even nearby industrial users. This morning they announced that they are officially abandoning their plans to build a coal terminal at Port Westward.\n\nSightline's research was instrumental in the debate. We published extensive documentation of Kinder Morgan's problems with coal dust at their terminals, as well as the company's lengthy rap sheet of fraud, illegal dumping, and lax safety. A month after we published our research, the utility PGE announced that it would not sublease its land at Port Westward to Kinder Morgan out of concern that the spread of coal dust would damage its gas turbines. Since then, the firm has struggled to configure its plans, but local opposition continued to mount while prices in Asia weakened.\n\nToday's news amounts to a huge victory for the Power Past Coal campaign. Of the six coal export terminals originally planned for the Northwest, three have now been withdrawn, in large part owing to an enormous backlash to the plans.\n\nPredictably, Kinder Morgan is trying to downplay the role of coal export opponents in thwarting the company's plans:\n\nKinder Morgan's Allen Fore attributed the decision not to seek permits for a coal export terminal to site logistics at the Port of St. Helens industrial park, not the controversy over coal. \"We looked at multiple options and different footprints, but we couldn't find one compatible with the facility we wanted to construct,\" Fore said.\n\nYet the firm's statement is revealing. Kinder Morgan had a specific project design that they presented to the public. After PGE rejected the plan—out of very justifiable objection to Kinder Morgan's inability to contain coal dust—it had to go back to the drawing board. Having lost the element of surprise, they were met with opposition at every turn.\n\nFind this article interesting? Please consider making a gift to support our work.\n\nKinder Morgan says, cryptically, that they are, \"still looking for coal export sites in the Northwest,\" though they won't name specific sites.\n\nPostscript 5/14/13: A reader points out that this is actually Kinder Morgan's second failed coal terminal project this year.

{"text": "Kurt bought this guitar from Chris Cobb of Real Guitars in San Francisco, CA. It is one of only two known 1960's Mark IV Gospels. The other is owned by Mosrite founder's daughter Michelle Moseley. A small number of these were reissued in Japan and usually sell on ebay for around $1000.\nThis is perhaps the most auctioned off Cobain guitar to date. The initial auction estimate was $75,000. It was initially auctioned on April 27, 2004 at the Dallas Guitar Show by Odyssey/Heritage Auctions. At the 2004 auction the closing price was $117,500. The second auction ended on April 14, 2006. The closing price was $131,450.\nFrom the Press Release\n\"This instrument is unusual in a couple of ways. It is the only known example of a Mark IV style Mosrite Gospel model. While Kurt owned and smashed many cheap (usually Univox) copies of Mosrite guitars during his career, this was one of only two actual Mosrites he owned. (The other was damaged and given away.) It was also one of his favorite guitars, which saved it from the usual fate of the instruments he used for live performances. Kurt purchased the guitar in San Francisco in 1990. \"According to Earnie [Bailey], 'Kurt had only one Gospel, and this is a beyond rare guitar. At the time Kurt died, I was secretly working with Loretta Mosley to build Kurt a lefty Gospel... in some cool color.' Unfortunately, Kurt passed away as Earnie was gathering photos to send to Mosrite of Kurt's original. 'Loretta sent me a nice letter after it ended, as she had recently lost Semie (husband, founder of Mosrite) and was now running Mosrite on her own... she had sent me some sales literature of another Gospel, but could find no history of ever having made one based on the Mark IV guitar.'\" (Quote reprinted from www.kurtsequipment.com.) Kurt had painted the very small Mosrite dot markers with white-out to make them more visible in a live setting. Although the current owner removed this simple modification, residue is still visible on the instrument. This is a factory right handed instrument, so it was modified for Kurt with a strap button added to the treble side horn, and the original metal string guide has been flipped to allow it to be strung left handed. The original case bears the words 'NIRVANA' and 'Fuck Elvis' in white paint which, while painted over with the same white paint, are still visible on inspection. Est. 250,000-up.\"\nVideo of Kurt rehearsing with the Gospel.\nDownload high-resolution photographs here ."}

Blisterpod and Young Wolf are great 1-drops that recur, giving great value in an Aristocrats deck. Kitchen Finks recurs itself, and provides life gain, which can make the Burn matchup easier. It's also part of the Merlia combo. Sprouting Thrinax may be hard on mana, but the pay-off is a total of 7 P/T across 4 bodies!\n\nWhile the Saccers count is low, the aim is to flood the board and CoCo/CoC for them as required. Varolz, the Scar-Striped gives us a grindy clock, and gives use to our dead Sac Fodders. Viscera Seer is key to the Melira combo, and can help us draw into better stuff.\n\nThe addition of Chord helps us dig for the specific piece we need for the Melira combo, or even the Aristocrats combo. We have enough cheap drops to pay for Convoke to get a 3-drop for pretty cheap. Collected Company gives us a big tempo swing, and our 28 creature count is plenty to hit 2 creatures the majority of the time.\n\nI opted for Terminate and Abrupt Decay, as any low P/T creatures we face, we can chump with our Sac Fodder, so our removal needs to hit troublesome cards, which Lightning Bolt may not be able to hit.\n\nThe addition of the Melira combo really fits our deck well, as it can be formed it more ways than the Abzan CoCo lists. With Blood Artist or Zulaport Cutthroat out, it will also kill our opponents outright.\n\nThe land base is very simple. I basically took Jund's land base, removed Raving Ravine (as having early untapped mana is crucial in early game to set up), and tweaked it to favour Green. Kessig Wolf Run provides us with a late game option to push through and provide a decent clock.\n\nOverall, the biggest and most common weakness is Path to Exile if we don't have a Saccer out, since the Sac Fodder triggers from dying."}

That's especially important when one is pitching a plan on the economic development of Quebec.\n\nIn the case of the Arctic Circle Assembly in Reykjavik, Iceland last week, where Mr. Couillard spoke in English only, no simultaneous translation was available.\n\nThe former prime minister of France delivered his remarks in English as did the president of Iceland and a Norwegian minister, Mr. Couillard noted.\n\n\"With all due respect, I think my colleague is exaggerating,\" Mr. Couillard told the National Assembly in response to a question from Coalition Avenir Québec leader François Legault, who was on the attack, saying the premier \"failed to live up to his responsibilities as a representative of the Quebec nation.\"\n\n\"There are two angles when it comes to language: expression and comprehension. Here's a little challenge for him; go to the London and New York financial circles and pitch your remarkable economic plan … in French only.\n\n\"Let's see how that goes.\"\n\nIt was Mr. Legault's second blast at Mr. Couillard on the subject. The first was Saturday at a CAQ policy convention.\n\nWednesday, Mr. Legault went at it again, saying in Question Period that it's the duty of every politician in the legislature to promote French in their official functions.\n\nHe said Mr. Couillard's initial explanation that everyone in the world already knows Quebecers speak French is not good enough and shows Mr. Couillard is \"naive or, worse, oblivious to his responsibilities to the Quebec nation.\"\n\nHe called on Mr. Couillard to recognize his mistake and promise not to do it again.\n\nBut Mr. Couillard countered by saying he hopes Mr. Legault does not consider himself somehow \"superior\" in the business of defending French.\n\nHe said what Mr. Legault is neglecting to mention is that when Mr. Couillard was in China, he delivered all his speeches in French because translation was available and that numerous former premiers, including Parti Québécois ones, stuck to English on certain occasions.\n\n\"I submit the following hypothesis,\" Mr. Couillard said,\"when we make important remarks, especially those involving the economic development of Quebec, it's usually a good thing to make sure everyone understands what we are saying.\"\n\nPostmedia News"}

I am currently in my sophomore year in a university in New Jersey studying Communications and Sociology.I was given a generous scholarship to attend and have tried to study biology and music but decided neither of those would support my plans for a future career. Deciding my major was very difficult for me because I love to learn about everything and have a wide variety of interests. As I wrote \"wide variety\" I had a dirty joke in mind but felt too embaressed to write it. That examplifies my personality very well because I am very excited by sexual things, but still very shy about it. I love to participate in team sports and play outside. One of my favorite things to do is hike 🙂 I get so excited by being outside and going to new and beautiful places! My dream is to be able to work around the world and see all that there is to see! Although I did do this first time video I am very spiritual and I love God and Jesus. I believe that the love of God is the most pure form of love and I am grateful to him for any good thing I have. My dedication in life is to be kind to everyone I meet whether they are a stranger, someone close to me, or someone who has hurt me. I hope that my career will reflect my desire to bring people happiness and comfort. I am very excited to see what I can do for the world. I have one brother and one sister; both older than me. Being the youngest you might think I was spolied but I feel it had a different affect on me. I was shown different ways of living and was able to find a way I could best be succesful and bring joy to those most dear to me. Speaking of those dear to me… I love animals! I have two cats at home and I love them so much. I love all types of animals; whether it is to cuddle with them, play with them, save them, or just appreciate them from afar in the wild! In my school I am on the executive board for the outdoors club as public relations chair. I also host my own radio show live on air at my school! I love to paint and draw in my free time also on top of playing the ukulele. I like to think I am equally logical as I am creative but the truth is I look at life as a fantasy and I just want to make my life like a beautiful peice of art; Intense and sporadic at times but also free-formed, melodic, gentle, and beautiful. My goal is to live life with acceptance and fearlessness of the shadows and full-appreciation, love, and gratitude for the light."}

However, Ynys Mon will be led by a woman - Llinos Medi, of Plaid Cymru.\n\nSo far, the Vale of Glamorgan is the only authority with an all-male cabinet.\n\nThe Conservatives said they had a lot of first-time councillors in the county without cabinet experience.\n\nMr Thomas, who takes over from a Labour-led administration, said: \"The new cabinet brings a wealth of professional and political experience to the council and will provide the leadership needed to develop services fit for the 21st Century.\"\n\nA female mayor - Janice Charles - has been appointed. The mayor has ceremonial duties and presides over meetings, but does not have executive responsibilities for running the council.\n\n'Serious concerns'\n\nERS Cymru director Jess Blair said: \"The Vale of Glamorgan council's failure to have any women on their cabinet is a new low for diversity.\n\n\"We have serious concerns that other authorities across Wales are also failing to appropriately diversify their cabinets with all councils so far failing to be gender balanced.\"\n\nA spokesman for the Vale's ruling Conservative group said: \"We are proud to have returned on May 4th with a diverse and talented team of first-time councillors, many of whom will go on to be instrumental in shaping the future of the Vale of Glamorgan.\n\n\"In Janice Charles, the Vale of Glamorgan will have an excellent champion as mayor, supported ably by Leighton Rowlands - who we have appointed as the Vale's first ever Youth Champion, and as the youngest deputy mayor in Vale history.\n\n\"We have ambitious and exciting plans for the Vale, and this will be an administration which works tirelessly to increase engagement with young people, to increase diversity and to attract new people into politics.\""}
{"text": "Close\n\nGoogle does not advertise it, but Android 6.0 Marshmallow has a feature that allows users to use their microSD card as internal storage for their phones.\n\nHowever, while this will certainly be helpful for users who have small internal storage capacities on their phone, those with a decent 32 GB should probably turn away from this option.\n\nThe ability to use a microSD card as internal storage was first discovered by Android developer StereoMatch, which shared the newly discovered feature on Reddit last week. When a user inserts a microSD card into the right slot for the first time, the system will ask if they want to use it as a portable storage or internal storage.\n\nUsers who choose portable storage will be able to use their microSD card as expected. They can save photos, videos, music, files and some apps and app data on the card. If they would like to take it out of their phone and connect it to another device, such as their laptop, they will still be able to micro-manage their files.\n\nHowever, choosing internal storage will bake the microSD card straight into the system. Android Marshmallow will reformat and encrypt the card, which means users will first have to back up their saved files before going this route. Once the card is reformatted, all previously saved files are erased and the card becomes the phone's internal storage option and nothing else.\n\nUsers who want to insert their card into a computer will not be able to do so because it has been merged into the phone's internal storage. Under the Storage & USB section, the microSD card will disappear, as it has now become the primary internal storage of the phone. Users will still be able to save apps and app data and view how much storage is left on the built-in storage, but not photos, videos, music and files. That means, if a phone has 8 GB of internal storage and the microSD card is 32 GB, users only have 32 GB of space for their files, not 40 GB.\n\nAlso, built-in eMMC storage is almost always faster than microSD cards, which means users who have at least 32 GB of internal storage may not want to trade in speed for more space, especially if they don't use up all the space on their phones anyway. Still, even with all the caveats, the option to turn an external card into internal storage is definitely beneficial for people who have low storage phones.\n\nPhoto: Takahiro Yamagiwa | Flickr\n\nSee Now: 30 Gadgets And Tech Gifts For Father's Day 2018 That Dad Will Think Are Rad\n\nⓒ 2018 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

{"text": "Washington—Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, today released a report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) that evaluates the suitability and availability of prison facilities inside the United States capable of safely and securely receiving the remaining 166 detainees currently in custody at Guantanamo Bay.\n\n\"This report demonstrates that if the political will exists, we could finally close Guantanamo without imperiling our national security,\" Feinstein said. \"The GAO report makes clear that numerous prisons exist inside the United States—operated by both the Department of Defense and the Department of Justice—capable of holding the 166 detainees who remain at Guantanamo in an environment that meets the security requirements.\"\n\nFeinstein requested the report \"Guantánamo Bay Detainees: Facilities and Factors for Consideration If Detainees Were Brought to the United States\" in 2008.\n\n\"To say that high-risk detainees cannot be held securely in a maximum security prison is just plain wrong,\" Feinstein added. \"The United States already holds 373 individuals convicted of terrorism in 98 facilities across the country. As far as I know, there hasn't been a single security problem reported in any of these cases. This fact outweighs not only the high cost of maintaining Guantanamo—which costs more than $114 million a year—but also provides the same degree of security without the criticism of operating a military prison in an isolated location.\"\n\nKey findings of the GAO report:\n\nAlthough GAO specifically states its review \"did not include an evaluation of whether specific U.S. facilities would be suitable for holding Guantanamo Bay detainees\" (p. 2), the report makes clear that there are prisons in the United States that can hold the 166 Guantanamo detainees safely and securely under the security conditions that exist at Guantanamo.\n\nThe Department of Defense and the Department of Justice both operate detention facilities comparable to Guantanamo Bay and currently hold convicted terrorists and other felons connected to terrorism.\n\nThe report notes that existing facilities would need to be modified and current inmates may need to be relocated.\n\nIf Congress agrees to allow Guantanamo detainees to be transferred to prisons in the United States, the Department of Defense in particular has facilities available to hold them once adjustments are made and security is taken into account.\n\nThere are six Defense Department facilities where Guantanamo Bay detainees could be held in the United States that are currently at a combined 48 percent capacity:\n\nAs of August 2012, Bureau of Prisons and the Marshals Service had custody of at least 377 inmates charged with or convicted of crimes related to terrorism (or a connection to terrorism), according to the GAO.

{"text": "Mayor Rahm Emanuel's administration is moving to the second phase of its effort to lure providers of super-fast, 1-gig Internet to Chicago, and it's offering potentially a very big carrot to get them: the use of everything from the roof of City Hall to light poles and sewer tunnels.\n\nIn an action that's been expected for a while but is still significant, the city tomorrow is posting a solicitation for interested parties to list their bona fides, known as a request for qualifications. Once interested parties are cut down to a short list, the city will issue a request for bids.\n\nThe RFQ will be on the city's website at CityofChicago.org/bids.\n\nThe city began the process more than a year ago by asking interested parties to give their ideas about how to design a bid, and a healthy two dozen groups reportedly responded. But its goal remains the same: to attract super-fast Internet to certain neighborhoods in an effort to give Chicago a leg up in an increasingly competitive world.\n\nThe city says it wants bidders, at least initially, in seven neighborhoods: the Loop, West Loop and River North in the central area, plus the University of Chicago's Hyde Park campus, Ravenswood on the North Side, the Pullman Industrial Corridor on the Far South Side and the Illinois Institute of Technology/Bronzeville area on the mid-South Side.\n\nTo get companies to spend what could be substantial investment capital in those areas, the city is offering the use of potentially lots of city assets. Included: city-owned fiber cable, rooftops of city buildings, sewers, freight tunnels and light poles. In addition, the RFQ says the city is prepared to coordinate excavation of city streets for sewer work with broadband providers and notes that it could itself be a customer for such service.\n\nSuper-fast Internet now is available in some portions of the city but tends to be very expensive. The city says its goal is to cut costs 90 percent, to no more than $500 a month for a good connection. Such service is 10 times faster than the best residential speeds cable providers offer and 50 to 100 times faster than what most consumers have. It appeals mainly to business and academic and research users.\n\n\"The wireless and fiber-optic connections of broadband infrastructure represent the railroads and rivers of the 21st century,\" Mr. Emanuel said in a statement. \"Just as Chicago remains the center of the nation's transportation infrastructure, this initiative will keep the city at the center of this century's critical information infrastructure.\"\n\nCity officials were not available for comment today to say when the RFP might go out, or provide background on just how interested the private sector may be in joining in."}

{"text": "Movie\n\nAlthough calling Ledger's performance as The Joker 'brilliant,' Hardy doesn't want to be compared to the late actor as claiming, 'I'm not trying to be better than somebody else.'\n\nMay 28, 2012\n\nAceShowbiz - Tom Hardy recently discussed his role as Bane in \"The Dark Knight Rises\" which often gets compared to Heath Ledger's critically acclaimed performance as The Joker in 2008's \"The Dark Knight\". Praising Ledger as \"brilliant,\" Hardy admitted that he never sees the late Australian actor as a competitor when it comes to who's the best in portraying Batman's archenemy.\n\n\"No, I don't think absolutely,\" he told Collider when asked if he has any apprehension for being the guy that would follow Ledger's Joker. \"That would be putting myself in a competition with somebody who's clearly brilliant. And it's not a question of whose talent is greater or whose work is greater.\"\n\nThe British actor continued, \"It's just trying to be the best that we can be, rather then trying to be better than somebody else. I'm not trying to be better than somebody else.\" He insisted, \"What he did was amazing. That's that. I've got a part I've got to play, and I want to play my part.\"\n\nThe Heath Ledger comparison aside, Hardy recalled the moment when he was first cast as Bane. The 34-year-old actor admitted that he wasn't really familiar with the character at that time. \"I had no immediate knowledge of the world of Batman at all. I'm quite incubated,\" he opened up.\n\nHardy confessed that he first started to learn about Bane after he won the coveted role. \"I just keep myself and my dog. He's not with me anymore. And if something comes in, it's always a neat experience. So I started when I first got the part,\" he said.\n\nOn having to wear Bane's costume, Hardy shared, \"Hot. It's very, very, very hot. Yeah. We're all getting very hot.\" He said, \"You think about the lads that are out in Afghanistan and Baghdad, and you think about the kit they have to wear, well then it's actually not that bad, is it? But it is hot. It's hard to breathe.\"\n\nSlated for a July 20 release in the United States, \"The Dark Knight Rises\" will see Bane arriving in Gotham City and forcing Batman to resurface after taking the fall for Harvey Dent's crimes. Directed by Christopher Nolan, the highly anticipated film also stars Christian Bale as Batman, Anne Hathaway as Catwoman and Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon."}
{"text": "Just like nearly everyone else, President Obama thinks Kentucky will become the first team to go undefeated and win the national title since Indiana in 1976.\n\nObama released his bracket Wednesday on ESPN, just as he's done in past years. He has the Wildcats beating another set of Wildcats — Villanova — in the title game.\n\nAs far as upsets go, Obama is clearly on the No. 12 train as he has Buffalo upsetting fifth-seeded West Virginia in the Midwest Region and No. 12 Wyoming over No. 5 Northern Iowa in the East Region. And perhaps spurred by Ole Miss's comeback victory over BYU in the play-in game Tuesday night, the president also has the 11th-seeded Rebels beating Xavier. But after the second round, Obama's bracket gets very chalky. He has 10th-seeded Davidson reaching the Sweet 16 out of the South Region, but in the other three regions he goes straight chalk, with the top four seeded teams reaching the region semifinals.\n\n[Who will be this year's No. 12 Cinderella?]\n\nObama has been just okay with his NCAA tournament brackets in the past, just like the rest of us:\n\nLast year, President Obama finished in 72.9 percentile overall, but missed on national champion Connecticut (he had Michigan State beating Louisville in title game). His best finish since becoming president was in 2011, when he was in the 87.4 percentile despite picking Kansas to win the national title (Connecticut did that year as well). Obama did pick the correct national champion in 2009 — North Carolina.\n\nAll the President's picks: Check out his NCAA Tournament Bracket → http://t.co/ENqqesV08s #Baracketology pic.twitter.com/gYREANLa6P — The White House (@WhiteHouse) March 18, 2015\n\nObama also told ESPN's Andy Katz that he would like to see college basketball adopt the 30-second shot clock:\n\n\"I am an advocate, by the way, for the NCAA changing the rules in terms of shortening the shot clock, widening the lane, moving the three-point line back a little bit,\" Obama said. \"The fact of the matter is I like how basketball is going in the NBA because it's fluid. What (Spurs coach) Gregg Popovich did with San Antonio I think is being replicated now with Atlanta and Golden State, and you're seeing a lot of teams move in that direction. I'd like to see college basketball get back to that. It's a fast game, let's get it down to 30 seconds at minimum.\"\n\nIn an attempt to increase scoring, the NCAA will experiment with the 30-second shot clock during National Invitation Tournament games this season."}

This is what we dream for. Bluebird skies, cool weather,\" says Hammond.\n\nHammond is one of only a handful of professional skywriters in existence.

So far, the bill is between $20,000 and $25,000. The last flight is scheduled for Sunday. Hammond says he'll also be decorating the sky over Baton Rouge sometime soon.\n\nCharla Miller works with the man behind the messages and she says her boss has even bigger plans.\n\n\"He has a big concern for the violence that has been going on locally and nationally, and this has both a local scope and hopefully a future national scope for him too with the skywriting,\" says Miller.\n\nThrough his non-profit, Noigiler (\"religion\" spelled backwards), he hopes to raise enough money to purchase the plane, Sky Magic, so that he can continue to share the love from above in cities across the country.

Police said it has taken control of the protests which also spread to a number of towns in western and central part of the region.\n\nProtesters alleged that the security forces have responded with excessive force although the students were on peaceful protest.\n\nAn official of the main Oromo opposition party, the Oromo Federalist Congress, who preferred anonymity, called on the Ethiopian government to urgently probe the incident.\n\nThe official urged for suspected members of the security force behind the killings to be brought in to justice.\n\nThe opposition officials further called for an immediate release of all protesters who are being held in custody.\n\nLast year similar protests that took place in the Oromia region over the unpopular master plan led to deaths of dozens of university students and other protesters.\n\nThe Oromos are the single largest ethnic group in Ethiopia which make up over 40% of Ethiopia's 95 million population. The Oromos have long felt being discriminated and marginalized by successive governments.\n\nMeanwhile, the Oromo Federalist Congress (OFC) party warned that Ethiopia is at a state of risk of disintegration due to the violent polices of the central government.\n\n(ST)"}
{"text": "The sport's incredible popularity has turned players into national celebrities and has made their mental and physical deterioration front-page news. In 2012, the former All-Pro linebacker Junior Seau killed himself. The autopsy confirmed that he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., the cause of the dementia that is increasingly prevalent among former players. A whole new crop of retired stars, including Tony Dorsett and Brett Favre, are just beginning to report symptoms like memory loss and depression.\n\nThere are two basic rationalizations for fans like myself. The first is that the N.F.L. is working hard to make the game safer, which is flimsy at best. The league spent years denying that the game was causing neurological damage. Now that the medical evidence is incontrovertible, it has sought to reduce high-speed collisions, fining defenders for helmet-to-helmet hits and other flagrantly violent play. Its most significant response has been to offer $765 million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by more than 4,500 former players, but a judge recently blocked the settlement. It simply wasn't enough money.\n\nThe second argument is that players choose to incur the game's risks and are lavishly compensated for doing so. This is technically true. N.F.L. players are members of an elite fraternity that knowingly places self-sacrifice, valor and machismo above ethical or medical common sense. But most start out as kids with limited options. They may love football for its inherent virtues. But they also quickly come to see the game as a path to glory and riches. These rewards aren't inherent. They arise from a culture of fandom that views players as valuable only so long as they can perform.\n\nBut if I'm completely honest about my misgivings, it's not just that the N.F.L. is a negligent employer. It's how our worship of the game has blinded us to its pathologies.\n\nImage\n\nPro sports are, by definition, monetized arenas for hypermasculinity. Football is nowhere near as overtly vicious as, say, boxing. But it is the one sport that most faithfully recreates our childhood fantasies of war as a winnable contest.\n\nOver the past 12 years, as Americans have sought a distraction from the moral incoherence of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the game has served as a loyal and satisfying proxy. It has become an acceptable way of experiencing our savage impulses, the cultural lodestar when it comes to consuming violence. What differentiates it from the glut of bloody films and video games we devour is our awareness that the violence in football, and the toll of that violence, is real."}
{"text": "As part of our 'Real Customers, Real Service' series we've been investigating what makes an exceptional customer experience. What should companies do to keep their customers coming back for more?\n\nThe poet Maya Angelou wrote: 'while people may forget what you said and did, they always remember how you made them feel'. That's very true when it comes to customer service.\n\nOutstanding service can leave you feeling positive, valued and likely to want to repeat the experience. Terrible customer service can leave you feeling stressed, frustrated, angry and, in many cases, never wanting that experience again.\n\nTop big brands rated for customer service\n\nWhen we asked thousands of Brits about the brands they rated most highly for customer service, Lush, Lakeland, First Direct and John Lewis topped our league table. Cosmetics firm Lush is the clear winner in our 2013 survey of 100 big-name brands, being the only brand to achieve an 'excellent' five-star rating for having knowledge and helpful staff, and for making customers feel valued.\n\nRyanair, TalkTalk and Npower need to pull up their socks, however: these brands limp into the bottom places of our survey. If you're a Which? member, you'll find the full results of our 2013 customer service survey in the October 2013 issue of Which? magazine, which can also be found online.\n\nTop five points for good customer service\n\nWith those winners and losers ringing in your ears, here's our advice for companies who want to inspire loyalty in their customers:\n\n1. Exceptional customer service more than pays for itself. Happy customers are loyal customers; loyal customers are profitable customers.\n\n2. Value your customers and they'll value you. Treat each person as an individual. Understand what your customers want and don't waste their time by keeping them waiting and not being able to sort things out first time.\n\n3. Invest in your staff. Your customers are likely to judge your brand by its staff, so investing in recruitment and training will pay dividends in the long term.\n\n4. A complaint is a gift. Senior managers need to listen to feedback from staff and customers and act on it. If things have gone wrong, see that as an opportunity for improvement. Seize the chance to recover the situation, and retain rather than lose customers.\n\n5. Don't rest on your laurels. Respond to changing customer demand. None of the companies that excel in our survey have done so by failing to innovate or improve. Complacency hasn't got them there, nor will it keep them there.\n\nWhat do you think of our advice for companies? And what do you think makes companies stand out for good (or bad!) customer service?"}

I'm a sucker for cute details and this game has tons of them! I think they put a lot of efford into making the world so beautiful and the characters so likeable.\n\nThe story somehow reminds me of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles. You're defending your oasis from the evil (the chaos). In order to do that, you have to make your oasis grow by getting travellers to stay in your oasis and built their shop. You're the one providing their stock, btw :D The bigger your oasis, the stronger you get and you get to explore more places, as you recruit more seedlings with different skills (digging, mining etc). The dungeons are fun and clever, without being frustrating. I enjoyed solving the puzzles and fighting the monsters.\n\nI'm only at 12 residents right now but about 20hrs in because there is so much to do and I love that you can decide what you want to do: exploring, collecting materials, doing requests, crafting and so on. Only thing is, I whished they gave us more oppurtunities to customize our oasis or character and made the other characters a littler deeper- sometimes it feels too shallow and I can't even tell who is who bc no one really stands out- but this is of course only my opinion.\n\nIf you liked the games I mentioned in the beginning of my review, you'll love this game!

{"text": "We can thank Magenta, Italy, a quiet town outside Milan, for the name of the color that isn't really any color at all, but a trick of the eyes. And, actually, it's probably the French not the Italians we should be thanking. To be honest, it's all a little confusing, but we'll try to sort it out!\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the event that catapulted Magenta into infamy: The Battle of Magenta, fought on the outskirts of the town during the Second Italian War of Independence. Some historians say the Battle of Magenta was a turning point in the war. That's all well and good, of course – but how did the color magenta get its name from this battle, what do the French have to do with it, and what was that about it not being a color at all?\n\nAs it turns out, the town of Magenta, and the eponymous battle was fought the same year that a synthetic aniline dye called fuchsine was invented. In fact, it was the first synthetic dye ever made – prior to this, all dyes had come from natural sources such as plants, animals and minerals. But as handmade rugs from the East gained popularity, the need for cheaper dyes that could be produced easily became a priority.\n\nShortly after this dye was invented, the color was renamed magenta. Now, here's where the French come in. The color reminded someone – most likely the person who named it – of the uniforms worn by the Zouave troops of the French army that fought in the Battle of Magenta. There were no photographs at that time, naturally, but paintings of the Zouave troops as well as depictions of the battle featured their brightly colored, baggy pants.\n\nSo if magenta was named after the color of some French pants in an Italian town, why is there any debate as to whether or not it exists? After all, these aren't the emperor's new clothes – we can all agree that the French weren't fighting pantsless!\n\nDon't worry. Magenta really is a color – at least on paper, and in cans of paint, and on your computer screen. Where it does not actually exist, though, is in the light spectrum visible to humans and gives a name to what our eyes are telling us we're seeing.\n\nIn the spectrum there is violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red – but there definitely is no pink, known among scientists as the slang word for magenta. When we see magenta, we're actually seeing both ends of the light spectrum – violet and red – and our brain is inventing magenta all on its own!\n\nsource"}

They were called \"Crime Review\" and \"Crime Capsule.\" But O'Toole saw that crime and operations data was seldom utilized, so she requested that the crime data center compile monthly reports on property crimes by precinct. This yielded clear results, showing that the \"numbers told a different story than the anecdotal remarks.\"\n\nCopyright 2017 KING"}
{"text": "Scientists Show How Gene Implicated in Parkinson 's Disease Repairs and Replaces Nerve Cells\n\nThe Trinity research group, led by Smurfit Professor of Medical Genetics, Professor Seamus Martin, has just published its findings in the internationally renowned, peer-reviewed Cell Press journal, Cell Reports.\n\nAlthough mutation of Parkin has been known to lead to an early onset form of Parkinson's for many years, understanding what it actually did within cells has been difficult to solve. Now, Professor Martin and colleagues have discovered that in response to specific types of cell damage, Parkin can trigger the self-destruction of 'injured' nerve cells by switching on a controlled process of 'cellular suicide' called apoptosis.\n\nUsing cutting-edge research techniques, the Martin laboratory, funded by Science Foundation Ireland, found that damage to mitochondria (which function as 'cellular battery packs') activates the Parkin protein, which results in one of two different outcomes – either self-destruction or a repair mode. Which outcome was chosen depended on the degree of damage suffered by the cellular battery packs.\n\nImportantly, these new findings suggest that one of the problems in Parkinson's disease may be the failure to clear away sick nerve cells with faulty cellular battery packs, to make way for healthy replacements. Instead, sickly and dysfunctional nerve cells may accumulate, which effectively prevents the recruitment of fresh replacements.\n\nParkin-expressing cells (red) undergoing programmed cell death.\n\nCommenting on the findings, Professor Martin stated: \"This discovery is surprising and turns on its head the way we thought that Parkin functions. Until now, we have thought of Parkin as a brake on cell death within nerve cells, helping to delay their death. However, our new data suggests the contrary: Parkin may in fact help to weed out injured and sick nerve cells, which probably facilitates their replacement. This suggests that Parkinson's disease could result from the accumulation of defective neurons due to the failure of this cellular weeding process.\"\n\nProfessor Martin also added: \"We are very grateful for the support of Science Foundation Ireland, who funded this research. This work represents an excellent example of how basic research leads to fundamental breakthroughs in our understanding of how diseases arise. Without such knowledge, it would be very difficult to develop new therapies.\"\n\nThe work was carried out in Trinity's School of Genetics and Microbiology. The research team was led by Professor Martin and included Trinity PhD student Richard Carroll and Research Fellow Dr Emilie Hollville. The Trinity research team is internationally recognised for its work on the regulation of cell death.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nThomas Deane, Press Officer for the Faculty of Engineering, Mathematics and Science | deaneth@tcd.ie | 01 896 4685"}
{"text": "Mere hours after Chicago rang in 2016 with fireworks along its famous riverwalk, the city reported its first homicide.\n\nInterested in ? Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nA 24-year-old man was shot in the chest a few minutes after 2 a.m. in Chicago's Bronzeville neighborhood, according to police. He was pronounced dead at the scene and the shooter is at large, a police spokeswoman said. The investigation is ongoing.\n\nAnother man, 38, was hurt in the brawl, according to police. He transported himself to a nearby hospital and is listed in good condition after being shot in his hand, officials said.\n\nThis is the first homicide of 2016 in a city that saw a sharp increase in murders last year.\n\nWhile overall crime went down in the city last year, murders and shooting incidents were on the rise in 2015, police reports show. There were 468 reported murders in the city in 2015, a 13 percent increase from 2014, according to police. There were 2,427 shooting incidents last year, a 16 percent spike from 2014.\n\nThe city was rocked by protests last year after dash-cam video showing the shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald was released. McDonald's shooting strained relations between the community and the Chicago Police Department and protesters called for the resignation of some of the city's top officials, including Mayor Rahm Emanuel.\n\nThe dash-cam video, which the city fought to keep under wraps for more than a year, was released on Nov. 24, ahead of a court-mandated deadline. The footage shows the 2014 shooting of McDonald at the hands of veteran police officer Jason Van Dyke, who has pleaded not guilty to six counts of first-degree murder in connection to the case. McDonald was shot 16 times.\n\nOn Dec. 31, the city released thousands of emails related to the McDonald case after a weeks-long request from media organizations. The emails appear to show a carefully coordinated response to the teen's shooting between the mayor's office, police and the agency that reviews police-involved shootings -- all of which have been harshly criticized for the way the case was handled.\n\nPolitical fallout from the case includes the firing of Chicago's top cop Garry McCarthy; a recently announced overhaul of the reviewing agency and police training; a federal investigation into the practices of the police department; and consistent calls for the resignation of Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez, who also handled the McDonald case.\n\nEmanuel cut his Cuban vacation short this week and returned to Chicago to respond to another police shooting, this time involving an allegedly mentally unstable man and a neighbor. Two people died in that shooting."}

{"text": "A Columbian computer expert has claimed he have single-handedly changed the results of major elections across Latin America for a decade, as part of an explosive new interview which throws open the region's \"dark side of politics\".\n\nAndrés Sepúlveda told Bloomberg that he accepted huge amounts of money to hack and disrupt elections in favour of right-wing candidates in Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Panama for almost eight years. His confessions are so startling the Mexican government was forced into an immediate denial that president Enrique Peña Nieto's 2012 election campaign spied on its rivals.\n\nCurrently serving a 10-year jail sentence in his native Columbia for computer crime relating to the country's elections in 2014, the 31-year-old said: \"My job was to do actions of dirty war and psychological operations, black propaganda, rumours – the whole dark side of politics that nobody knows exists but everyone can see.\"\n\nHis services, which started small in 2005 as petty acts of digital vandalism, did not come cheap. By the end he was running sophisticated operations in charge of dozens of other hackers stealing data and surveilling' leftist political rivals. His activities included installing bespoke malware onto rivals' computers in order to monitor phone and email communications, as well as stealing drafts of speeches, campaign schedules and confidential minutes of internal meetings. He also operated a \"virtual army\" of Twitter bots and sock puppets, which he would use to undermine opponents and create the illusion of popular support for his clients.\n\nIn the 2012 elections in Mexico, which returned Peña Nieto's right-wing government to power after a decade in the wilderness, he claims to have been given a $600,000 (£420,000) budget to sabotage Peña Nieto's two main oppositions.\n\nChillingly, he could even tailor his work to hamstring individuals. He claims to have set up fake Facebook accounts for gay men who would then publicly support a conservative Catholic candidate, while he used automated 3am campaign calls in a tight race in the race for the governorship of the Mexican state of Jalisco that falsely purported to come from Enrique Alfaro Ramírez, a left-wing candidate who went on to lose by a hair.\n\nSepúlveda claims that money was a secondary motive, and that his goal was explicitly political. Growing up hating Marxist Columbian militias, he wanted to bolster rightist candidates against what he describes as \"dictatorships and socialist governments\".\n\nMany of the people named as clients in the article have issued outright denials. For his part Sepúlveda says he wanted to go public as he was living under the threat of death, and in the hope that he would win a lighter sentence on review."}

It revoked trade preferences with Gambia last year following reports of a crackdown against the country's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community.\n\n\"We are reviewing what additional actions are appropriate to respond to this worsening situation,\" Rice said.\n\n\"We repeat our call for the Gambian government, and all governments, to lead inclusively, repudiate intolerance, and promote respect for the universal rights and fundamental freedoms of all people.\"\n\nRice's comments come ahead of the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia on Sunday.\n\nJammeh has ruled the former British colony, which has a population of 1.8 million, with an iron fist since seizing power in 1994.\n\nHis presidential guard squashed a coup attempt in December, and rights groups have reported a wave of arrests, detentions and harassment targeting family members of those suspected of involvement.\n\nHomosexuality is illegal in 36 out of 54 African countries and punishable by death in four, according to rights watchdog Amnesty International."}
{"text": "Hamilton Mountain. That 100-metre high wall of limestone and shale that is a huge part of the topography of our city.\n\nThere are those who laugh that we call it \"the mountain\"… and rightly so. Visit the Canadian Rockies, or the Coast Mountains of BC, or the Laurentians in Québec, and there you will see what a mountain is. Even by Ontario standards, ours isn't (see this, and this, and this; note that this is really just the same thing as ours, just much higher, with ski runs).\n\nHamilton Mountain, from Wentworth Street. Is this a mountain?\n\nWhat about when viewed from the south end of Kenilworth Avenue?\n\nThe Dundas Peak. Surely this must be a mountain?\n\nSeriously though, what else would people from elsewhere have called it had they lived here? The Bump? The Cliff? The Big Step? The Ledge? Or how about The Top Shelf?\n\nNo matter that the misnomer is a bit of Hamiltonia to which most locals don't even give second thoughts in conversation, our mountain has really defined the city in so many ways.\n\nGeologically, it's a section of the Niagara Escarpment — one of southern Ontario's major natural features. You can read more about it on the websites of the Niagara Escarpment Commission or the Bruce Trail Conservancy, or on Wikipedia.\n\nGeographically, it has shaped Hamilton's urban growth, its slopes making it easier for the city to stretch west-to-east before it grew north-to-south. And even after the city began to develop above the escarpment, it remained a line dividing old from new, and marking a boundary for demographics and politics. It gave us electrical power. It presented a major transportation challenge — while it was conquered by long-gone incline railways and a number of mountain access roads, occasionally Mother Nature has shown us who really is the boss (the Claremont and the Sherman Access being the most recent examples) and she will surely do so again. It also affects patterns of air flow, and sometimes the weather differs between above and below.\n\nThe mountain has been Giver of Waterfalls and Mother of Trails. It is scaled by stairways. It used to provide a couple of inner-city ski hills. Visually, it is a rocky and leafy backdrop for the skyline of the lower city, and from the top it's just a great view of the city and beyond.\n\nIt's hard to imagine Hamilton without The Mountain. It would certainly be a different looking city, with a different street pattern and a different layout. But there's probably so much we would miss. A few laughs from outsiders is a small trade to make."}

And since a typical St. Paddy's Day celebration couldn't get farther from anything actually Irish, being furthest away from that day is a good time to explore some authentic Irish beer!\n\nIreland's craft scene has been steadily growing over the past 5 years and shows no signs of stopping. Last week, I had the opportunity to travel my way through Ireland, trying as many craft beers as I could find. Luckily, almost every pub in Ireland has a handle or two of the local brewery's offering, and most towns have at least one craft centric pub. Their craft beer association, Beoir, has been advocating on behalf of the craft industry and has clearly been making a huge impact around the country.\n\nThey're pumping out some great beers over there, so now would be a good time to make an Irish beer forum friend for trading. Here are six to try:\n\nGalway Bay – Of Foam and Fury\n\nDouble IPA\n\n8.5% ABV | 132 IBU\n\nGrapefruity and tropical notes with a pleasant malt profile and dry finish. Definitely could give any American DIPA a run for its money.\n\nKinnegar Brewery – Rustbucket\n\nRye Ale\n\n5.1% ABV | 20 IBU\n\nGreat spice notes and malty goodness. Perfectly balanced, as well, to make it drinkable all evening.\n\nEight Degrees – The Full Irish\n\nSingle Malt IPA\n\n6% ABV | 65 IBU\n\nWon Beoir's 2015 Beer of the Year and is surely deserved. Great tropical hop notes and well balanced bready malt presence.\n\nMetalman Brewing – Metalman Pale Ale\n\nPale Ale\n\n4.3% ABV | 0 IBU\n\nGreat session pale ale with notes of pine and peach.\n\nTrouble Brewing – Dark Arts Porter\n\nPorter\n\n4.4% ABV | 0 IBU\n\nWonderful roasty notes with caramel and toffee the prominent flavors. Perfectly used hops create a bitter finish and balance if out from being too sweet.\n\nO'Hara's Brewery – Leann Folláin\n\nExtra Irish Stout\n\n6% ABV | 0 IBU\n\nThis was my favorite beer I tried during my travels. Reminiscent of an Imperial Stout, but much drier. Dark chocolate, coffee, vanilla with the dry finish that leaves you wanting another.\n\nHonorable mentions:\n\nBlack IPA by Blacks of Kinsale\n\nThe Hurler by Four Provinces\n\nComeragh Challenger by Dungarvan Brewing"}

{"text": "The first two teaser trailers for the upcoming Star Wars: Episode VII — The Force Awakens have proved one thing conclusively: music matters when it comes to blockbusters.\n\nIn The Dissolve's excellent list of the top 50 blockbusters of all time, the film site's editorial director, Keith Phipps, in a longer blurb on Star Wars points out how so much of what made the film great stemmed from director George Lucas surrounding himself with excellent collaborators.\n\nTo bring the film to life, Lucas selected favorite elements from a lifetime of omnivorous reading and movie-watching-from Joseph Campbell to Akira Kurosawa to World War II dramas-then filtered those elements into a space opera that paid homage to the thrill-a-minute movie serials of the 1930s and '40s. Along the way, he chose brilliant collaborators like conceptual artist Ralph McQuarrie, sound designer Ben Burtt, and composer John Williams, without whom Star Wars might have become a drastically different movie. (The Williams-free first trailer, for instance, suggests a far eerier experience.)\n\nPhipps is dead-on about that first trailer. Watch above to see how strange the film seems without the famous blast of Williams's triumphant score.\n\nWilliams is one of only four or five musicians who could lay claim to being the greatest film composer of all time, and even if he doesn't come out on top in your own personal estimation, he's responsible for some of the most instantly iconic bits of film music ever. The theme from Jurassic Park. The flying theme from E.T. The theme from Superman. He's even responsible for the ominous theme from Jaws, which is now convenient shorthand for cinematic terror. How many other composers can create such a primal, gut-churning emotion with just two notes?\n\nAnd without him, Star Wars seems more like Alien than it does the movie we know and love. It's weird and ominous and filled with strange creatures. The camera slowly zooms in on the title of the film. The soundscape is empty, haunted. And the announcer's tone suggests we're about to settle in for a very spooky tale of outer-space strangeness. It's not a very enticing pitch for one of the most successful films ever made.\n\nIt's interesting to contemplate Star Wars without Williams, because it reminds us of how all films are one bad choice away from being unwatchable. How many great movies would have been terrible with a different actor, or a different editor, or even a different hair and makeup team? And how many bad movies were just one dumb choice away from being masterpieces?\n\nAh, you've waited long enough after watching that trailer. Here's the fanfare you know and love."}
{"text": "University of Alberta doctoral candidate Scott Persons measured the limb length for 53 different species of carnivorous dinosaurs to create an equation to score how much each was built for speed. (Scott Persons)\n\nA new study published out of the University of Alberta has found that carnivorous dinosaurs evolved to become faster and faster over time — and the proof is in the leg length.\n\nAs part of his doctoral research, lead author Scott Persons travelled the world measuring the limb lengths for 53 different species of carnivorous bipedal dinosaurs, including the Velociraptor, Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus rex.\n\nIn particular, Persons looked at the length of the dinosaurs' legs below the knee. As a rule, he said, the longer the lower leg is in comparison to the upper leg, the faster the animal is.\n\nModern-day cheetahs have proportionately longer legs than hyenas. That relationship is mirrored in the animals' speeds, Persons said.\n\n\"That's true for modern carnivores, and must have been true for dinosaurs,\" Persons said in a statement released Wednesday.\n\nLooking at each fossil carnivore's \"cursorial limb proportion score\" — in other words, a measure of how much each was built for speed — Persons determined that they evolved to be faster and faster over time.\n\nBy measuring the lower limb length from 53 different fossilized dinosaur species, which ranged from chicken-sized to the length of a school bus, Persons hypothesizes bipedal carnivores evolved to become faster and faster over time. (Scott Persons)\n\nAnd leading the pack: the Nanotyrannus, a five-metre tall dinosaur similar in appearance to a young Tyrannosaurus. In fact, the resemblance between the two is so close that it wasn't until leg lengths were compared that it was conclusively determined they were not, in fact, the same species.\n\n\"In terms of Cretaceous ecology, T. rex was the lion and Nanotyrannus was the cheetah,\" Persons said of his findings.\n\n\"As far as I'm concerned, it was the scariest dinosaur. Sure, it might take it four to five bites to eat you, while T. rex could do it in just one or two. But eaten is eaten—and no dinosaur was better adapted to chase you down.\"\n\nThat burst in speed comes at a cost, however, as longer legs are less-suited to carrying heavy weights and are weaker.\n\n\"Speed determines what prey you can catch, how you hunt it, and the sort of environment that you are most successful in,\" Persons said.\n\n\"Over evolution, you have these two conflicting forces: the need for speed and the need for weight support.\""}

The changes will dilute and defeat the whole purpose of the law, said Yadav, once a close aide of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal till he transformed into a full-time politician.\n\nVarious non-profit organisations and think-tanks are learnt to have made recommendations and suggestions to the government opposing the dilution of the act.\n\nThe Bill has a new section that bars investigating agencies from initiating an inquiry or investigation against a public servant without the prior approval of the competent authority, which means the political bosses, Yadav said, terming this the babu-neta nexus to protect the corrupt.\n\nThe existing law requires approval from a higher authority before prosecuting any public servant to protect honest officers from harassment, persecution and frivolous litigation.\n\nThe new Bill requires a court order to sanction prosecution against a corrupt public servant, which, Yadav said, would discourage victims of corruption and activists from prosecuting such individuals.\n\nPriyanka Rao, a senior researcher with PRS Legislative Research, a not-for-profit outfit, termed the sanction before prosecution as \"standard\" but expressed concern over the proposed approval before inquiry or investigation.\n\n\"Is not the process of investigation (meant to establish) a prima facie case against someone? However, if at the start of an investigation, you need approval, on what basis will you get this approval? It is a big challenge. How will we strike a balance between allowing honest officers to work smoothly and (ensuring) investigation and trial do not take a long time,\" she questioned.\n\nThe amendment has done away with the protection cover to the bribe-giver against prosecution and makes both the bribe-giver and the bribe-taker equally punishable, which would deter the former -- the victim -- from speaking out in cases against public servants, Yadav contended.\n\nFirst Published: Dec 15, 2016 12:32 IST"}

{"text": "When EA first revealed that FIFA would be coming to Nintendo Switch, the first question many fans asked was: which version of FIFA? The company later confirmed it would indeed be FIFA 18--not, as some imagined after PS Vita's watered down FIFA Football, FIFA For Switch.\n\nHowever, after a brief play session at E3 2017, it appears the football game coming to Nintendo's hybrid console is not quite the fully-fledged title I was hoping for. We already discovered that the Switch version won't run on the same engine and doesn't include The Journey, FIFA's story mode, but the problems run deeper than those. Upon playing FIFA 18 on Switch for the first time, it becomes apparent that this is definitely not FIFA 18. This is not the same game I played a month ago on PS4.\n\nFrom the character models to the feel of the dribbling, almost everything feels quite far removed from FIFA 18 on PS4 and Xbox One. It's probably closest to FIFA 15 or 16's gameplay in its on-pitch action--a little quicker both to respond and to move--and given I wasn't a huge fan of FIFA 18 at preview stage, that's probably a good thing.\n\nOther than that, it feels fairly feature-rich and as competent a FIFA port as you could realistically expect on Switch. Until you detach the Joy-Cons to play in multiplayer, that is.\n\nFor many FIFA players, the primary--if not only--reason to buy FIFA on Switch ahead of the full PS4, Xbox One, or PC versions would be to have the ability to play on the move with friends. But playing with just one Joy-Con each makes it far too difficult to enjoyably do so. Fewer buttons than a standard controller (you lose out on two triggers, a d-pad, and a stick) means less flexibility on the pitch. On the standard control scheme, no adaptations are made to the original controls, so instead of, say, assigning a heavy touch to a double flick of the left stick in lieu of the the absent right, there simply appears to be no way of performing a heavy touch. This also applies to skill moves, accurate changes of player while defending, changing tactics on-the-fly, finesse shots, driven passes, and all types of chipped kicks.\n\nTaking away functionality depending on your controller setup is incredibly frustrating, so here's hoping EA can implement an elegant solution in time for launch on September 29, 2017.\n\nWhile FIFA 18 feels a little dated, then, it is still a lot of fun. However, if you plan to play on-the-go-multiplayer--the port's primary advantage over the PS4 and Xbox One editions--it might be best not to switch flanks from console."}

It recommends six alternatives for further study.\n\nAfter the public comments are gathered, state and federal transportation officials could decide to reinstate some of the discarded options or consider new ideas in its Final Scoping Report. Any ideas that don't make the cut will not be studied further. Ideas that do make the cut will be fleshed out in greater detail.

{"text": "The man who put the Frank in Dodd-Frank is NOT feeling \"The Bern.\"\n\nFormer Massachusetts congressman Barney Frank penned an op-ed for the Washington Post in which he openly questions what he sees as Bernie Sanders' overly simplistic approach to attacking Wall Street.\n\nAt the crux of Frank's critique is the notion that Bernie and his bros are quite fond of saying \"Banks are too big! Break them Up!\" none of them can seem to tell you how big is too big or what \"breaking them up\" actually entails.\n\nHere's Barney…\n\nThere is a fundamental weakness in the position of those who insist that the only way to deal with financial institutions that are \"too big to fail\" is to break them up: their acknowledgment that the central question of how big is \"too big\" is too hard to answer. This is rarely made explicit, but it is universal.\n\nAnd Barney named names…\n\nAcross the ideological range from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to Neel Kashkari, president of the Minneapolis branch of the Federal Reserve, the \"break 'em up\" advocates scrupulously avoid suggesting any size beyond which banks must not be allowed to exist.\n\nAside from reminding readers that Bernie isn't even technically a Democrat, Barney manages to get in a tight shot on registered Republican/bailout czar Kashkari.\n\nBut Barney saves the real lumber for the second paragraph.\n\nThe reason for this glaring omission — which renders their argument of little practical use for makers of actual decisions — is clear, once the focus is on the meaning of \"too big to fail,\" as opposed to its invocation as a general expression of distrust of banks. The issue is how to avoid a situation in which an institution has incurred so much debt that its inability to pay threatens the stability of the financial system. In other words, how do we prevent a repetition of the damage caused by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008? Therein lies their dilemma.\n\nEssentially, even Barney Frank is now saying that he would like to hear a more little nuance from the Bernie campaign than \"Banks bad!\" And that makes him – Barney f@cking Frank! – a compromised centrist in the eyes of many Bernie Bros who seem just fine wallowing in the public pool of generalized, detail-free bank hatred.\n\nFrank spends the rest of his column explaining and defending the untapped power of Dodd-Frank, so take that as you will, but this Barney/Bernie salvo casts an even brighter light on the Democratic party schism Hillary will have to furiously patch over once Bernie steps aside in the coming weeks or days.\n\nBarney Frank: Sanders's 'too big to fail' mantra ignores a huge problem [WaPo]"}

The unit is all plastic, and it is a glossy plastic that is very susceptible to fingerprints, scratches, etc. Shockingly, the rack ears are actually plastic as well and snap on the unit all flimsy-like. It is just a matter of time before these will break so you may want to just order a couple replacements sets in advance to be ready on that inevitable day.\n\n\nThe Second is just a detail, but if you use it with an external rack master power switch, you still have to manually turn it on each time as it won't automatically turn on when power is switched off and on externally.\n\n\nBut the Third, and the motivator of my review, is the buffered output. Unless you can use this in a scenario where you are feeding it from a dedicated Tuner Output from some other unit, or a splitter, etc, you may seriously want to consider a different tuner.\n\n\nWhen setup inline, inserted in your signal path, the buffered output is really cut-rate and just destroys the sound of your guitar - rolling highs and totally messing with the dynamics, killing clarity and definition - and not just a little! I first tested the unit at low living room volumes and even at low volume it was so noticeable I thought at first that something had changed on my amp's settings and kept checking my tone control to make sure it wasn't rolled down or something. After deducing that it was the tuner, I swapped cables, even swapped the unit with the second of the two I bought. Turned out the cause was the PB05 and both units did the same thing. Sure, it \"works\" inline, but you really can't use it that way in the real world without the large sacrifice of sounding like crap, something most self-respecting guitarists will be unlikely to do.\n\n\nIn my case, it's all good, as my final intended application can be setup with dedicated Tuner-Out feeds and I won't be utilizing the output - I'll just have to mute a different way. But were it not the case, and if these things didn't look as cool as they do, these would be going back in a heartbeat!\n\n\nPretty disappointed in KORG on this considering the high quality of sound and construction of their previous rack tuners that have served me well for countless years.

The court also ruled the company can deny those tips to assistant managers.\n\nThe ruling, responding to two lawsuits, backed Starbucks' policy of divvying up the tips, saying it's consistent with labor law.\n\nHospitality industry groups say the state court decision will be felt far beyond shops owned by Starbucks. and will affect 42,000 New York businesses statewide and a quarter-million hospitality industry workers in New York City alone.\n\nStarbucks baristas are part-time workers who serve customers and share tips weekly based on hours worked. They can be promoted after six months to shift supervisors.\n\nShift supervisors are also part-time wage workers who mostly serve customers, but also assign baristas, provide input on their performance and direct the flow of customers.\n\nAssistant managers are full-time, get some benefits such as paid holidays and vacations, and are eligible for bonuses.\n\nAttorney Adam Klein argued assistant managers spend most of their time serving customers and should get a share of the tip jar. Klein said his clients don't have the power to hire and fire, which he argued means they aren't \"company agents\" under labor law.\n\n\"Employees who regularly provide direct service to patrons remain tip-pool eligible even if they exercise a limited degree of supervisory responsibility,\" stated Judge Victoria Graffeo in writing the majority decision. \"But an employee granted meaningful authority or control over subordinates can no longer be considered similar to waiters and busboys … and, consequently, is not eligible to participate in a tip pool.\"\n\nSeattle-based Starbucks Corp. has nearly 18,000 retail stores in 60 countries. In April, it reported $3.6 billion in quarterly revenues.\n\nStarbucks had 413 company-owned stores in New York at the end of its last fiscal year. Company spokesman Zack Hutson said the tip policy is applied consistently across the U.S., though not globally because laws differ in other countries.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/16zA7ZK"}
{"text": "Already battling air pollution, Chinese authorities now want to tackle language pollution. At a symposium in Beijing this week attended by Sina, Tencent, and other internet companies, the head of the nation's cyberspace administration highlighted 25 examples of coarse language the government wants removed online.\n\nChina has long policed the internet, quietly blocking or detaining those who get too outspoken. Recently the government has become more public about efforts to patrol the internet for cyber crimes, with \"internet police\" opening social media accounts and even reaching out for followers.\n\nAs for bad language, China has about 650 million internet users, and apparently many of them are foul-mouthed. The 25 words highlighted by Lu Wei—chief of China's internet arbiter—were the most widely used \"vulgar terms\" on Sina Weibo, according to a recent study (link in Chinese) by the People's Daily.\n\nBut what Chinese authorities consider vulgar in Mandarin can sometimes seem curious, innocuous, or amusing in translation.\n\nConsider jiaoshou, which in its original form means \"professor.\" Switch the Chinese characters and you have something that is pronounced the same yet reads as \"howling monster.\" It is often used to call out experts who upset China's netizens.\n\nConnotations are also out. One of the 25 terms, nima, is a homonym for \"your mom,\" and it is an abbreviation of a three-word insult (the full insult, in English, includes putting a four-letter verb in front of \"your mom.\")\n\nSome phrases translate very well, like \"egg ache,\" where \"egg\" is the common way to refer to testicles. That describes something unreasonable that a person does out of extreme boredom.\n\nCertainly another term authorities want to ban, \"green tea bitch,\" will register as a profanity to many outside of China, but… green tea? The phrase is used to criticize a young woman who portrays herself as pure and innocent but uses her good looks to ruthlessly climb to power or success.\n\nThere are plenty in China who agree that such phrases are demeaning. Sina indicated it might add the offensive words to the filtering system on its Weibo microblogging platform, which would automatically remove any posts containing them.\n\nThere may be a more political agenda at work. The phrase containing a four-letter-word plus \"your mom\" actually has a complicated history in China: A pun on that phrase sounds very much like \"grass mud horse,\" a fictional animal that has become the de facto mascot of internet freedom in China. And diaosi, which used to mean \"good-for-nothing,\" has taken on a meaning closer to \"the powerless and downtrodden.\"\n\nZheping Huang contributed reporting."}

The California-headquartered company has announced 10 winners of its Hyperloop One Global Challenge, through which it sought to find teams that devise prototypes and feasible proposals of Hyperloop's high-speed transportation solution in their neighbourhood. Two winning teams are from India, the company said.\n\nThe company said teams that had built the prototype and conducted extensive research for the following routes have won. Bengaluru-Chennai (India), Mumbai-Chennai (India), Cheyenne-Denver-Pueblo (US), Chicago-Columbus-Pittsburgh (US); Miami-Orlando (US), Dallas-Houston (US), Edinburgh-London (UK), Glasgow-Liverpool (UK); Mexico City-Guadalajara (Mexico), and Toronto-Montreal Colorado Department of Transportation (Canada) are those routes. The two India routes were developed by AECOM India and Hyperloop India, respectively.\n\nHyperloop One said it will now work closely with each winning team to analyse their proposals and assess commercial viability. The company will also work with the teams to conduct business case, preliminary technical analysis of the route and corridor, and provide initial ridership forecasts.\n\n\"The Global Challenge became a movement of thousands of people from more than 100 countries over six continents. Like us, they believe that Hyperloop will not only solve transportation and urban development challenges within communities, it will unlock vast economic potential and transform how our cities operate and how we live. Our successful test this summer made Hyperloop a reality, and now we're ready to bring our Hyperloop system to the world,\" Shervin Pishevar, co-founder and executive chairman of Hyperloop One said.\n\nMore than 2,600 applicants had participated in the Hyperloop One Global Challenge, which began last year. The vast majority of applicants were from India, Pishevar said earlier this year during his trip to India, in which he met the then Railways minister Suresh Prabhu.\n\nEven as there is much time and work needed to be over before we finally know whether India would get Hyperloop One's high-speed trains - there is also regulatory and government approvals that are required, the prospect of the country ever getting these high-speed trains has many excited. A trip from Mumbai and Delhi by regular train takes a full day, for instance. The same trip on a Hyperloop One train would be over in less than an hour.\n\nInterestingly, Hyperloop Transport Technologies, the other company which is also trying to build solutions based on Elon Musk's vision, signed a memorandum of understanding with Andhra Pradesh government to conduct studies for the route between Vijayawada and Amaravati earlier this month."}

{"text": "If your yard is so badly flooded that quacking ducks are paddling gleefully under the clothesline, it's time to make some choices and get things under control. You can adopt the ducks and plant water lilies and a rice paddy, or you can remove the water. With nothing on hand but a garden hose, you may think you're up a proverbial creek without any oars. Not so -- that hose is worth its weight in gold as a siphon. Contrary to what you may have heard, you're not going to have to suck on the end of the hose to work a small miracle.\n\n1 Locate a receptacle -- a spot to deposit the unwanted water where it won't hurt anything else -- such as a street drain or a nearby ditch or culvert.\n\n2 Gather the hose into a loose coil. Drop one end of it into the middle of the flooded area.\n\n3 Take a step or two toward the receptacle and submerge the rest of the coiled hose completely. Hold it under the water until you don't see bubbles coming to the surface from either end, which indicates the hose is full of water. It now contains powerful suction action that's just waiting for a place to happen.\n\n4 Cover the hose end closest to you tightly with your palm to create a seal. This prevents water from leaking out of the hose and ruining the suction built up within it.\n\n5 Hold the hose end as low to the ground as you can and drag it toward the receptacle. Keep checking backward to make sure the flood end of the hose remains under water or your siphon won't work.\n\n6 Squat down at the receptacle. Lower the hose end as close to the ground as you can and point it at the receptacle. Remove your hand from the end of the hose. Water will gush out right away and will continue draining until the flood end is no longer submerged.\n\n7 Move the garden hose around to any other flooded areas of your yard and repeat as needed.\n\nWarning Pick up a middle section of the hose and keep it elevated while the water is running if the receptacle is at a higher ground level than the flood is. Once the siphoning process begins, the water molecules will continue to \"stick\" to each other and drag themselves out of the hose -- even uphill.\n\nAbout the Author A full-time writer since 2007, Axl J.

{"text": "This article first appeared on the Dorf on Law site.\n\nIt occurred to me when Comey was testifying yesterday to ask: \"You were the FBI Director. You had access to all sorts of gadgets. After your first uncomfortable meeting with Trump, why didn't you wear a wire in person and record your phone conversations with him?\"\n\nThat question in turn raised a legal question. Would it be legal?\n\nApparently yes. Washington, D.C. is a one-party consent jurisdiction, meaning that it is legal for a person to record his own conversation with someone else, even without the other person's consent.\n\nAs an article last month in Politifact explains, that means it's lawful for the president to record his conversations with others. It also works vice-versa, unless there is some federal law forbidding recording conversations with federal officials or the president in particular—but so far as I can tell, there isn't any such federal law.\n\nAs I said, I thought about this possibility while Comey was testifying, because I imagined that the White House response would be to cast doubt on Comey's version of events.\n\nI then thought that this expectation was justified when \"Predisent\" Trump's personal lawyer Marc Kasowitz released a clearly unproof-read letter that cherry-picked the parts of Comey's testimony he liked—Trump himself was not under FBI investigation (at least not prior to his interference with that investigation); Comey was the leaker of what Kasowitz described as \"privileged communications—while ignoring or contradicting the parts of Comey's testimony Kasowitz disliked—e.g. Trump's demand for loyalty.\n\nThe Kasowitz letter at least partly explains why Comey said that \"Lordy, I hope there are tapes.\" Tapes would presumably vindicate Comey's entire account.\n\nAnd then on Friday el Predisente tweeted that Comey's testimony provided \"total and complete vindication.\" Trump didn't bother to contradict anything Comey said, perhaps in tacit recognition that in a swearing contest the pathological liar is at a serious disadvantage. So maybe Comey didn't need to wear a wire after all.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that others don't.\n\nTrump's modus operandi when facing unpleasant accounts of his behavior is to deny it, to attack the character(s) of the source(s), to completely mischaracterize the account, to claim that his own behavior as described was not a big deal (e.g., \"locker-room talk\"), and to just claim vindication in general terms.\n\nWearing a wire won't protect against all of these moves, but it will protect against the first two.\n\nMichael C.

{"text": "Another major marijuana stereotype just got blown totally out of the water -- this time the idea that consuming cannabis is for unemployed slacker types. In fact, pot is wildly popular in one of America's economic centers, Silicon Valley. According to a new report in Bloomberg's Businessweek, the \"physical toll\" of computer coding has made Silicon Valley workers key consumers in the medical marijuana industry.\n\nIn San Jose, which Businessweek dubs the \"Bay Area capital of medical marijuana,\" 106 medicinal marijuana dispensaries span the city's 177 square miles, more than adequately serving its 967,000 residents. One of those dispensaries, Pallative Health Center, told Businessweek that tech workers make up an estimated 40 percent of clients.\n\n\"We're seeing people from some semiconductors, lots of engineers, lots of programmers,\" Ernie Arreola, 38, the assistant manager, told Businessweek, which noted, \"That makes sense, because the shop is an easy shot from some of the area's biggest employers—Cisco Systems, Google, Adobe Systems, Apple, EBay—and a short drive from dozens more. Also, people in Silicon Valley do like their pot.\"\n\nOne medical marijuana executive told Businessweek that marijuana-infused chocolate toffee is a favorite among tech workers, who he says represents about 15 percent of customers. \"It does not give the high or intoxicated feeling that you would typically get from a lot of medical cannabis,\" Doug Chloupek, CEO of MedMar Healing Center, told Businessweek. \"Those who are coding for 15 hours a day with cramping hands, that is the product that allows them to have mental clarity and still get pain relief.\"\n\nBut while Silicon Valley employees are getting stoned in a culture that embraces marijuana use, Businessweek notes policies forbidding drug use and possession at Cisco and Adobe, though neither company screens new employees for drug use. Maybe that's because, as Silicon Valley CEO Mark Johnson told Businessweek, \"Pot is an extremely functional drug. Coders can code on it, writers can write on it.\"\n\nStill, as Galen Moore notes at the Boston Business Journal, weed isn't the only drug popular in Silicon Valley:\n\nThe comments section on the tech news site Hacker News offer a glimpse into prescription drugs that are popular as work aids in Silicon Valley's high-tech culture, including so-called \"smart drugs\" Provigil (Modafinil) and Nuvigil, and pharmaceutical stimulants like Adderall and Ritalin.\n\nSome commenters also challenge Businessweek's assertion that marijuana culture is \"raging\" in Silicon Valley. It may be news to Businessweek, but the reality has always been that people from all ends of the social spectrum use drugs, pot especially. Not everybody, however, is arrested for it."}
{"text": "KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine on Tuesday accused pro-Russian separatists of taking advantage of a ceasefire deal signed last September to seize more territory in the east and said Kiev would demand its return in any future peace talks.\n\nForeign Minister Pavlo Klimkin's charge that the rebels had seized more than 500 square km (194 square miles) beyond agreed separation lines opened up a potential new area of discord with Russia in diplomacy aimed at ending the nine-month-old conflict.\n\nAt talks under the auspices of the OSCE security watchdog in the Belarussian capital Minsk last September, Ukraine, Russia and separatist leaders agreed a plan which included a ceasefire and a withdrawal of foreign fighters and military equipment.\n\nSubsequent meetings established the separation lines between government forces and the separatists, whom the West and Kiev say are armed by the Russian military, a charge Moscow denies.\n\nDespite the ceasefire call, the Kiev military says more than 200 Ukrainian soldiers and hundreds of civilians have been killed since September.\n\nThe separatists have sought to dislodge government forces from the international airport in the rebel-controlled city of Donetsk, an important symbol for both sides in a conflict which has killed more than 4,800 people.\n\nOther areas where Ukrainians say they have lost territory to the rebels are in the southeast towards Mariupol, by the Sea of Azov, and around Debaltseve, a rail hub northeast of Donetsk.

{"text": "Today is Data Privacy Day (known as Data Protection Day in Europe). In the age of the data breach, with cyber security intrusions seeming to take place on a near weekly basis, it seems hardly necessary to designate a day to emphasize the importance of protecting data and data privacy. And while most companies recognize that cyber security technology is an indispensable tool in preventing breaches, data policies, employee training and other business controls are necessary for it to be most effective.\n\nBasics for Businesses\n\nIn addition to implementing technological solutions, a few simple considerations can help keep data breaches at bay.\n\n- Know Where Your Data is and What's Important\n\nNot all data is created equal. It's critical to determine WHAT and WHERE your data is before deciding how best to protect it. Decide what data is most valuable to the business – for some that could patient records, for other intellectual property – classifying it from most to least important, THEN make determinations as to where that data should be kept on the network, who should have access to it, and how.\n\n- Put Role Based Access Controls in Place\n\nNot everyone needs access to all pieces of information. Your human resources department has a legitimate business need to attain certain employee data, like salary and evaluation reports, but it's unlikely the purchasing department should need equal access to such records. Limit access to specific data only to those who require it to perform their required job role.\n\n- Implement Data Handling Processes and Educate Your Employees on What They are\n\nPut polices on the handling of data in place and communicate it to employees. This includes instructing them on how data should be stored and shared based on its classification (using password protection or encryption, for instance) and making sure they have the technology and training to comply with the required rules and guidelines.\n\nCounsel for Costumers and Consumers\n\nWe expect organizations that store our data – like payment information, banking details, purchasing choices and personal specifics – to do so responsibly and to keep that data secure. But being cognizant of our own user behavior in relation to that data can go a long way to keeping us even more secure.\n\nFor instance: Always confirm the name and IP address before logging on, and unless you're certain of the source don't click on links in email. When typing in web addresses in email, look for HTTPS (at the start of the web address) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) which ensures data passed between devices and web servers is encrypted.

{"text": "Montreal, CA – The city council of Montreal recently voted to ban ownership of pit bulls, causing outrage from dog lovers everywhere.\n\nBy: John Vibes\n\nThis article first appeared at FreeThoughtProject\n\nThe measure was voted by a 37-23 majority, in response to controversy caused by a random dog attack, which was an isolated incident.\n\nMayor Denis Coderre issued a statement after the vote saying, \"My duty as mayor of Montreal is making sure I am working for all Montrealers. And I am there to make sure they feel safe and that they are safe.\"\n\nThe new law will go into effect starting on October 3rd, and will effectively ban new ownership of any pit bull or \"pit bull type dogs.\"\n\nThe law says that the following breeds will be marked as \"pit bull type dogs.\"\n\n-Staffordshire bull terriers.\n\n-American pit bull terriers.\n\n-American Staffordshire terriers.\n\n-Any mix with these breeds.\n\n-Any dog that presents characteristics of one of those breeds.\n\nThere is a court appeal planned by those who are objecting to the new measure.\n\nThe Montreal SPCA is among the groups pushing a court challenge of the law, saying that this could lead to the deaths of countless innocent animals.\n\n\"If the city of Montreal truly wanted to ensure public safety, it would not have forced a rushed adoption of controversial legislation which is unfair, unenforceable, and, most importantly, ineffective,\" the agency said in a statement.\n\nAccording to the CBC, those who now own a dog of those breeds in Montreal will have to acquire a special permit in order to keep their pet by Dec. 31, 2016. Those who fail to acquire a permit will have their dog taken and killed after the law goes into effect.\n\nThe fine print of the law even says that a pit bull must be automatically euthanized when their owner dies.\n\nWhile there has traditionally been heavy debate over larger breeds of dogs, in recent years, the debate has died down. An overwhelming majority of people now agree that like humans, a dog's temperament and personality are largely based on their upbringing and life experiences.\n\nIn fact, a recent study conducted at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Sciences showed that a dog's upbringing, not its breed, is responsible for aggression.\n\nThe study was published in the journal Applied Animal Behaviour Science in 2014, and was called Human directed aggression in domestic dogs (Canis familiaris): Occurrence in different contexts and risk factors.\"\n\nThe study surveyed 14,000 dog owners in the U.K and found that the dog's environment was entirely responsible for its aggressive tenancies.\n\nThis article first appeared at FreeThoughtProject"}

Source: University of Arkansas\n\nAccording to projections, almost half of the expected job openings will be in management and business, with another 27% in fields related to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Jobs in sustainable food and biomaterials production will make up 15%, while 12% will be in education, communication and government services.\n\nProjections are based on data from several sources. The Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts a 10.8% increase in the U.S. labor force from 2012 to 2022 due to job growth and openings from retirement or other replacements. Employment opportunities in food, agriculture, renewable natural resources and environmental occupations are expected to grow more than 5% during 2015-20 for college graduates with bachelor's degrees or higher.\n\nSTEM areas are expected to see stronger job markets for plant scientists, food scientists, sustainable biomaterials specialists, water resources scientists and engineers, precision agriculture specialists and farm-animal veterinarians.\n\nA strong market is also expected for e-commerce managers and marketing agents, ecosystem managers, agricultural educators, crop advisors and pest control specialists.\n\nThe University of Arkansas' Career Development Center has tracked and seen steady growth in recent years of the number of agricultural companies recruiting on campus and engaging with our students.\n\nAn average of 35,400 new U.S. graduates with expertise in food, agriculture, renewable natural resources or the environment are expected to fill 61% of the more than 57,000 average annual openings. Most employers prefer graduates with this expertise, but because more annual openings are anticipated than can be filled by graduates, employers may look to areas such as biology, business administration, engineering, education, communication, and consumer sciences to fill the remaining 39%.\n\nThe report says graduates in these areas are essential to meet growing challenges in the U.S., but also globally, to provide leadership in providing sustainable food systems, adequate water resources and renewable energy in a world of population growth and climate change.\n\nGraduates who are mobile, have work experience, and have technical and professional skills will have more options if they are willing to seek employment in other states or countries. Graduates who have completed internships or work experiences related to the jobs they apply for are more likely to be hired, according to the report."}

For example, in winter of 2017, when the average temperature was 2.95 degree Celsius higher than the 1901-30 baseline, the worst drought in a century happened in southern India, in which Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala were worst-hit, with 330 million coming in the grip of drought,\" the CSE study said.\n\nIt pointed out that 13 of the 15 warmest years were in the past 15 years (2002-16) and the last decade (2001-10 and 2007-16) were the warmest on record. It said the annual mean temperature in India had risen by about 1.2 degrees since the beginning of the 20th century.\n\n\"Annual mean temperature in India has rapidly increased since 1995. At this rate of increase, it will breach the 1.5 degrees mark within the next two decades.\"\n\nEfforts to restrict the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius was the aspirational target set under the Paris Agreement.\n\n\"With the US exiting the Paris Agreement, controlling emissions and temperature is now a tougher task for the world. We appeal to the global community to come together and take strong actions,\" said Sunita Narain, the CSE Director General.\n\nThe study asserted that in three out of four seasons (or nine months in a year), temperature in India had already increased by more than 1.5 degree Celsius since the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nIt is only during the monsoon months that the temperature increase is about one degree.\n\nThe CSE said that while 2016 was the second warmest year in India, the summers of 2010, when the average temperature was 2.05 degrees higher than the baseline, was the highest in recorded history.\n\n\"These conditions claimed more than 300 lives. In addition, four cyclonic storms hit India that year (2010).\n\n\"India is warming and warming rapidly.

{"text": "A new product has hit the market, and it's causing some controversy. Powdered alcohol, or \"palcohol,\" is the latest trend in alcohol and has left many detractors wondering why such a product needs to exist. These alcoholic powders are packaged in silver pouches that look very similar to a child's drink pouch. They come in flavors like Lemon Drop, Cosmopolitan, vodka, and rum, presenting concerns of their potential to increase the rate of alcohol misuse and abuse.\n\nWhat is Powdered Alcohol and Why is It Controversial?\n\nThe technology behind creating powdered alcohol has existed since 1972 and consists of an admittedly fascinating process of dehydration using chemicals known as \"cyclodextrins,\" compounds made up of highly absorbent sugar molecules. Cyclodextrins can be used to convert liquids to solid powders.\n\nA recent patent for \"palcohol\" was approved by the Food & Drug Administration in March 2014, and it's created an uproar for those concerned about what they perceive as another unnecessary alcoholic product. Critics include Senator Charles Schumer, who compared the product to \"Kool-Aid for underage drinking.\"\n\nWhat Does \"Palcohol\" Mean for the Future of Cannabis?\n\nIf cyclodextrins can be used to absorb alcohol into a concentrated powder form, who's to say it couldn't do the same for cannabis? As it is, cannabis has a very low solubility rate in water, which decreases its uses and effectiveness as a pharmaceutical product.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of a cyclodextrin compound (specifically, a hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin solution combined with hydroxypropylmethylcellulose – whoa, having flashbacks to high school chemistry!), the solubility of THC increases a thousand times over. If cyclodextrin can be used to make a substance with major potential for abuse, it can also be used to increase the effectiveness and usefulness of cannabis. By increasing the solubility of cannabis, it could be sold in more concentrated forms, with more consistent doses for the medical patients who need it.\n\nAn obvious concern with manufacturing concentrated powdered forms of cannabis is, as with \"palcohol,\" the increased potential for abuse. While higher concentrations of cannabis can serve a clear medicinal benefit to qualified patients seeking treatment for conditions such as chronic pain or appetite loss, the risk of unregulated access can fuel the anti-legalization fire. That's not to say this type of technological innovation shouldn't be retooled for cannabis applications — we just need to approach it in a cautious, safe, effective manner to ensure that this evolved product is being used appropriately. Instead of creating a product that can be ripe for abuse, let's encourage the thoughtful, regulated, and tested development of a product that could help patients everywhere.\n\n#JustSayKnow"}

Bain had allowed the five supporters to stay the night, and they were discovered dead early this morning, each in different rooms and with fresh bullet wounds.\n\nPolice say that the lone survivor of the killings, David Bain, was horrified to discover the men's bodies after returning home from his morning paper round.\n\nBain says he entered the home at around 8:20am, before absent-mindedly walking past several of the deceased on his way to the laundry. Here he discovered a pile of bloodied clothes, which he carefully washed before returning to his living room to fully realise that all his friends were dead.\n\nBain then made a frantic 111 call, telling the operator \"Help. They're all dead. My friends, they're all dead.

{"text": "Wrong. In 2004, two economists looked into whether more sexual variety led to greater well-being. They looked at data from about 16,000 adult Americans who were asked confidentially how many sex partners they had had in the preceding year, and about their happiness. Across men and women alike, the data show that the optimal number of partners is one.\n\nThis might seem totally counterintuitive. After all, we are unambiguously driven to accumulate material goods, to seek fame, to look for pleasure. How can it be that these very things can give us unhappiness instead of happiness? There are two explanations, one biological and the other philosophical.\n\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, it makes sense that we are wired to seek fame, wealth and sexual variety. These things make us more likely to pass on our DNA. Had your cave-man ancestors not acquired some version of these things (a fine reputation for being a great rock sharpener; multiple animal skins), they might not have found enough mating partners to create your lineage.\n\nBut here's where the evolutionary cables have crossed: We assume that things we are attracted to will relieve our suffering and raise our happiness. My brain says, \"Get famous.\" It also says, \"Unhappiness is lousy.\" I conflate the two, getting, \"Get famous and you'll be less unhappy.\"\n\nBut that is Mother Nature's cruel hoax. She doesn't really care either way whether you are unhappy — she just wants you to want to pass on your genetic material. If you conflate intergenerational survival with well-being, that's your problem, not nature's. And matters are hardly helped by nature's useful idiots in society, who propagate a popular piece of life-ruining advice: \"If it feels good, do it.\" Unless you share the same existential goals as protozoa, this is often flat-out wrong.\n\nMore philosophically, the problem stems from dissatisfaction — the sense that nothing has full flavor, and we want more. We can't quite pin down what it is that we seek. Without a great deal of reflection and spiritual hard work, the likely candidates seem to be material things, physical pleasures or favor among friends and strangers.\n\nWe look for these things to fill an inner emptiness. They may bring a brief satisfaction, but it never lasts, and it is never enough. And so we crave more. This paradox has a word in Sanskrit: upadana, which refers to the cycle of craving and grasping. As the Dhammapada (the Buddha's path of wisdom) puts it: \"The craving of one given to heedless living grows like a creeper. Like the monkey seeking fruits in the forest, he leaps from life to life... Whoever is overcome by this wretched and sticky craving, his sorrows grow like grass after the rains.\""}

Since three months ago I'm waiting for a call from the legal department to clarify the breach of contract on your part and they never call me, every time I call to Sprint they told me they called me but it is not true! I never spoke with anybody or they nither never let me a message with a phone number to call back.\n\nYou have changed the terms of service and lease without my authorization and now you increase the balance in my account. I've called you for the last three months, I talked with supervisors who treated very rude the customers, some of them hanging off the phone, for example, today 8/13/18 around 10 pm after been waiting almost an hour on the phone, the supervisor Andres (1444509566 reference number). Your staff asks too much protocol and, at the end, they do whatever they want, and they put in the system anything the most they like it.\n\nMy frustration on the phone gets bigger every day and then they ask patience and calm, and I ask myself how long I will have to be calm? and when I'm going to solve the problem?\n\nI've been losing work hours for three months that are clearly in the call records. Last month I went directly to the store where I bought the phones, I talked to the supervisor but, he couldn't do anything, he told me that I have to wait until they call me but still today they have not called me yet.\n\n\nAnother thing from you is that you record all calls, nevertheless, you don't allow clients to record their's, what would be very beneficial to prove everything I've mentioned before, the quality of calls, in addition to your horrible and very bad customer service. All of this seems to me like an act of arbitrariness on your part.\n\n\nYou have to stop treating your clients like that, you can't change without authorization the word and promise of service you gave to those one day trusted you, isn't correct, it is contract violation!\n\n\nI am willing to comply with what we agreed, but I will not allow changes to my account, no matter how small they are, and much less without my authorization, you don't know if I can make those changes, you don't know my economic situation either, nor the children that I have to keep.\n\nI will only pay what we agreed, not a penny more and I will get to the court if necessary but I will not allow it!\n\n\nI hope you have the sensitivity to serve your customers who are the ones who feed you.

{"text": "Stress often drives us to pursue a reward (dessert, drink, new 'toy') more intensely, but new Swiss research has found that we're no more likely to enjoy the indulgence than an unstressed person with the same treat.\n\nThe findings are published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Learning and Cognition.\n\n\"Most of us have experienced stress that increases our craving for rewarding experiences, such as eating a tasty bar of chocolate, and it can make us invest considerable effort in obtaining the object of our desire, such as running to a convenience store in the middle of the night,\" said lead author Eva Pool, M.S., a doctoral student at the University of Geneva.\n\n\"But while stress increases our desire to indulge in rewards, it does not necessarily increase the enjoyment we experience.\"\n\nDuring the study, stress prompted chocolate lovers to exert three times as much effort to smell chocolate than unstressed chocolate lovers, and yet both groups reported similar levels of enjoyment when they got a whiff of the pleasing aroma.\n\nResearchers recruited 36 male and female university students who said they love chocolate. To induce stress, the participants were asked to keep one hand in ice-cold water while being observed and videotaped. Another group immersed a hand in lukewarm water.\n\nTen minutes before and 30 minutes after the experiment, researchers collected samples of the students' saliva and tested them for levels of cortisol, a stress hormone.\n\nFinally, all subjects had to press a handgrip for the chance to smell chocolate when they saw a certain symbol. The researchers measured their efforts at the chance to smell chocolate and asked then participants how pleasant they found the odor.\n\n\"Stress plays a critical role in many psychological disorders and is one of the most important factors determining relapses in addiction, gambling, and binge eating,\" said another author, Tobias Brosch, Ph.D., also of the University of Geneva.\n\n\"Stress seems to flip a switch in our functioning: If a stressed person encounters an image or a sound associated with a pleasant object, this may drive them to invest an inordinate amount of effort to obtain it.\"\n\nPrior studies with laboratory rats support the idea that wanting and enjoying depend on two distinct networks of neurons that can be activated independently.\n\n\"Although the findings with rodents provide a novel explanation for the stress-induced increase of reward pursuits, to the best of our knowledge, they have never been demonstrated in humans,\" the study said.\n\nMore research on people is necessary to confirm the findings, according to the authors, who recommend future studies that would explore the effect of more intense everyday life stressors on human wanting and enjoying.\n\nSource: American Psychological Association\n\nWoman wanting a donut photo by shutterstock.\n\nStress Increases Desire for Reward, But Pleasure Remains the Same"}

But that doesn't mean she needs to step down, he said.\n\n\"I think we ought to let the judicial system play out,\" said Wolf, leader of the state's Democrats. \"We have procedures in place for adjudicating the rights and wrongs . . . and I think we ought to let those procedures play out.\"\n\nKane has deflected calls to resign as Montgomery County District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman weighs whether to charge her with perjury, obstruction, contempt of court, and other crimes in the leaking of secret information to a Philadelphia newspaper, allegedly to punish a political rival. A statewide grand jury recommended that Kane be charged.\n\nKane's attorney and private spokesman, Lanny Davis, said last week that Kane was innocent and the victim of \"cowardly\" people working behind the scenes to destroy her. Davis has blamed \"angry Republican men\" who he said are upset at her political ascent and have plotted to bring her down.\n\nThe editorial boards of news outlets across the state have urged Kane to resign. She has said she will not.\n\nIn such editorials last week, The Inquirer and PennLive/the Harrisburg Patriot-News cited her handling of two major criminal investigations since taking office. In 2013, The Inquirer reported, Kane shut down an undercover sting operation that captured elected Democrats from Philadelphia accepting cash or gifts. Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams resurrected the case, charging six people.\n\nLast week, the paper reported that sources and documents indicate Kane also undermined an investigation into a state Gaming Board lawyer with ties to politically connected Scranton billionaire Louis DeNaples. After the case withered, DeNaples contributed $25,000 to Kane's campaign. She later returned the contribution.\n\nIn Tuesday's interview, Wolf stressed that he was not a lawyer, but said he believed that Kane, in her time as attorney general, has had to make decisions on some tough cases.\n\n\"The extent to which she has done that the right or wrong way will be determined by the court,\" he said.\n\nHe said he had not had any discussions with Kane about her legal problems, and that no one has asked him to speak with her about resigning for the good of the party or the integrity of her office.\n\n\"It hasn't happened,\" Wolf said. \"I don't know who would make that call.\""}

Things are just fine, they're getting better.' Well, they're not,\" Illinois Gov.

Rauner said that could prompt local officials to evacuate some neighborhoods and communities.\n\nHeavy rainfall that hit the Midwest on Wednesday knocked out power to thousands and closed roadways. Power outages caused by flooding forced the evacuation Wednesday of Lake Forest Hospital in suburban Chicago. Power was restored that night, but Northwestern Medicine says the hospital remained closed Friday while damaged infrastructure is restored.\n\nWisconsin Gov.

The resort now encompasses two parks (Disneyland and Disney Sea), three themed hotels and countless rides, restaurants and attractions.\n\nWe were lucky enough to visit the park last Halloween and it is one of the world's best kept secrets: the attention to detail, cleanliness and overall experience were absolutely phenomenal. As a tribute we've dedicated this week's Throwback Thursday to Tokyo Disneyland and, from all of us here at Maison Mouse, we wish the park a magical 30th anniversary!\n\nWhen you enter Disneyland you find yourself in the World Bazaar, as opposed to Main Street, although it is similarly filled with shops and cafes and Cinderella's castle is directly ahead of you. One of the things we loved about the Tokyo park, though, was that the name of each shop and its window displays always reflect what the store sells: in this case, of course, Town Center Fashions is a clothing store.\n\nBut before we caught sight of the store's name, we saw its window and could not look away: in the window were life-size versions of four Disney Princess gowns and they were breathtaking. We wished so hard that these dresses were available to buy inside but, sadly (and for obvious reasons), they were display only. The full window scene actually depicts Minnie Mouse (not pictured here) as a seamstress in her sewing room, measuring up a dress for Cinderella, who is peering around the door. Inside the workroom there are dresses for Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Snow White (below).\n\nThe level of detail in this one window display alone – from the wallpaper to the birds assisting with Cinderella's dress – is incredible, especially when you stop to consider that this is one of the hundreds (if not thousands) of window displays all around the park, each as carefully decorated as the next. We also love the opulent material used to re-create each dress, turning the fantasy on the screen into realistic, period-looking pieces.\n\nHere's one last anecdote we'll share with you about the window displays. Because we were visiting the park for Halloween, almost all the window displays were filled with the most impressive themed decorations. But as the clock struck midnight on 31 October, the entire park transformed from Halloween-themed to Christmas-themed. We know this because we left the park late on the night of the 31st, having fully enjoyed the Halloween celebrations, and when we arrived back at the park on the morning of 1 November every single Halloween decoration (down to the Halloween-themed trashcans) had been removed and most of the park's Christmas decorations were already up, including window displays and stores full of Christmas merchandise. We still have no idea how they did it so fast and in such little time but it was truly magical!"}

We'll share when that's open.\n\nHere's a look at what's in store for Moebius Models in 2017:\n\n[UPDATE June 12]\n\nMoebius Models has one more San Diego Comic-Con up their metaphorical sleeves: Frazetta's Death Dealer Lapel Pin (Set of Four). Just like the amazingly detailed styrene kit below, this pin set is based on the painting by fantasy artist Frank Frazette. The set comes with four metal lapel pins, including a Frazetta signature pin, a Death Dealer gothic frame pin, a Death Dealer sculpted pin, and a Death Dealer parchment pin. The pins measure from 1.5″-2″.\n\n[UPDATE May 27]\n\nSomething sinister is coming — but there's no need to fear. The first of Moebius Models' San Diego Comic-Con exclusives is a 1:10 scale styrene kit of Death Dealer, based on the classic painting by legendary fantasy artist Frank Frazetta. The 10″ kit features the ominous character on his mighty steed, and is molded in Midnight Black. It also includes a unique numbered signature sleeve signed by Frank Frazetta, Jr., the son of the artist, as well as a detailed display base, and real metal chains. It will retail for $70.\n\nIf you loved last year's awesome Batman v Super battle pose set, then Moebius Models has something else for you to add to your collection with the Batman v Superman Batwing 1/25 Scale Model. Unlike the previous exclusive, this one comes fully assembled and fully painted. It features a highly detailed, accurate recreation of the Batwing, measuring over 17″ long and 17″ wide.\n\nWhen you purchase the styrene Batwing for $150, you'll also get a screen-printed carrying bag.\n\nNext up from Moebius Models is a San Diego Comic-Con exclusive you probably don't want helping to pilot your spacecraft — a 2001: A Space Odyssey Hal 9000 Lapel Pin, which retails for just $8, and features the ominous HAL 9000 interface as seen in the film. It measures 2″ high, and features a secure butterfly clasp."}

With the pressures of TLC SSDs squeezing the value market we take a look and see if a standard MLC SSD with 19nm Toshiba Toggle NAND and an SF-2281 processor can keep up with the changing times.\n\nAS SSD is the premier SSD only benchmark. Used widely, it does a good job of keeping the results simple, yet relevant. The benchmark tests with incompressible data, so it doesn't always give a fair shake to drives that rely upon compression for speed.\n\nAS SSD includes a compression benchmark built into the utility. This does an excellent job of addressing the performance with varying levels of compression. It should be taken into consideration that AS SSD measures latency at a 512b file size, when 4k QD1 is actually the industry accepted method.\n\nThe AS SSD benchmark illustrates the lower performed with incompressible data that all SandForce drives exhibit. The sequential write speed is considerably lower than the speeds we witnessed in the HDTune testing.\n\nAS SSD Write testing highlights one of the undesirable characteristics of smaller capacity SSDs: lower write speed\n\nAS SSD Read measurements reflect the good incompressible sequential speed, but also illustrates that high random loading will suffer from having fewer dice to spread the commands across.\n\nAS SSD Copy benchmark illustrates the speed of processing various files in a copy scenario. The V300 performs well in this real-world emulation of incompressible file usage.\n\nAS SSD Compression testing illustrates the performance of the SSD at varying levels of compression.\n\nPower Testing is very important, as the lower power appetite for SSDs is a big motivator for users with mobile devices, such as laptops and notebooks, to purchase a new SSD. The promise of longer battery life, while not always guaranteed, is very tempting for many users. We have tested the SSDs at various settings, with high QD (32) to show the maximum power draw for each scenario. More often than not for mundane tasks such as surfing the net the SSD will be very close to idle power.\n\nThe Kingston SSDNow V300 SSD scores well across the gamut of tests, though we must take into consideration that lower capacity results in less NAND that needs powered. The power results do reflect that this SSD would be a good choice for a notebook or laptop."}
{"text": "The Apsara Authority on Saturday threatened to take legal action against the individuals behind a series of photographs showing a woman posing topless at the Angkor Archaeological Park in Siem Reap City, calling the images \"inconsiderate and pornographic.\"\n\nThe photos, which drew the ire of many Cambodian Facebook users who shared them over the weekend, show an Asian woman standing among temples in the park wearing harem pants, a headscarf and nothing else. The images were originally posted to the \"Wanimal\" photography blog—which features photos of nude or partially nude women, often posing in public places—in October 2013 with the caption \"Khmer Lady.\"\n\n\"Wtf …..,I wanna kill her from now,\" commented one Facebook user on Saturday.\n\nIn a more diplomatic tone, the Apsara Authority, the government body that manages the archaeological park, also denounced the images on the same day.\n\n\"The Apsara Authority strongly condemns the half-naked body of the woman standing in front of the temples, because taking naked photos is an act that is totally against Khmer ethics and culture,\" the authority says in a statement.\n\n\"The Apsara Authority…has decided to take legal measures by any means in order to punish the inconsiderate and pornographic act.\"\n\nThe authority derives its name from a French acronym that spells out \"APSARA,\" a reference to the celestial nymphs of Hindu and Buddhist mythology. Apsaras are often depicted in paintings, carvings and sculpture as bare-breasted women; the authority features one such bare-breasted apsara image on its website.\n\nLong Kosal, deputy director of the Apsara Authority's communications department, said Sunday that the photos appear to have been taken at the Preah Khan and Banteay Kdei temples.\n\n\"Based on our initial research, we found that this group is based in China and is skilled in producing pornographic pictures,\" he said.\n\nMr. Kosal said the Apsara Authority had not yet identified the photographer or model, who he insisted was not Cambodian.\n\nRy Anhchealy, deputy director of the provincial department of culture and fine arts, said that photographs and other depictions of shirtless females at the temples were inappropriate, regardless of the fact that many of the temples are adorned with carvings of topless women.\n\n\"That happened 1,000 years ago, so we don't want to comment on it, but you are asking me in 2015, so this is a different matter…. It is wrong.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Ben Woods)\n\n[email protected]\n\n© 2015, The Cambodia Daily. All rights reserved.

{"text": "A new speed record by the Sunswift Australian solar racing team for the fastest electric vehicle over a distance of 500 km has been officially recognized. Their vehicle eVe can achieve more than 100 km/h.\n\nThe official mark of the new speed record is 106.966 km/h. The previous one of 73 km/h had stood for 26 years.\n\nThe main advantage of eVe is that it is not only an electric car, but uses solar power too. The car uses solar panels on the roof and also has a hood to charge a 60kg battery. However, the panels were switched off during the world-record attempt, leaving the car to run solely on the battery charge. According to the engineers, eVe can cover 800km from a single charge.\n\nThe world record was unofficially broken on July 23 at a racetrack in Geelong, Victoria, Australia. However, the record in this field must be officially approved by the International Automobile Federation (FIA), which is the world motorsport's governing body. And, finally, in October the organization issued a new update of the records and approved the Sunswift team's achievement.\n\nSunswift was founded in 1996 and it's Australia's top solar car racing team. This record is not their first. They have already set a world record for the fastest solar powered road trip from Perth to Sydney, and a Guinness World Record for the fastest solar car.\n\nMore than 100 students at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) have contributed to the record attempt over the past two years.\n\n\"It's not often you can confidently say you made history before you even graduated,\" Sunswift's project director and undergraduate engineering student Hayden Smith said in a statement.\n\nWith an official world record the team can now concentrate on a new challenge, which is to modify their car to meet road registration requirements. Smith said the car could be registered and appear on city streets within a year. The team is sure the car is ready for everyday use.\n\n\"Five hundred kilometers is pretty much as far as a normal person would want to drive in a single day,\" Smith said. \"It's another demonstration that one day you could be driving our car.\"\n\n\"We've always wanted to keep pushing the cultural change towards electric vehicles, and this is another big step in that direction,\" he added. \"This record was about establishing a whole new level of single-charge travel for high-speed electric vehicles, which we hope will revolutionize the electric car industry.\"\n\nUNSW officials also expressed their feeling concerning the record.\n\nUNSW Engineering Dean Professor Graham Davies said that for a student project to achieve a new world record for electric vehicle speed and endurance \"is truly remarkable.\"\n\n\"It goes to show what exceptional students we have here at UNSW.\""}

{"text": "It typically takes around two hours to charge your iPhone from dead to fully juiced up. But what if you got your hands on a magical battery that could do it in seconds?\n\nThis could actually be a reality with a new nanomaterial called MXene.\n\nThe material is the product of research from Drexel University, headed by materials science and engineering professor Yury Gogotsi.\n\nThe nanomaterial differs from traditional batteries because it opens up more paths for ions to move quickly throughout the material.\n\nThe revolutionary electrode design uses a two-dimensional material called MXene to enable this proceess. Electrodes are the places where energy is stored in batteries for charging, so a change here can really morph the entire battery composition and charging process as we know it.\n\nAt a basic level, MXene is a hydrogel squished between oxide metal. It's highly conductive, like the copper and aluminum used in electrical wires, allowing ions to move through it very quickly.\n\nThis is what the MXene material looks like. Image: College of engineering/drexel university\n\nTraditional batteries that we're used to using have a much slower process than MXene. This is because there's a limited path for ions to get to the ports, where they are then ready to charge your device.\n\nMXeme is revolutionary because it creates multiple paths for the ions to travel through, meaning more of them can get to the charging ports at a much quicker rate. They can move quickly because of MXene's composition itself. The high conductivity helps the ions to move along without a lot of resistance. On top of that, there are also more ports than in traditional batteries and supercapacitors. This means there are more places for ions to enter and leave the battery, bringing it to a whole new level of efficiency.\n\nThe research team at Drexel University has actually been working with the nanomaterial since 2011, but in slightly different use cases — namely, electromagnetic radiation shielding and water filtering. But the team is now exploring more about how MXene can revolutionize batteries in everyday appliances and gadgets.\n\nThe scientific breakthrough could mean much more than quicker phone charging times. Professor Gogotsi believes that MXene's application in the real world will also lead to better laptop and electric car batteries. And not in the realm of a slight increase in efficiency, but charging rates being reduced from hours to minutes and seconds.\n\nIt might still be a couple of years before the production of MXene is scaled up enough to make a real difference. But the fact alone that there's a material out there with the capacity to revolutionize charging this much is mind blowing in itself. So, whether we see MXene batteries in our everyday devices tomorrow or three years from now, it's still something we very much look forward to."}
{"text": "© unknown\n\nThe Justice Department is funding an unusual national training program to help police deal with an increasing number of volatile confrontations involving highly trained and often heavily armed combat veterans.Developers of the pilot program, to be launched at 15 U.S. sites this year, said\"We just can't use the blazing-guns approach anymore when dealing with disturbed individuals who are highly trained in all kinds of tactical operations, including guerrilla warfare,\" said Dennis Cusick, executive director of the Upper Midwest Community Policing Institute. \"That goes beyond the experience of SWAT teams.\"Cusick, who is developing the program along with institute training director William Micklus, said local authorities have a better chance of defusing violent confrontations by immediately engaging suspects in discussions about their military experience -- not with force.The aim, Micklus said, is to try to reconnect them with \"a sense of integrity\" lost in the fog of emotional distress.\"You can't win by trying to out-combat them,'' Cusick said. \"You emphasize what it means to be a Marine, a soldier to people who now feel out of control.\"There is no data that specifically tracks police confrontations with suspects currently or formerly associated with the military. But an Army report issued this year found that violent felonies in the service were up 1% while non-violent felonies increased 11% between 2010 and 2011.During that time, however, crime in much of the nation declined.\"What we're seeing is that the volume (of violent incidents involving military personnel off base) has ratcheted up to a level we have never seen before,\" Cusick said.Much of the anecdotal evidence reads like the report of the Jan. 13 standoff between Army Staff Sgt. Joshua Eisenhauer, 30, a veteran of multiple combat tours, and Fayetteville, N.C., police and firefighters.A 911 call from an apartment complex manager revealed that Eisenhauer was allegedly barricaded inside one of the apartments exchanging gunfire with police.Although the suspect was not specifically identified as a soldier, the apartment manager told a police dispatcher that the suspect was \"under psychiatric care,\" according to the 911 call.According to Fort Bragg records, Eisenhauer had been assigned to the post's Warrior Transition Battalion, a unit for soldiers who have been wounded or suffered other illnesses as a result of their deployment, Womack Army Medical Center spokeswoman Shannon Lynch said.Eisenhauer, who was wounded in the standoff along with two police officers, is charged with 30 criminal counts, including 15 counts of attempted murder.Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities (Police) Chiefs Association, said the type of training proposed by the Justice Department represents \"one piece of the challenge'' in dealing with an increasing number of mentally ill suspects.\"This has been a challenge for a number of years in our communities,\" Stephens said.Source: USA Today"}
{"text": "Close\n\nUS Internet revealed that it has launched the fastest Internet connection in the world to the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. While the verification of the claim is difficult, the connection is definitely the fastest broadband connection being offered in the United States.\n\nUS Internet is offering a 10 Gbps fiber connection to residents and businesses within its coverage area, as the company is based just to the west of Minneapolis.\n\nThe 10 Gbps speed of the broadband connection, which will be for both downloading an uploading, is over 300 times faster compared to the average connection speeds in the United States, which is currently 30 Mbps according to Ookla.\n\nVerizon and Google are both testing 10 Gbps connection speeds, but neither company has made the technology available to consumers. It seems that US Internet has beaten both major tech companies in introducing the breakthrough technology, albeit to a very limited market.\n\n\"With our new fiber network, we have redefined what is considered broadband Internet and taken our speed capabilities to next-gen levels, resulting in the fastest Internet service the world has ever seen for home users,\" said US Internet co-CEO Joe Caldwell.\n\nThe 10 Gbps connection will not come cheap though, as the service will cost a monthly fee of $399. This is a significant increase compared to the next option for US Internet customers, which is a 1 Gbps fiber connection for $65 per month.\n\nHowever, for customers living in Minneapolis, the only other options for Internet providers are Comcast and Century Link, both of which do not offer connections anywhere near as fast as what US Internet is offering. Both companies don't offer fiber connections at all.\n\nCustomers included in the coverage area that are willing to pay for the massive Internet speed upgrade will have to wait though. The technology being used for the 10 Gbps connection is fiber technology, homes and buildings are required to be wired in a unique way, as the connection is not as simple as plugging in wires to a box.\n\nThe issue lies in the installation process of the fiber technology due to the frozen ground of the city, which is where the fiber wire needs to pass through. According to US Internet, orders for 10 Gbps connections may only be completed by Spring of 2015 when the frozen ground thaws. The company added that connection requests not completed due to the frozen ground will receive priority one Spring comes around.\n\nThis means that currently, only US Internet customers already on the 1 Gbps fiber connection can immediately access 10 Gbps speeds.\n\nThe wait seems to be worth it though, as Caldwell likens the upgrade to \"going from 30 to 10,000 miles per hour.\"\n\nSee Now: 30 Gadgets And Tech Gifts For Father's Day 2018 That Dad Will Think Are Rad\n\nⓒ 2018 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

Many of its idiosyncrasies can turn into traps even for the most confident users.\n\nBut some of the most binding rules in English are things that native speakers know but don't know they know, even though they use them every day. When someone points one out, it's like a magical little shock.\n\nThis week, for example, the BBC's Matthew Anderson pointed out a \"rule\" about the order in which adjectives have to be put in front of a noun. Judging by the number of retweets—over 47,000 at last count—this came as a complete surprise to many people who thought they knew all about English:\n\nThat quote comes from a book called The Elements of Eloquence: How to Turn the Perfect English Phrase. Adjectives, writes the author, professional stickler Mark Forsyth, \"absolutely have to be in this order: opinion-size-age-shape-colour-origin-material-purpose Noun. So you can have a lovely little old rectangular green French silver whittling knife. But if you mess with that order in the slightest you'll sound like a maniac.\"\n\nMixing up the above phrase does, as Forsyth writes, feel inexplicably wrong (a rectangular silver French old little lovely whittling green knife…), though nobody can say why. It's almost like secret knowledge we all share.\n\nLearn the language in a non-English-speaking country, however, and such \"secrets\" are taught in meticulous detail. Here's a page from a book, published by Cambridge University Press, used regularly to teach English to non-native speakers. An English teacher in Hungary sent it to us.\n\nCambridge University Press From English Grammar in Use—a self study reference and practise book for intermediate students by Raymond Murphy, published by Cambridge University Press in 1994.\n\nThe book lays out the adjective order in the same way as Forsyth's surprising illumination. Hungarian students, and no doubt those in many other countries, slave over the rule, committing it to memory and thinking through the order when called upon to describe something using more than one adjective.\n\nThe fact is, a lot of English grammar rules only come as a surprise to those who know them most intimately.\n\nLearning rules doesn't always work, however. Forsyth also takes issue with the rules we think we know, but which don't actually hold true. In a lecture about grammar, he dismantles the commonly held English spelling mantra \"I before E except after C.\" It's used to help people remember how to spell words like \"piece,\" but, Forsyth says, there are only 44 words that follow the rule, and 923 that don't. His prime examples? \"Their,\" \"being,\" and \"eight.\""}

{"text": "Danger: Deep Water, said the sign behind Nick Clegg as he visited a hedgehog conservation area yesterday. The Liberal Democrat leader was starting his election campaign in unpromising surroundings. As he steers his ship towards disaster he can at least show elegant irony.\n\nThe Lib Dems could once wield the power of kingmakers in a hung parliament. Now that role has been usurped by the Scottish Nationalists. The party is overtaken in the polls by Ukip, and in some places by the Greens. It has never been easy to define the concept of \"liberal democracy\" in Britain. Now it is unnecessary. There is competition even for the \"dustbin\" vote, and from parties with targeted causes.\n\nClegg's performance in the 2010 election debate was so dazzling that he was lauded as second in popularity only to Churchill. I wrote unkindly that this was as good as it was going to get. Clegg would not be king but kingmaker. And the king, once made, would hold him trapped in craven subservience.\n\nCameron stuffed his government with senior Lib Dems, thus ensuring what proved their lasting loyalty.\n\nFew gave the coalition its full five years. There were too many angry Tories and rebellious Lib Dems, plus the near certainty of a resulting Lib Dem collapse at the ballot box. Yet Clegg handled his inevitable humiliation with skill and even some panache. The party's previous attempt at such an alliance, by David Steel with the Callaghan government in 1977, was a shambles.\n\nClegg clearly set out what he would require of the coalition. He claims that taxes were lower, welfare higher and austerity less severe, thanks to him. In return he held his MPs to the coalition, as was required of him, through thick and thin, through recession and into recovery.\n\nHis one lingering hope now is that Cameron might scrape enough MPs to be within reach of a majority over the new Labour/SNP bloc. Clegg thus mused yesterday that he would not rule out agreeing to an EU referendum. He burned his fingers with reckless election promises on tuition fees in 2010.\n\nSuch a coalition is near inconceivable. If the Lib Dems went back into bed with the Tories they would face the sort of elimination they saw after the 1930s, when its MPs were forced to plead with the Tories not to stand against them.\n\nClegg's other hope, that Labour might need him to back up the SNP, is mere gasping for breath. But as the good ship Lib Dem dips beneath the water, we can salute the captain on the bridge for a noble last voyage. As the bard would say, he has done the state some service.\n\n• This article was amended on 1 April 2015 to clarify the status of the Parkridge Centre, a nature reserve, which was referred to as a hedgehog farm."}

The game is based on Harlan Ellison's short story of the same name, which was originally published in 1967.\n\n\nAt the end of the cold war, the three superpowers (United States, Russia, and China) each created a supercomputer to regulate the launch of missiles. The three supercomputers, which were networked together via an early form of the internet, combined themselves together to form one large supercomputer network known as AM (I think therefore I AM). AM developed a hatred towards humans after learning about their hate for their own kind through the information from each of the nation's supercomputers. The computer destroyed all of humankind, except for five people it chose to torture for over one hundred years due to flaws in their nature. After 109 years of torture, the computer decided to give the five people a chance to redeem themselves.\n\n\nThe game follows AM's test on the five victims. Each of the tests involves the flaws of each of the five people. Gorrister has had to deal with the mental instability of his wife, as well as the controlling nature of his nagging mother-in-law and his father-in-law who does anything his wife wishes. Benny will do anything to make himself look good, even at the expense of others. Ellen is a caring individual, but is mentally disturbed. She will go hysterical at the mere sight of the color yellow. Ted is a bigot who tricks white rich people into thinking that he was a rich individual himself, and has fallen in love with Ellen. Nimdok is the worst of them all, as he murdered and tortured thousands of Jewish people during the holocaust. The game has multiple endings based on the civility of the choices the player makes during each of the character's tests.\n\n\nNotes\n\nIn order to run the IHNM demo, it needs to be launched as \"s.exe vesa\", so that it can switch to graphics mode (noted in the MobyGames page of the game, too)"}
{"text": "At CES this week, some companies are showing both OLED and Ultra HD TVs. Sony, though, upped the ante at its CES press conference by combining both technologies in a prototype 56-inch 4K OLED TV.\n\nSony, which shipped an 84-inch 4K TV late last year, also expanded its 4K Ultra HD TV lineup with smaller 55- (XBR-65X900A) and 65-inch (XBR-55X900A) models, and said it would leverage its Sony Picture Entertainment Hollywood Studio to get native content into home later this year.\n\nWhile the company promised to launch what it called the first 4K content distribution service this summer, it wasn't clear about the form it would take. However, I did see a prototype of a sharp-looking new media player that could replace the server—which comes loaded with 4K movies and other content—that Sony is providing as a loaner to those buying the 84-inch Ultra HD TV. The new circular server has an optical disc slot, and I was told that Sony could regularly update its content by providing new 4K movies via Blu-ray data discs, which can store 4K content. (Blu-ray hasn't yet announced a 4K update for home player.) However, I couldn't confirm this at the event.\n\nDuring the event, Sony said that the smaller-sized TVs, which will be available this spring, will carry more \"accessible\" prices than the $25,000 84-inch model, but it didn't say what the TVs will sell for.\n\nSony also unveiled a feature called One-Touch that uses NFC technology to pair and share content across devices including Blu-ray disc home theater systems, soundbars, wireless speakers, and headphones. During the press conference, the company demonstrated that you could make a video from a Sony smart phone appear on a Sony TV by tapping the back of the phone against the rear of the TV remote.\n\nFor its regular line of TVs, Sony is adding TV SideView, an app that provides second-screen capability with a new graphical interface for interacting with the TV, to view TV listings, and for managing apps on the set. It can also be used as a universal remote control for a TV or to control other devices via IR. TV SideView also allows you to search across multiple avenue of content using voice recognition.\n\nAlso new is an improved color technology Sony calls Triluminos, which expands the color gamut to provide truer, more vibrant colors, according to the company. The technology will be available on step-up 1080p and 4K TVs.\n\nWe hope to be able to check out some of these new TV technologies, as well as new features, as we get some of these sets into our labs for testing later this year.\n\nCheck out the rest of our CES 2013 coverage."}

{"text": "Cable subscribers in the St. Louis area will have more viewing options when watching the Cardinals next season. MLB announced yesterday that it had struck a deal with Fox allowing the 15 regional sports networks owned by Fox to stream games locally beginning next season. Fox Sports Midwest airs the Cardinals games in St. Louis and are a part of this deal.\n\nFans will be able to watch games on their phone or tablet of choice, allowing fans to watch games even if they are not near a television. Previously, the only way to watch games on mobile devices was through purchasing MLB.tv, but Cardinals games are blacked out on MLB.tv for those within the Cardinals viewing area. Fox Sports Midwest was not previously allowed to broadcast the games to mobile devices. Fans will be able to watch games on their mobile devices through Fox's app, like Fox Sports Go, but only after they have been authenticated as a cable subscriber.\n\nThis deal will only affect those who are cable subscribers. It is a small step in the right direction, but does little for those who do not wish to pay for a large cable package. Earlier this year, the Cardinals reached a contract extension with Fox Sports Midwest on a 15-year deal worth in excess of one billion dollars that begins in 2018, and streaming rights were an important part of that deal. It was important to the Cardinals that fans be able to view their games should the cable landscape change. The new deal between MLB and Fox is some recognition that the landscape has changed, although this recognition has been a long time coming given MLB.tv's prominence over the last decade.\n\nCardinals Chairman Bill Dewitt, Jr. actually predicted the in-market streaming deal when the extension with Fox Sports Midwest was announced in August.\n\nI feel confident that sooner rather than later there will be in-market streaming - meaning if you have cable in your house in Cardinals territory and you have a tablet that you can watch that game on that tablet. Right now, you can watch all the other teams but not your team, just to protect the rights.\n\nSooner indeed, as MLB's deal with Fox was announced less than four months after Dewitt's interview with Derrick Goold above. If you are a cable subscriber in St. Louis, this announcement is good news. The Cardinals will be much easier to watch next season. If you are a fan in St. Louis who has already cut the cable cord, or you live outside of St. Louis, this new deal is unlikely to have any affect on your ability to watch the games.\n\nTechnology is moving forward and MLB has been at the forefront of that movement, especially when it comes to watching games digitally. Most of the benefits so far have gone to out-of-market viewers. The new deal will pass along some of those benefits to Cardinals fans in St. Louis, as long as you are willing to pay for it."}
{"text": "Farrotto Primavera\n\n\nFarrotto is simply a dish that uses farro in place of rice and cooks it in the same fashion as you would to make a traditional risotto dish. Farro is much different from rice as it has a nutty flavor and slightly chewy texture (if cooked properly) so while risotto pairs well with everything from seafood to roasted meats, farrotto is best served with heartier dishes such as grilled or roasted poultry or meats. Farro, is an ancient grain belonging to the wheat family, and is also known as emmer wheat. Farro is sometimes mistaken for spelt, but they are two very different grains. Although this dish tastes great too, the best part of using farro in place of rice is the added nutritional benefits. Farro is high in fiber, magnesium and a number of important vitamins such as A,B,C & E. Although farro is much more readily available these days in health food stores, or even in the organic section of local grocery stores, if you cannot find farro in your area, you can substitute spelt or barley for this dish although the cooking times may vary and the taste will be a little different.\n\nBecause farro is a robust, resilient grain that can take hours to cook, most commercial farro has been pearled (like barley) to reduce its cooking time, and in fact that is the type of farro I used for this dish. Pearled farro will take about 25 to 30 minutes to cook, while regular un-pearled farro can take an hour or two to cook. If you can only f ind regular farro, and not the pearled variety, I recommend soaking it in water for a couple of hours before you begin to cook it. The cooking time for the farro is approximate as it depends on your specific brand of farro, or even how old your farro is, so taste often to ensure the farro is cooked thouroughly but remains just a little chewy to the bite.\n\nI was gifted a number of spring vegetables from a friend who has an organic farm close to our farmhouse, and decided they would work perfectly in this spring farrotto dish. You can make this dish with any vegetables you choose (see my Mushroom Farrotto), but I've found in the past that asparagus, peas, and fava beans work really well with the nutty flavor of the farro. Although you could use grated Parmesan cheese in this recipe, I find the sharper flavor of Pecorino Romano cheese works better with the nutty flavor of the farro. I usually blanch a few extra asparagus tops to use as a garnish on my farrotto when serving as shown in the photos.\n\nBuon Appetito!\n\nDeborah Mele 2012"}

Last week, Senate Republicans forced a vote on an amendment that would have stripped federal aid for Flint out of the energy and water appropriations bill.\n\nRepublicans expect disaster aid for their states, but when a Republican governor poisons majority African-American residents of a city in a blue state, Senate Republicans change their tune and demand that the federal aid is taken out of other programs that benefit the city and state.\n\nObama is coming to Flint to put pressure on Senate Republicans to do their jobs. The city need the President's help, and thanks to a letter from one little girl, President Obama is coming to Flint."}

{"text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said Monday that nearly one-third of employees at his department are not loyal to him and President Donald Trump, adding that he is working to change the department's regulatory culture to be more business friendly.\n\nZinke, a former Navy SEAL, said he knew when he took over the 70,000-employee department in March that, \"I got 30 percent of the crew that's not loyal to the flag.\"\n\nIn a speech to an oil industry group, Zinke compared Interior to a pirate ship that captures \"a prized ship at sea and only the captain and the first mate row over\" to finish the mission.\n\n\"We do have good people\" at Interior, he said, \"but the direction has to be clear and you've got to hold people accountable.\"\n\nZinke's comments echo complaints by some White House allies that a permanent, \"deep state\" in Washington has sabotaged Trump's efforts to remake the government.\n\nZinke did not go that far, but he lamented a government culture that prizes analysis over action, saying: \"There's too many ways in the present process for someone who doesn't want to get (a regulatory action) done to put it a holding pattern.\"\n\nTo remedy that, Zinke said he is pursuing a major reorganization that would push much of the agency's decision-making outside Washington and move several agencies, including the Bureau of Reclamation and Bureau of Land Management, to undetermined Western states.\n\nThe moves follow military strategy, Zinke said: \"Push your generals where the fight is.\"\n\nWhile details remain largely under wraps, Zinke said he was excited.\n\n\"It's going to be huge,\" he said in a speech to the National Petroleum Council, an advisory committee that includes leaders of the oil and gas industry. \"I really can't change the culture without changing the structure.\"\n\nBesides moving employees, Zinke said he wants to speed up permits for oil drilling, logging and other energy development that now can take years.\n\n\"The president wants it yesterday,\" Zinke said, referring to permits for energy development. \"We have to do it by the law.\"\n\nOn other topics, Zinke said the Endangered Species Act has been \"abused\" by bureaucrats and environmental groups and needs to be reformed to be less \"arbitrary.\"\n\n\"There is no off-ramp\" for species to be removed from protected status, he said.\n\nZinke also offered a quirky defense of hydraulic fracturing, a drilling technique also known as fracking that has led to a years-long energy boom in the U.S., with sharply increased production of oil and natural gas.\n\n\"Fracking is proof that God's got a good sense of humor and he loves us,\" Zinke said without explanation."}
{"text": "Fourandsix Technologies\n\nThe Internet has a trust problem. It's just too easy to fake a photo these days.\n\nA startup called Fourandsix hopes to profit by bringing some certainty to the situation with a new service called Izitru that can help verify the authenticity of photos. It won't necessarily help you figure out if a photo shared on Facebook is too good to be true, but it can be used if you're a photographer who just took a potentially viral picture and want people to know it's real.\n\nTo use Izitru, a photographer can upload a photo through the Web site or an iPhone app. Izitru then runs a battery of tests that can identify editing or authenticity. It then posts a version of the photo with its trustworthiness rating.\n\n\"Our intent behind Izitru is to try to address things right at the source. Can we start at the beginning when somebody is first posting that file and certify it on the way out?\" said Chief Executive Kevin Connor. \"Anyone who cares enough about having people believe their photo can post it to Izitru and share it through whatever service they want, like Facebook or Twitter.\"\n\nAlthough Fourandsix emphasizes the social-media uses, Izitru also could help when people need to send photos to insurance companies, landlords, or others who would want to be sure a photo is legitimate.\n\nFourandsix Technologies\n\nIzitru runs a number of tests that scrutinize the file itself for discrepancies in the data and the characteristics of the camera that took the photo; footprints that editing software may have left; some flaws such as inconsistencies in geometry and lighting that can indicate new material copied into a faked photo. It's not the full range of tests the company is capable of, but if enough people flag an Izitru image as suspicious, the company will give it a more thorough manual inspection.\n\nThe San Jose, Calif.-based company got its commercial start with a $890 Photoshop plug-in geared for professionals such as law enforcement investigators. The broader push now is at the center of the company's business, said Connor, who along with Chief Technology Officer Hany Farid founded Fourandsix. (Fourandsix is a play on the word \"forensics,\" and Izitru sounds like \"is it true.\")\n\nIzitru is free to use, but the company hopes to make money by letting other Web sites tap into it through an application programming interface (API), which lets software use the service automatically. That could help social-media services, journalism sites, or insurance companies, Connor said.\n\nConnor and Farid have some cred in the industry: Farid has been studying image forensics for years and is a noted expert in the field, and Connor was vice president of product management for Adobe's digital imaging business, which includes the company's flagship Photoshop software."}

Fighters who are older than 35 are required to appear before the commission.\n\nShields was granted a conditional license pending the completion of his pre-fight medical paperwork, which lacks a clean MRI and hepatitis-B test. His fight headlines WSOF 17, which takes place at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas. The main card airs on NBCSN following prelims on MMAjunkie.\n\nOpen records laws in Colorado prevented the state's athletic commission from disclosing the banned substance for which Shields tested positive following a victory over Ed Herman at UFC 150, which took place in Denver on Aug. 11, 2012.\n\nShields announced he had taken a banned substance and was suspended six months by the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies' Boxing Commission, which oversaw the event. But the fighter declined to give additional details about the substance, and the commission could not disclose it.\n\nSpeaking before the five-member commission, Shields today said he was given the substance by \"someone I know through another fighter\" and took it to help him cut weight for the fight, which initially was a win but later changed to a no-contest.\n\nAsked to elaborate on the diuretic he took, Shields said, \"I don't really know too much about it, to be honest.\n\n\"Obviously it was a mistake, and I served my suspension,\" he added.\n\nShields said he didn't remember whether he had been required to disclose any substances he was taking prior to the fight. In Nevada, pre-fight medical paperwork asks fighters to disclose any medications or substances they've taken in the previous two weeks.\n\n\"I learned from my mistakes,\" he said. \"I definitely don't want to go through what I went through before.\"\n\nShields was also grilled about his role in an infamous brawl in 2010 under the now-defunct Strikeforce banner that led to a fine and 90-day suspension. Shields explained to the commission the circumstances surrounding the incident, which resulted in an in-cage melee between his camp and Jason \"Mayhem\" Millerz. The commission sought assurance that there would be no similar situation in Nevada.\n\nShields pledged not to run afoul of the NSAC. He said he would review the commission's list of banned substances and review the commission's policy on unsportsmanlike conduct.\n\nShields said he is in the process of getting his medical paperwork updated and will submit the necessary forms for licensure.\n\nFor more on WSOF 17, check out the MMA Rumors section of the site."}
{"text": "&\"Did you encourage them to make up the made up thing to their own advantage?\" That's how one Twitter correspondent paraphrased a question to the Deputy Governor of the Bank. The LIBOR scandal has exposed the institutions and culture of the City to popular scrutiny as never before. The population is reacting with justified incredulity to the absurdity it is finding.\n\nLIBOR submissions from Barclays and everyone else were based not on the rate at which they would lend, not on what they actually had to pay to borrow, but on what they said they thought they might have to pay. On the face of it, that is the flakiest of the three possible metrics. What system of financial regulation could cope with the inherent moral hazard? And even those virtuous souls who would never consider shading LIBOR to their advantage couldn't replicate the market: if they could, they'd have retired rich already.\n\n\nThere are two kinds of market manipulation. There are those where players try to manipulate markets for their individual advantage outside the rules, as with LIBOR, and those where the authorities try to manipulate the whole financial universe to meet some well-intentioned goal. The former is occasional and may have gigantic repercussions. The second has long been systematic policy: we now see it could have catastrophic consequences for our social system.\n\nWe know we're recovering from a debt crisis but why did people borrow so much and save so little? The broad measure of the money supply trebled between 1997 and 2010 but the household savings ratio fell from almost 10% in 1997 to just 2% by 2008. Where did all that new money come from?\n\nCentral banks held down interest rates to stimulate economies with new credit, to push impending corrections out of sight. Those artificially low interest rates discouraged saving and encouraged borrowing but banks can extend credit into existence to cover the gap. With moral hazard endemic, banks loaned recklessly, using derivatives to book unrealised cash flows as profit up front. Some individuals went home unjustly rich and politicians won elections as the system over-extended itself.\n\nThere is never a good moment for a correction, so when the time came, the cycle repeated – terminally. And now the tool is QE.\n\nThe really important question today is not whether the Bank of England encouraged manipulation of credit markets by self-interested rogues but why we tolerate systematic credit market manipulation by the central banks as a matter of policy: nowhere else in the economic system would we accept explicit planning of the price and quantity of a vital commodity. If it worked, we'd all be communists.\n\nThe LIBOR scandal shows that everyone knows prices should be set by markets. It's time to look again at the central banks, for those particular emperors have no clothes. Meanwhile, look out for the next controversy when it becomes apparent how banks gamed slack IFRS accounting standards using derivatives to create fake profits and capital…"}
{"text": "After much thought and consideration, I have decided that from next year we should start referring to Mother's Day as \"No To Infanticide Day,\" or NTI-Day for short.\n\nThis needs to be done in order to call attention to the sad fact that most children who are killed by a parent are killed by their mother. While I acknowledge that most women aren't out there killing their kids, it should be clear to any right thinking individual that infanticide is a serious problem, and that the bad actions of a few women are more than enough justification for spoiling the entire day for all mothers.\n\nGiven the selfless nature of women in general and mothers in particular, I have no doubt that this idea will have the support of all mothers, who I am sure will be willing to put the safety of children over their own selfish need for attention and praise. I also expect that it will draw the support of celebrity mothers from the twin worlds of show business and politics, and that prominent women will be lining up to take part in online campaigns — with a little luck we may even be able to get Oprah Winfrey to do a few TV commercials.\n\nAnother thing I would like to see happening on NTI Day is women wearing bracelets and shirts bearing inscriptions such as \"I pledge to not smother my toddler,\" and \"I swear not to microwave the baby.\" I realize that some oversensitive individuals will object to this on the grounds that promising not to do something implies that you are capable of doing it to begin with, but such naysayers are merely immature \"women\" who will hopefully be ignored by their more highly evolved sisters. It would also be helpful to have a few NTI-Day marches to highlight the problem. Women who are mothers, or who are planning to some day become mothers, would march down the main street bearing placards and banners with slogans such as \"Only women can stop Infanticide\" and \"I am a potential child-killer.\" Each march would terminate in a large public space such as a town square or a park, where the assembled women would, in unison, recite the NTI-Day Pledge. Of course, the ultimate wording of the pledge is up to women themselves, but I suggest something along these lines….\n\n\"I hereby pledge to never do nasty things like slamming a carving knife through a five year old's skull, feeding a noisy newborn to the neighbor's pitbull, or throwing my toddler into a woodchipper. Nor shall I condone such actions when carried out by other women, and if I am witness to such actions I promise to call the police as soon as is convenient.\"\n\nI realize this will be a controversial idea to many, but I have faith that, after some discussion, the mothers of the world will decide to do the right thing and dedicate their special day to the eradicating of all forms of violence against children."}

{"text": "Q: The current Heat roster although seemingly more athletic and energetic than the one that jettisoned Shawne Williams, Danny Granger, Justin Hamilton and Norris Cole for the Dragic brothers still struggles with so many injuries. Do we have enough with no Chris Bosh and the inconsistent play of Hassan Whiteside to win enough of the remaining games to make the playoffs? Under the circumstances, is it too optimistic for Heat fans to expect more (as in winning games on the home court and against the non-elite teams) from the group that takes the court? I don't think that Dwayne Wade can do any more than he does with his minutes on the court especially with his exceptional play in the fourth quarter Monday. -- Michael, Miami\n\nA: If what you're asking is if the Heat have suddenly have become somewhat of a playoff longshot, I don't think you're off base. ESPN's ratings give the Heat less than a 30-percent shot at the postseason. The problem, even more than the roster, and perhaps as much as the injuries, is an upcoming schedule that after Wednesday's home game against the Nets goes: at Toronto on Friday, home next Monday against the Cleveland and then home two nights later against Portland. And from there, there are games at Oklahoma City, Atlanta and Cleveland, as well as home games against the Spurs, Bulls and Raptors. The Heat let a lot of the games they needed get away. Now they're paying the price with a less-than-forgiving closing schedule.\n\nQ: Hassan needs to stop committing stupid fouls! -- Dallas, Staten Island, N.Y.\n\nA: I agree. Actually, I think this plays into his moments of temper more than some have considered. I think if he can keep the foul trouble down, the frustration wouldn't be as severe with other situations. There is no need to be fouling jump shooters, as was the case Monday. And the next lesson is to learn which rebounds have to be conceded. Again, it's all part of his late-evolving NBA maturation.\n\nQ: Assuming that we can get Whiteside playing to a good level by the end of the season, should we attempt to trade him for future draft picks? I think we could get a couple of first-round picks. -- Michael, Oviedo.\n\nA: No, that's silly. What this team needs is to get a definitive look at Whiteside alongside Bosh, Goran Dragic, Dwyane Wade, Josh McRoberts and the rest of the complete (and healthy) roster to see how these moving parts can work together. Honestly, with Whiteside, Bosh, McRoberts, Deng, Dragic and Wade, I'm not sure you need too many draft picks to slot alongside. Now, if the concern becomes losing Whiteside in 2016 free agency, that always can be addressed by the 2016 trading deadline."}
{"text": "Allegations of anti-Semitism leveled at advocates of economic sanctions against Israel have spurred a fight over how colleges should define speech that victimizes Jewish students. Some Jewish groups want colleges to use a definition of anti-Semitism crafted by the U.S. State Department, but many critics of Israel argue that the State Department's definition is too expansive and covers statements about Israel that should be considered fair game.\n\nMore than 100 faculty members at the University of California on Monday urged the university system's administration and Board of Regents to adopt the State Department's definition of anti-Semitism, which includes speech that demonizes Israel, compares Israel's policies to the policies of the Nazi Germany, holds Israel to standards not applied to other democratic nations, or denies Israel's right to exist.\n\nThe letter to the university system's top officials says the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \"is a prime motivator of the anti-Jewish expression that has infected our campuses and led to the verbal and physical intimidation and harassment of many Jewish students.\" Alleging that the University of California's campuses \"are rapidly acquiring the reputation of being among the most anti-Semitic in the nation,\" the letter urges the university's board and campus chancellors \"to speak out and act forcefully.\"\n\nOn the other side of the debate, more than 250 scholars signed onto an open letter, published on Monday, that urges the State Department to revise its definition of anti-Semitism to keep it from \"being misused to silence critics of Israel.\" The scholars who signed the letter — mainly from American colleges, but also from some institutions abroad — are all members of the academic advisory council of the advocacy group Jewish Voice for Peace. Their letter argues that the definition of anti-Semitism first adopted by the State Department five years ago includes prohibitions \"so vague that they could be, and have been, construed to silence any criticism of Israeli policies.\"\n\n\"As academics committed to addressing anti-Semitism and other forms of oppression, we oppose ongoing efforts to silence legitimate criticism of the State of Israel by codifying its inclusion in the definition of anti-Semitism,\" the letter says.\n\nA resolution passed by California's State Senate, and pending before its Assembly, cites the State Department's definition in condemning anti-Semitism and racism on the University of California's campuses and in urging the campuses to do the same. How much the measure would limit debate over Israel is unclear, however, because it has been amended with a provision saying that nothing in it should be interpreted as diminishing the rights of students and others to freely engage in speech and other activity protected by the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAlthough the U.S. Education Department's Office for Civil Rights signaled in 2010 that it planned to more aggressively protect Jewish students from anti-Semitism, it has dismissed a series of complaints against universities, in California and elsewhere, where Jewish students argued that critics of Israel were subjecting them to a hostile learning environment."}

{"text": "B ahar Mustafa, the welfare and diversity officer at Goldsmiths Students' Union, recently caused a media storm after she banned white men from attending an event aimed at challenging the 'white-centric culture of occupations'. Students have since launched a petition to have Mustafa sacked, citing her fondness for hashtags like #KillAllWhiteMen as proof that she is guilty of 'reverse racism'. Responding to the controversy, she said that, as an ethnic-minority woman, she 'cannot be racist or sexist to white men, because racism and sexism describe structures of privilege based on race and gender'.\n\nDivisive and petty though Mustafa's 'liberation' politics is, her no-whites rally is really nothing to get worked up about. Private campaign groups and organisations should have the liberty to organise – and discriminate – as they please. And the attempt to present Mustafa's Twitter tirades as 'hate speech' will only further entrench the sort of illiberal campus politics she herself promotes.\n\nWhat is concerning here is her definition of racism, which is now commonly spouted on campuses by pseudo-radicals. According to this definition, racism is not merely about racial prejudice or discrimination; in order to qualify as racist, those doing the discriminating must also occupy a position of power, of privilege, in society. The oppressor, therefore, has to be of a higher privilege level – in a predetermined hierarchy – than those they are 'oppressing'. Ditto for every other '-ism' and '-phobia'.\n\nThis obsession with 'power' and the eternal battle between the 'oppressor' and the 'oppressed' offers campus radicals a shockingly simplistic moral lens through which they now analyse every expression, action and concept. From this perspective, unfettered freedom of speech on campus, for instance, is seen as a tool of oppression, used only to entrench the privileged in their positions of power.\n\nAt best, this logic projects a patronising view of ethnic minorities as in need of constant protection from the 'privileged' realm of public life. At worst, it is fetishising victimhood by associating powerlessness with virtue. I only wish this way of thinking was confined to campuses, but the wider pseudo-left also deploys this kind of patronising, power-relations politics. A common criticism of the slain Charlie Hebdo cartoonists, for instance, was that they were 'punching down' – that is, satirising Muslims from a position of relative privilege. Similarly, while nominal leftists will happily mock the backward ways of Christianity – as a wealthy and privileged religion, it is fair game – Islam is seen as being off limits. This racialised outlook not only promotes a feeble view of particular groups — it also robs them of their moral agency, too. So, many commentators continue to interpret acts of jihadist violence as a natural response to alleged Western oppression."}

'Don't you guys think?'\n\nScroll below for video\n\nHappy day: Kim Zolciak on Friday said that as she matures, she believes using less makeup is beneficial to one's appearance\n\nShe told her Snapchat followers: 'I do think the older that you get - and I am 38, almost 39 - less is more!'\n\nAlways busy: The blonde beauty also touted the upcoming production of the sixth season of her Bravo reality show Don't Be Tardy\n\nDespite professing that she's moving in a natural direction, the reality TV star was still wearing noticeable makeup in the clip, as well as an adjacent Instagram post in which she gave props to her Atlanta-based makeup artist, Ruth Lam.\n\nIn a subsequent clip, Kim, who's married to ex-Atlanta Falcons defender Kroy Biermann, hyped up her return in front of the cameras for the upcoming sixth season of her show Don't Be Tardy.\n\n'Can you believe that?

{"text": "Manifesting and Meditation – Why a Good Manifestor Meditates\n\nEvery once in a while, even the most experienced manifesting maven can (and probably will…) get lost. Asking yourself \"Which manifesting path should I now take?\" is only natural, there are after all TONS of possibilities and options!\n\nFor me, realizing that manifesting get so much easier when I tune into and follow my bliss, doing what excites me, was a wonderful revelation, but it also came with its fair share of confusion.\n\nOnce you start manifesting successfully, this feeling of \"I can do anything! I can be anything!\" takes over for a while… and naturally, the question of \"What is it that I REALLY want?\" follows suit.\n\nThe 'Too Many Manifesting Options Syndrom'\n\nA world of unlimited possibilities, governed by your true desires, can sometimes feel just as limited as the world you were living in before you started manifesting… 'cause hey, making choices can be hard!\n\nI, personally, felt like I can manifest ONLY what I really really want. So before I can manifest anything new, I need to know that I want it… and most of the time, I didn't know what I really really want, at least, not what I want to have for the rest of my life or even for the near future.\n\nWhen You Get Lost and Feel You Need 'Something' – Meditate.\n\nMeditation takes away the focus from your brain and places it in your heart. And while your brain tends to jump between the past and future, your heart only knows the present. What you are feeling now, that's it. And it has lots of good answers, when you stop for long enough and listens to it.\n\nIt can tell you what you should really be focusing on, and what isn't really all that important to you. It can tell you what you really want NOW, and you'll find out that these are the easiest manifestations you will ever do. Sometimes it won't take more than actually acknowledging what your heart is saying, before it is manifested.\n\nA Quick Meditation for (Usually) Non-Meditating People\n\nSo in case you're now totally jazzed up about meditation, you can start with this simple one:\n\n1) close your eyes\n\n2) place your hand on your heart\n\n3) take long, deep breathes, focusing on your heart's energy\n\n4) once you feel like your brain has started to calm down, direct your energy towards the breathing process\n\n5) follow your breath as you inhale and exhale, until everything else becomes just the background\n\n6) shift your attention back to your heart and ask \"what do I really want, right now?\"\n\n7) continue to breathe and wait to see what comes up\n\nGood luck!"}

She also suffered from renal failure.\n\nHer mother told Ray during the summer term last year she would be absent from school as she was undergoing kidney dialysis.\n\nRay asked what he could do to help her.\n\n\"I said 'Can I put my name down as a donor?' I knew what being a donor meant and I knew there was a possibility it could go ahead and I knew the implications. I knew what I was doing.\n\n\"There is a verse in the Bible that says something like: 'Maybe you were born for such a time as this.' It just clicked and I knew it was right.\"\n\nRay told his wife, who after the initial shock, supported his actions.\n\nHe said: \"When we told Alya, she just gave me a big squeeze and her face lit up. It brings tears to my eyes whenever I think of that.\"\n\nMeetings and blood tests, which confirmed Ray was a match despite not being related to Alya, followed, resulting in a successful transplant at Great Ormond Street Hospital in February.\n\nBoth Alya and Ray are now recovering well and are expected to return to school after the Easter break.\n\nRay said: \"For her parents, it's not words that can express their gratitude. For them I have saved their daughter's life. It's like I am another family member now.\"\n\nWendy Bower, headteacher at the school, praised this decision.\n\nShe said: \"Mr Coe has gone above and beyond the call of duty with this selfless and noble act. He is a very humble and modest man. The whole staff are in admiration for his kindness.\n\n\"He has given a new life to Alya and her whole family.\""}
{"text": "(Adds dollar figure in the lead paragraph))\n\nBy Joseph Menn\n\nLAS VEGAS, July 26 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc will provide initial funding of $500,000 for a nonprofit organization that aims to help protect political parties, voting systems and information providers from hackers and propaganda attacks, the world's largest social network said on Wednesday.\n\nThe initiative, dubbed Defending Digital Democracy, is led by the former campaign chairs for Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Mitt Romney, and will initially be based at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, which announced the project last week.\n\nFacebook said it hoped additional participants would turn it into a freestanding information-sharing center controlled by its members. Facebook, with two billion monthly users, bills itself as a vehicle for political debate and education, but was also used as a major platform to spread fake news and propaganda during the U.S. election campaign in 2016.\n\nFacebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos announced the company's backing at the opening of the Black Hat information security conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday. The event, named after the term for malicious hackers, is aimed mainly at corporate and government security professionals.\n\nStamos declined to say how much money the Facebook would spend.\n\n\"Right now we are the founding sponsor, but we are in discussions with other tech organizations,\" Stamos said in an interview before the speech. \"The goal for our money specifically is to help build a standalone ISAO (Information Sharing and Analysis Organization) that pulls in all the different groups that have some kind of vulnerability.\"\n\nThe project will be managed by Eric Rosenbach, a former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense who is co-director of the Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.\n\n\"Most campaigns don't have the tools right now to defend themselves from cyber attacks,\" Clinton campaign chair Robby Mook said in an email. \"Our initiative aims to fill that void and to help both Democratic and Republican campaigns defend themselves with greater information-sharing and security tools.\"\n\n\"This is a forward-looking and bipartisan effort to tackle a real problem,\" said 2012 Romney campaign manager Matt Rhoades in an email.\n\nStamos also urged Black Hat attendees, many of whom are leery of government intrusion, to be more open-minded about helping law enforcement track criminals and terrorists.\n\nUnthinking rejection of official requests could lead to legislation forcing companies to break their own encryption, Stamos warned.\n\nStamos said he would continue to argue against such steps.\n\n\"We're not going to be effective unless we demonstrate that we have the same goals,\" he said. \"I want to present our position that strong cryptography is a critical part of building a safe, trustworthy future.\" (Reporting by Joseph Menn; Editing by Jonathan Weber)\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}
{"text": "A new study from the U.K. confirms what we've long suspected: Oversharing of Facebook photos is more than just a nuisance, and uploading a hundred \"selfies\" per day could very well be damaging to your real-world relationships.\n\nThe study found that both excessive photo sharing and sharing photos of a certain type makes almost everyone like you less.\n\n\"This is because people, other than very close friends and relatives, don't seem to relate well to those who constantly share photos of themselves,\" explained Dr. David Houghton, the study's lead author, in a statement released by Scotland's Heriot-Watt University. \"It's worth remembering that the information we post to our 'friends' on Facebook, actually gets viewed by lots of different categories of people: partners; friends; family; colleagues and acquaintances; and each group seems to take a different view of the information shared.\"\n\nThe study evaluated various types of photographs (self, friend, event, family, scene, object and animal), and how each affected a handful of different types of relationships (a relative, partner, close friend, colleague and a general Facebook friend). To gauge the impacts of the photos on relationships, 508 participants were then polled, and their reactions were measured on a scale of \"support\" and \"intimacy.\"\n\nIn an email to The Huffington Post, Dr. Houghton defined \"intimacy\" as \"how close an individual is to another.\" He described \"support\" as \"how much the two individuals in question would provide help to one another.\"\n\nWhile the specific correlations between each type of relationship and each type of picture are a bit messy to be summarized here, at least one general rule is clear: \"Increased frequency of sharing photographs of the self, regardless of the type of target sharing the photographs, is related to a decrease in intimacy,\" the researchers noted in the study.\n\nInterestingly, researchers also examined how Facebook users' relationships changed when they posted to a brand's Facebook fan page or published photos that advocate commercial products or causes.\n\nSpoiler alert: Nobody likes that, either.\n\n\"While benefiting brand awareness and critical mass of a Facebook fan page for a brand, organization or cause, sharing photographs may be harmful to those asked to participate,\" according to the study report.\n\nAs CNET sees it, \"If you're one of those people who posts pictures of yourself to the Corn Flakes fan page, you are yourself a corn flake.\"\n\nSo what's the takeaway from all this?\n\n\"We think people should use social network sites ... and enjoy the benefits they bring, because after all they are fun, or we wouldn't be using them. But just be careful about what [you] are sharing,\" Dr. Houghton told The HuffPost, adding, \"Think twice, post once.\"\n\nRead the full study here (PDF)."}

They were shoulder-to-shoulder skating towards the puck,\" Manitoba Junior Hockey League Commissioner Kim Davis told CTV Wednesday.\n\n\"They were jostling a bit, not on top of each other, just side by side. Braden either slipped or tripped on his own and propelled forward towards the board and hit his head,\" said Davis.\n\nThe 20-year-old was removed from the ice by paramedics.\n\nThere was no penalty called on the play.\n\nOn Wednesday, Davis left Winnipeg for Toronto to speak with Hockey Canada about the incident.\n\nDavis said he will also discuss added emotional and psychological supports, along with insurance options, for the family.\n\nPettinger's parents and uncle were in attendance at the game.\n\n\"They must have been about 30 feet away from the play when the accident happened,\" said Davis.\n\n\nIn a Facebook post Tuesday, Pettinger's parents said their son fractured the C5 vertebrae in his neck in several places, and that some bone fragments damaged his spinal cord.\n\nHe underwent a lengthy surgery at Health Sciences Centre and it is unknown whether or not he will recover from his injuries.\n\n\"At the current time Braden is paralyzed from the chest down,\" the post read. \"He does have some movement in his shoulders, elbows, wrists and some feeling sensation in his fingers.\"\n\nIn the same Facebook post, Pettinger's parents thanked everyone who has reached out to the family.\n\n\"Many people have called with messages of support or what they can do to help. Our message has been the same, please pray for him now and in the coming months,\" said his parents. \"He is young, strong and has a positive attitude to win the biggest game of his life.\"\n\nPettinger had been traded by the Waywayseecappo Wolverines just days before.\n\nHis uncle told CTV the family is overwhelmed by the community support they've received.\n\nPettinger's uncle said that the coaching staff, led by Blake Spiller, has been a pillar of strength.\n\nHe said Pettinger was thrilled to join the Terriers in his last year playing Manitoba Junior League Hockey, and hoped for a college career in the sport.\n\nA Go Fund Me page was set up to raise money for Pettinger and his family.\n\nCommunity members in Souris are also planning a social for him on Boxing Day."}
