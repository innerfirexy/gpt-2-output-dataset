{"text": "As daylight hours grow short in the northern hemisphere, a few hardy mountain bikers are digging their bike lights out of their closet and are preparing to hit the trail after dark. But for many riders, night riding is an intimidating prospect or an option that might not have crossed their minds.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with night riding, here are my top 10 reasons to ride mountain bike trails at night:\n\n1. Riding in the dark makes you a better rider. At night your field of vision narrows to the thin strip of dirt just in front of your tire, which allows you to concentrate on reading the trail in new ways. Shadows cover hidden obstacles so you'll quickly learn to be more alert and to react more quickly to the terrain. As a part of a broader skills training regimen, night riding will hone your abilities on the trail.\n\n2. Old trails become new. If you're like me, sometimes you get bored of riding the same old trails week after week but night riding changes things completely. Riding through a dark tunnel of trees and blackness will get your adrenaline pumping, while things like trail exposure will fade away, making difficult trails seem easier and vice versa.\n\n3. Dark trails are empty trails. If you're looking for solitude on the trail but don't want to drive to the middle of nowhere, night riding can be just the ticket to getting the trails all to yourself. The upshot is you can also ride faster without worrying about running into riders heading the opposite direction. Even if you do encounter other riders you'll be able to see their lights well before they approach.\n\n4. Lower temps in the summer. This one bites both ways, but I love being able to ride at night during the summer when the temperatures are much lower than during the day. Even better: a pre-dawn ride in the summertime.\n\n5. Open up your riding schedule. If you have a family, you know that getting in a little trail time can be a challenge some days. Riding at night is a good compromise since it opens up your schedule to do other things during the day. Who needs sleep anyway?\n\n6. Good excuse to get new gear. I know, I know, mountain biking isn't all about the gear but sometimes it's fun to play with new toys. For night riding, you'll need at least one high tech light system and warmer clothing if you're riding during the winter.\n\n7. Night riding is more social. Riding at night by yourself is even more dangerous than riding solo during the day, though that's not to say I haven't done it more than once. Still, thanks to #5 most of your riding buddies won't have an excuse for skipping a night ride. After our Tuesday night rides we usually go out for pizza and beer, which is almost as fun as riding.\n\n8. Avoid trail user conflicts. I've never heard of anyone going \"night hiking,\" though I suppose some people do it. Still, you typically won't find hikers or equestrians out on the trails at night, which opens up the riding possibilities.\n\n9. See the light show. Just because it's nighttime doesn't mean you won't be able to see amazing scenery. If you've ever seen a stream of a dozen bike lights weaving through the forest at night, you know what I'm talking about — such a cool sight.\n\n10. Extend your season. If you're used to hitting the trail for a couple hours after work, standard time can put a crimp in your plans — unless of course, you have a light. Don't be a caveman — get a light and venture out at night!\n\nWhat do you like (or dislike) about riding at night?\n\nConvinced you're ready for your first night ride?

{"text": "Can you drive snow and winter tires year round? It's an idea that occurs to many drivers who experience winter weather: If I have to mount snow tires every year, why don't I just keep them on my vehicle all the time?\n\nUnfortunately, using snow tires year round isn't recommended. In the long run, it will cost more money than changing them out and could compromise your vehicle's performance on the road. That's why tire makers offer different types of tires for different seasons – the best option for you is determined by many factors including climate, driving style, and performance needs.\n\nHere are some specific reasons why year-round use of winter tires is not advised. And if it's the hassle of tire mounting, unmounting, and remounting that you're tired of, we've included an idea for simplifying that process, too.\n\nFirst, what is a Winter Tire?\n\nAll winter tires, whether studless or studded, are made to maintain better traction in extreme cold, and on icy, snowy, or slushy roads. The rubber is able to remain softer, which makes it more flexible, allowing the tire to conform to the road better in extremely cold conditions. This feature, along with deeper tread depths and specialized tread designs, are what make snow/winter tires ideal for inclement winter weather and extreme cold driving conditions.\n\nWe use this analogy - tennis shoes. Yes, you can wear tennis shoes on the beach or in the snow, but wouldn't it be better to have flip flops on the beach and boots for the snow? Winter tires are like snow boots for your car.\n\nWhy You Shouldn't Use Winter Tires Year-Round\n\nWinter tires are specially designed for cold temperatures and winter precipitation. Once it gets warm, you won't need deep tread depths to handle snow or biting edges for traction on ice. Here are some specific reasons why using winter tires year round is not recommended.\n\nFaster wear on warm, dry pavement - the tread rubber of winter tires is considerably more flexible than that of all season and summer tires. That same pliable tread rubber that adds traction in winter will wear down quickly in warm temperatures. Summer and all-season tires are built to withstand warm temperatures, providing long wear life.\n\nDecreased performance - In warm weather, winter tires won't provide the same handling capabilities as summer or all-season tires. Imagine if you needed to make a quick maneuver and your tires were soft and squishy. You won't get the crisp response from a winter tire in warm weather. Winter tires need that flexibilitity to handle ice and snow, but it's not as useful in warm weather.\n\nThe specialized compounds and tread designs of winter tires are not designed for optimal warm climate performance and wear. Generally speaking, the softer tread of a winter tire will wear out faster in warmer temperatures. If you keep winter tires on your vehicle after winter has come and gone, you will have to replace them sooner than had you removed them for springtime.\n\nThat's why using snow tires year round is more expensive than mounting them seasonally. The sooner they wear out, the sooner you have to replace them.\n\nSimplify Tire Re-Mounting\n\nDriving on snow tires year-round could compromise optimal tread wear and ultimately be more expensive than just changing tires out for the season.\n\nIf you were considering year-round use of winter tires because you were tired of having to change them, here's an idea that could save you time and money. Purchase wheels with the same diameter and bolt pattern as your current wheels. Mount your snow tires on those and store them in the garage until winter arrives.\n\nInstead of having to change out your tires each season, just have a technician change the wheels. It's a quick, relatively inexpensive alternative to mounting and unmounting snow tires every season."}
{"text": "For those liberals who fear what a Donald Trump presidency will look like, Thursday brought no comfort—only horrifying confirmation. According to The Hill, Trump's administration is preparing to slash basically every program Democrats covet from the budget—including, but not limited to, energy-efficiency programs, initiatives geared toward preventing domestic violence, and civil rights programs. Also on the chopping block? The National Endowment for the Arts (N.E.A.) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (N.E.H.) would be eliminated entirely, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (C.P.B.)—which, in part, funds PBS—would be privatized.\n\nMind you, the cuts for the arts would do almost nothing to fix the budget deficit: according to Deadline, the total cost for the N.E.A., N.E.H., and C.P.B.—$741 million—make up a measly .016 percent of the total U.S. budget which is ($4.6 trillion). Sure, every dollar counts when you're trying to save a few bucks—but given how untenable Trump's savings goals appear to be, these proposed cuts feel more like a vindictive slap in the face to liberals than effective budget measures. The bright side? As The Hill notes, \"The budget offices of the various departments will have the chance to review the proposals, offer feedback and appeal for changes before the president's budget goes to Congress.\" Ultimately, it'll be up to Congress whether these cuts happen or not.\n\nIf the arts funding cuts—particularly the proposed privatization of the C.P.B.—sound familiar, it might be because Mitt Romney found himself in hot water for proposing something similar just a few years ago. Remember the presidential debate in which Big Bird improbably became the star of the show? That happened because Romney proposed cutting off taxpayer money to PBS—which, at the time, was home to Sesame Street and its beloved yellow fowl. Now, of course, Big Bird and the gang have flown the coop to HBO in their own controversial maneuver—leaving the arts and humanities without as compelling a mascot for votes to rally behind as Trump and the G.O.P. stand over the federal budget, axes ready.\n\nBefore Trump, there was another president who tried to cut funding to the C.P.B.: Richard Nixon. Back when Nixon threatened to slice the C.P.B.'s budget in half—prompting Fred Rogers to mount a stirring defense of what he and others were doing with their meager budgets. (It worked.) And the endowments have faced threats from the G.O.P. before, too—from Ronald Reagan, whom Deadline notes wanted to eliminate the N.E.A. entirely, though he ended up cutting its budget down to half its original size instead.\n\nThis issue is about much more than PBS—as worthy of protection as that organization is. With these cuts and budget shifts, NPR—also funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting—is equally imperiled. As the Huffington Post notes, \"The NEH has supported the creation of 16 Pulitzer Prize-winning books and Ken Burns's iconic documentary The Civil War.\" And if cultural value isn't something the G.O.P. is willing to consider worthy of taxpayer dollars, it's also worth pointing out—as Huffington Post does—that the N.E.A. helped get the fledgling Sundance Film Festival started. If you want to talk about millions of dollars worth of economic stimulation, check out last year's sales, which included awards darling Manchester by the Sea.\n\nConsidering how little Trump's arts cuts would save, it's hard to imagine they would make up for what they would cost us.\n\nGet Vanity Fair's HWD Newsletter Sign up for essential industry and award news from Hollywood.

{"text": "A new report by The Intercept details a stunning heist made by US and UK spies that has given intelligence agencies the ability to break through the privacy of smartphone communications. The report claims that the NSA and GCHQ successfully hacked the network of Gemalto, a major manufacturer of SIM cards, and obtained the secret keys that unlock phone data. In short, it's a massive security breach that means your phone could be vulnerable to the whims of the world's most powerful spy agencies.\n\nWe still don't know how many people may be affected, but it's safe to say that the number could be significant; all four major US carriers are customers of Gemalto, and The Intercept reports that the company produces around 2 billion SIM cards each year. We have asked the big carriers — AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint — to comment on the story. Gemalto says it can not verify the findings, and had no prior knowledge that the agencies were conducting the operation. It is currently investigating the claims.\n\nThe breach is disastrous for mobile security\n\nThe breach is disastrous for mobile security, which has historically already been on shaky ground. \"Gaining access to a database of keys is pretty much game over for cellular encryption,\" cryptography specialist Matthew Green told The Intercept.\n\nToday's report potentially fills some gaps in what we know about how the NSA collects data over the internet. The agency has two main sources of data: \"downstream\" collection, which involves explicit requests to technology companies for user data, and \"upstream\" collection, which pulls data directly from the cables and airwaves that facilitate the internet. The NSA is sophisticated in both methods, but one big outstanding question has been just how effective the agency's upstream collection is. It's simply too expensive to decrypt massive amounts of data with brute force — but it's a different story if you possess the encryption keys for, say, a secure email client. Or billions of mobile SIM cards.\n\n\"GCHQ cyberstalked Gemalto employees\"\n\nSo how did spies get their hands on the goods? As The Intercept describes it, it was a real caper. The report describes how GCHQ spies targeted individual employees in major telecom corporations and SIM card manufacturers, accessing their email and Facebook accounts. \"In effect, GCHQ clandestinely cyberstalked Gemalto employees,\" The Intercept writes — scooping up whatever breadcrumbs they could find that would lead them back to Gemalto's systems. In one instance, the report claims, the GCHQ suspiciously targeted a Gemalto employee in Thailand because he was using PGP to encrypt data. But it also appears that some of the companies involved in SIM production didn't take strong measures to protect sensitive data; the report says that \"many\" SIM card manufacturers sent keys with weak or no encryption.\n\nThe attempt to break into a major corporation to steal private encryption keys that protect millions of people around the world is certainly brazen, but it's not surprising behavior. Part of what we've learned in the past two years is that the NSA and its allies go to great lengths to collect data, to break or interfere with security on the internet, and to embarrass their adversaries.\n\nThe SIM heist is the latest revelation to come from the efforts of Edward Snowden. Snowden, a former NSA contractor, started a worldwide conversation about boundless government surveillance when he leaked a trove of top secret files to journalists in 2013. The first of the stories that resulted from the leak came on June 5th, 2013, when The Guardian reported that the NSA had been collecting the phone records of millions of Verizon customers on a daily basis. Since then, the public has learned about dozens of surveillance programs and secret plots that critics say have undermined the security and privacy of the internet for everyone who uses it.\n\nUpdate Feb 20th, 10:16 am: Article updated with statement from Gemalto."}

{"text": "The New York Red Bulls are known to be in the market for an attacking player - and, not so long ago, head coach Jesse Marsch told MSG's Kristian Dyer the team was hoping to land a \"difference-maker\".\n\nThat difference-maker isn't going to be ex-Nice and France U-20 player Alexy Bosetti, according to Alexy Bosetti (and implied by Marsch in his comments to Dyer in the same interview in which he described RBNY's current transfer market priorities).\n\nNor is it going to be Juan Fernando Quintero. Reporting for Metro (no relation), Kristian Dyer advises \"a league source\" states RBNY is not in the hunt to sign the Colombian play-maker.\n\nThe notion that Quintero has MLS suitors has been around for a while. And the New York Red Bulls had their name thrown into the mix at least a couple of weeks ago - though at the time it seemed more inconsequential speculation than anything else.\n\n@Once_A_Metro bad bad rumor. \"Quintero has offers from MLS and one team is New York Red Bulls.\" No details, their source is Euro outlets https://t.co/NshijhcOkV — Señor Soccer (@JuanMapu) May 31, 2017\n\nBut the Quintero-to-MLS story will not die.\n\nHearing from sources that Colombian international Juan Quintero has interest from several MLS clubs.No move imminent; interest is \"strong.\" — Kristian Dyer (@KristianRDyer) June 8, 2017\n\nAnd the rumor mill did not seem inclined to separate RBNY from the whispering campaign either.\n\nOrlando City y New York Red Bulls de Estados Unidos interesados en Juan Fernando Quintero (Independiente Medellin) pic.twitter.com/P6w1caiFAq — Fichajes Del FPC (@FichajesFPC2017) June 15, 2017\n\nIt should be noted that Quintero-to-somewhere has been a rumor-mill staple for a while. In late April, it was suggested Sevilla was keen to sign him. By the end of May, it was reported that Sevilla had competition from clubs in Russia and the USA. There was also suggestion Sevilla did not agree with Quintero's current club - Porto - that the player was worth around $11.2 million.\n\nThat valuation has since dropped, with some reports suggesting Porto might be amenable to halving the rumored fee to offload the midfielder. Orlando City - known to have a taste for high-profile, expensive signings - has been mentioned in the latest rumors, and unspecified interest from the UAE has recently supplanted Russia in the stories surrounding Quintero's future.\n\nRBNY was mentioned by Portuguese outlet O Jogo - and clearly someone in MLS decided it was time to intervene on the Red Bulls' behalf.\n\nThe 24-year-old Quintero fits the presumed age-profile for RalfBalling RBNY's transfer policy, and he is also a potential \"difference maker\": he was the MVP of the 2013 South American Youth Championship and part of Colombia's 2014 World Cup squad. He hasn't quite been the player Porto was hoping for when it signed him, but a recent loan to Independiente Medellin has seen the Colombian - not traditionally a high-scoring player - bag a flurry of goals and return to the sort of form that once had him identified as one of the best attacking players of his generation. It would seem Porto is hoping to leverage that form into a quick sale to recoup some or all of its original investment in his acquisition.\n\nThe Red Bulls, it would seem, are not taking the bait."}
{"text": "If I had to choose one word to describe Killing Floor 2, it's gruesome. It's a cooperative, zombie-killing shooter that aims to produce realism in its weaponry and environments, but all of that is buried under the blood and gore of the monsters you kill. There are many interesting things about the game from the preview I saw recently, from a huge number of animations for each gun and each enemy, to a deep perk system that makes you strategize and pick a combination of abilities to play with. But I barely gave these promising elements a thought, because, in this game, gratuitous violence masks what otherwise seems to be a good, competent shooter.\n\nDeveloper Tripwire claims that it's putting a lot of effort into making better, more varied guns and melee weapons. From my short look at the game, the team is on the right track. Guns are precisely modeled to be nearly identical to their real-life counterparts in both appearance and behavior. Separate gun parts move independently of one another, so that when you look down a gun's sights, the barrel sways differently than the body. Buckles on the sides of guns jump around as you fire.\n\nAnd the levels are beautiful. Water reflects light from street lamps as sparks fly and lights flash. Each level has its own story to tell: one shows you how the monsters are created, another presents a decimated and abandoned Paris filled with hints of the people who lived there before.\n\nHowever, these levels literally get covered in blood. When you shoot an enemy, its wound trails crimson until it dies. Unlike other games, this blood never fades. For the entire game, the pools of blood stick around, growing bigger and bigger until the ground and the walls are nothing more than canvases of red. Instead of looking upon a visually impressive, dynamic level, you're looking at a sea of blood.\n\nThis is just one part of a brand new gore system that Tripwire has implemented in Killing Floor 2. Called the M.E.A.T. System (Massive Evisceration And Trauma), it aims to make each shot brutal and destructive. Instead of five points of dismemberment as in the original Killing Floor, KF2 features nineteen. A monster's head has five places alone where it can be fragmented, and if you're accurate enough, you can blow off pieces of the skull to expose the brain. If you opt to use a shotgun instead of a precision weapon, you'll be greeted with even more gore. Raking a zombie with shotgun shells can tear it in half.\n\nAnd there's no need to try to keep zombies alive if you want to see their bodies break apart: dead bodies can still be fully dismembered. The developer even showcased one instance in which a shotgun blast launched a monster up into the air, and then using slow motion the player juggled the body by shooting it, breaking it apart before it hit the ground.\n\nThe evisceration was so pervasive that it seemed gratuitous. I couldn't focus on anything else, even though there seems to be a good game in Killing Floor 2. Without the M.E.A.T. system, the game is a cooperative shooter with stunning levels, lovingly crafted guns, and a deep perk system. Tripwire has also overhauled enemy AI to give each creature type unique abilities that change with the difficulty you're playing on. Shooting looks good, environments are beautiful, and the enemies are appropriately scary.\n\nWith the extreme violence, it seemed like almost more of a circus show, a display of the twisted and broken anatomy of these monsters. Tripwire has a good foundation for a game in Killing Floor 2. Now, they have to prove that they can balance the gruesome violence with the rest of the game when it launches this year for PC. As it stands now, painting a level in blood only made me forget about the entertaining game underneath."}

With failing hearts, these patients have no other options; heart tissue, unlike other parts of the body, is unable to heal itself once it is damaged. Fortunately, recent work by a group at Carnegie Mellon could one day lead to a world in which transplants are no longer necessary to repair damaged organs.\n\n\"We've been able to take MRI images of coronary arteries and 3-D images of embryonic hearts and 3-D bioprint them with unprecedented resolution and quality out of very soft materials like collagens, alginates and fibrins,\" said Adam Feinberg, an associate professor of Materials Science and Engineering and Biomedical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. Feinberg leads the Regenerative Biomaterials and Therapeutics Group, and the group's study was published in the October 23 issue of the journal Science Advances.\n\n\"As excellently demonstrated by Professor Feinberg's work in bioprinting, our CMU researchers continue to develop novel solutions like this for problems that can have a transformational effect on society,\" said Jim Garrett, Dean of Carnegie Mellon's College of Engineering. \"We should expect to see 3-D bioprinting continue to grow as an important tool for a large number of medical applications.\"\n\nTraditional 3-D printers build hard objects typically made of plastic or metal, and they work by depositing material onto a surface layer-by-layer to create the 3-D object. Printing each layer requires sturdy support from the layers below, so printing with soft materials like gels has been limited.\n\n\"3-D printing of various materials has been a common trend in tissue engineering in the last decade, but until now, no one had developed a method for assembling common tissue engineering gels like collagen or fibrin,\" said TJ Hinton, a graduate student in biomedical engineering at Carnegie Mellon and lead author of the study.\n\n\"The challenge with soft materials -- think about something like Jello that we eat -- is that they collapse under their own weight when 3-D printed in air,\" explained Feinberg. \"So we developed a method of printing these soft materials inside a support bath material. Essentially, we print one gel inside of another gel, which allows us to accurately position the soft material as it's being printed, layer-by-layer.\"\n\nOne of the major advances of this technique, termed FRESH, or \"Freeform Reversible Embedding of Suspended Hydrogels,\" is that the support gel can be easily melted away and removed by heating to body temperature, which does not damage the delicate biological molecules or living cells that were bioprinted. As a next step, the group is working towards incorporating real heart cells into these 3-D printed tissue structures, providing a scaffold to help form contractile muscle.\n\nBioprinting is a growing field, but to date, most 3-D bioprinters have cost over $100,000 and/or require specialized expertise to operate, limiting wider-spread adoption. Feinberg's group, however, has been able to implement their technique on a range of consumer-level 3-D printers, which cost less than $1,000 by utilizing open-source hardware and software.\n\n\"Not only is the cost low, but by using open-source software, we have access to fine-tune the print parameters, optimize what we're doing and maximize the quality of what we're printing,\" Feinberg said. \"It has really enabled us to accelerate development of new materials and innovate in this space. And we are also contributing back by releasing our 3-D printer designs under an open-source license.\"\n\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zfl_tFdt2D4&feature=youtu.be"}

Craig said this news has not caused him to withdraw support for Trump.\n\n\"To me, there's nothing in there that says any­thing about Trump that you really should have known if you knew any­thing about Trump,\" Craig said. \"He's been married three times, and he's a celebrity, and he's wealthy, and he's lived a kind of a Playboy life.

I do not dislike every­thing about Trump's private life, just some things.\"\n\nArnn said when asked about the com­ments Trump made during the second pres­i­dential debate on Oct. 9, he defended himself well. Jeffrey said in an email that it was \"heroic.\"\n\nThat is what Craig said he admires about the can­didate.\n\n\"Going into this thing, I wanted a Repub­lican,\" Craig said. \"Ini­tially, I thought I was going to be for Scott Walker because he got elected gov­ernor, and they tried to recall him and tried to destroy him. He fought back, and I said 'I want a fighter. One thing I'll say about Trump is he fights back, and I admire that.\""}
{"text": "It is not very difficult, nor is it especially flattering, to be considered a \"breath of fresh air\" on a team with a 1-30 record. But for Ish Smith, any welcoming admiration is received with open arms.\n\nSmith is everybody's favorite peripatetic. His resume is built on 10-day contracts, D-League assignments and end-of-the-bench roles. Only once in his six-year career has he spent an entire season with one team. He's been waived six times and traded five times. In a 10-month span, Smith was traded to the Pelicans and waived on the same day, signed by the 76ers, signed and waived by the Wizards, claimed by the Pelicans and traded to the 76ers.\n\nPhiladelphia's recent acquisition of Smith is the most promising move for Smith in terms of sticking around for longer than a couple of months. Whereas those other trades included Smith as an inconsequential and purely financial asset, the Sixers gave up two second-round picks to get Smith. It was a bit of an odd move for a team so focused on building from the draft to give up two high second rounders (Philly's own and one from Denver), but new chairman Jerry Colangelo wanted to bring in a player with experience with his first act in charge of the team and Smith certainly has that.\n\nThe Sixers were not exactly phlegmatic before Smith's arrival; they are a spirited young team that plays hard for Brett Brown that happens to produce depressingly bad results. Smith has given this team a bit of direction and corrected a bit of the chaos. The Sixers have won three of their nine games since his arrival and were within 10 points against the Cavs, Lakers and Jazz. Smith had a career-high 28 points on 55 percent shooting against the Raptors and he compiled double-digit assists against the Cavs, Wolves, Clippers and Jazz.\n\nEven before he was traded to the Sixers, Smith was playing well. The Pelicans started the season without Jrue Holiday and Tyreke Evans, so Smith filled in and averaged 30 minutes a game for the first month of the season. He was scoring 12 points per game and was close to the league lead in assists with an average of eight a night. When Holiday and Evans returned, Smith was banished to the back of the rotation. Although New Orleans got a very nice haul for an end of the bench guy on a one-year deal, Philadelphia was happy to get Smith back into action.\n\nSmith has a spartan skillset and most of his success can be attributed to his speed. He drives as much as Russell Westbrook (10.6 times a game) and averages 1.4 assists on drives per game, the second most in the league behind Rajon Rondo. Smith's divisive pick-and-roll game, as well as the hiring of pick-and-roll guru Mike D'Antoni, has helped both of Philadelphia's young big men become more efficient players. Rookie Jahlil Okafor is shooting 60 percent when sharing the floor with Smith, a good 12 percent increase over his season average (47.8 percent), and Nerlens Noel is shooting 68 percent (compared to 50.5 percent for the season).\n\nSmith has shown flashes of being a useful bit player at almost all of his stops, but third-string point guards on minimum deals don't have much of a shelf life. As a result, Smith has a more colorful costume closet than the late David Bowie. But in Philadelphia, where the goal is to create a semblance of structure whilst maintaining a strong lottery presence, Smith fits perfectly as the 76ers' engine. With a speedy player like Smith who can break down defense and open up gaps for the bigs to attack in the paint, Okafor and Noel are getting some genuine pick-and-roll reps, making the acquisition of Smith a developmental supplement if anything else."}
{"text": "As longtime readers may have noticed, I have an abiding interest in Neandertals. To help me keep up with the latest scientific insights into these mysterious relatives of ours, I have a Google alert set for \"Neandertal\" (and the alternate spelling, \"Neanderthal\"). I'm always excited to see the email notification that a new story about our closest relative is available for my reading pleasure. There's just one problem: nearly half the time, the story isn't about Neandertals at all. Rather the word appears as an invective hurled at whichever politician or other despised figure has attracted the writer's ire.\n\nNeandertals are the Rodney Dangerfields of the human family—they don't get no respect. Despite mounting evidence that our prehistoric cousins hunted with great skill, made beautiful stone tools, showed compassion toward one another and buried their dead, among other advanced behaviors, the word Neandertal remains a widely used pejorative. Disdain toward Neandertals lingers even after the revelation several years ago that most people today carry their DNA, thanks to long-ago hook-ups between Neandertals and anatomically modern Homo sapiens.\n\nNow a stunning new discovery underscores that it is time to welcome Neandertals in from the cold. Researchers have found markings on eagle talons from a well-known Neandertal site in Croatia that indicate Neandertals harvested the claws and wore them as jewelry. Such evidence attests to a capacity for symbolic thought, long considered a hallmark of modern humans. Davorka Radovčić of the Croatian Natural History Museum in Zagreb, David Frayer of the University of Kansas and their colleagues describe the find in a paper published March 11 in PLOS ONE.\n\nThis find is not the first to show Neandertals used raptor claws. Researchers have previously described isolated talons from several Neandertal sites in Europe. But the new discovery, from the site of Krapina in northern Croatia, includes eight talons from at least three white-tailed eagles. The cut marks and polished facets on the talons suggest human modification rather than, say, trampling by animals. The researchers suggest that the talons were part of a single piece of jewelry, possibly a necklace, tied together with string or sinew.\n\nWhat makes this discovery additionally important is that it predates by a long shot the arrival of anatomically modern Homo sapiens in Europe some 45,000 years ago. Many previous finds suggestive of Neandertal symbolism date to the interval during which Neandertals and moderns overlapped in Europe, leaving open the possibility that Neandertals simply copied the newcomers or that modern items got mixed in with Neandertal remains. But the Krapina assemblage dates to around 130,000 years ago—tens of thousands of years before moderns reached Europe. If the Neandertals there were making jewelry, their endeavor cannot be chalked up to modern influence. They must have conceived of this form of symbolic expression on their own.\n\nUltimately, such adornments feed into the million-dollar question of whether Neandertals had language, because both art and language stem from the ability to think symbolically. Archaeologists used to hold that symbolic thinking and other elements of so-called behavioral modernity emerged only within the past 50,000 years or so and in anatomically modern humans alone. But traces of symbolic behavior far older than that have emerged at early modern human sites in Africa. The fact that Neandertals decorated their bodies (and their cave homes) suggests that both Neandertals and moderns inherited this capacity for symbolic thinking—and, by extension, language—from an even older common ancestor.\n\nFor more on Neandertal cognition, check out my feature article in the February 2015 Scientific American."}
{"text": "The series\n\nOregon won at Tennessee, 48-13 in 2010, in the only other meeting between the schools, made memorable by the lightning delay and then two 70-yard-plus scoring plays by sophomores LaMichael James and Cliff Harris. Ten Ducks, though no starters, are still around for today�s rematch. For the Volunteers, defensive end Corey Miller and right tackle Ju�Wuan James started against the Ducks in 2010, and fellow senior Michael Palardy handled UT�s kickoffs then and is its full-time placekicker now.\n\nYou look remarkably like an empty seat\n\nThis will be Oregon�s 91st consecutive sellout (cough, cough) at Autzen Stadium, dating back to 1999. Only Nebraska, which hosts UCLA at 9 a.m. today, with 327 consecutive sellouts dating to 1962, and Notre Dame (232 since 1973) have longer streaks.\n\nSEC wins the football trivia battle, too\n\nThe Southeastern Conference weekly press release provides this nugget on Tennessee QB Justin Worley, who�s making his sixth start today. In his three wins, he�s completed 70 percent of his passes with five touchdowns and just one interception; in his two losses, he dropped to 45.5 percent, no TDs and three picks.\n\nFamiliarity breeds except among zebras\n\nGame Notes hates being wrong almost as much as putting its name to the end of this filler, but so it goes. Last week�s Oregon game at Virginia was not officiated by an ACC crew, as stated last week. Instead, it was a Pac-12 seven headed by referee Shawn Hochuli, the son of NFL ref Ed Hochuli. At some point, college football needs to standardize its officiating to get past the regional paranoia, because sending seven guys making nearly $1,500 per game (pay and per diem) cross country for a nonconference game makes little sense. And after 11 penalties for 119 yards against Virginia, compared with five for 33 in the Fiesta Bowl with ACC refs on patrol last January, maybe the Ducks would have preferred the Pac-12 boys stayed home, too.\n\nGreat play that should have won our day\n\nWe also whiffed last week on what should have been the special teams play-of-the-game story. How badly? Our X�s & O�s guy in his postgame blog called it a blocked field goal, which if started at the Virginia 14-yard line would have made it a 103-yard attempt. Fortunately, our own Chris Pietsch captured an excellent photo for your Sunday paper of Josh Huff�s punt block that set up Oregon�s second touchdown. Virginia�s �shield� formation gave UO special teams coach Tom Osborne plenty to exploit, and Huff, a gifted senior wide receiver, did the rest on the Ducks� five-man, jail-break rush against horrifically bad blocking. It was �Win the Day� in action at its finest, and it deserved more notice.\n\nPaging Matt Barkley to the Eagles sideline\n\nAmid the spasms of joy over the Oregon Way having taken the NFL by storm last Monday night, did anyone notice that Washington came within a successful onside kick of nearly beating the Philadelphia Eagles and robbing Chip Kelly�s game ball from beneath his chinny-chin-chin? Over-under on Michael Vick�s up-rightness this season: 10 games. Nick Foles? Two.\n\nThere�s seven of �em and they�re back again\n\nThe conference has the same seven officiating crew chiefs for the third straight season. Pac-12 refs worked 13 of the 19 games involving conference teams the first two weeks. Game Notes likes to monitor such things for silly reasons, such as maybe a 91/2-yard onside kick showing up again someday.\n\n� Ron Richmond"}
{"text": "Before-and-after adverts, showing pictures of people who have lost weight or become fitter, feature in thousands of magazines. But how reliable are they, asks Justin Parkinson.\n\nWow, what a transformation. Two volunteers go from looking pale and unfit to tanned, toned and dynamic. Before and after photos show the benefits of a change in lifestyle - eating better, exercising more and, in many cases, taking dietary supplements to help the process along.\n\nSo how long did it take for the man and woman on the left to turn into those on the right?\n\nJust under two hours.\n\nThey volunteered for photos taken as part of BBC Wales's Week In Week Out's investigation into sports supplements. The \"regime\" consisted of spray-tanning, 15 minutes of light exercise, improved posture and the introduction of more subtle lighting.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How to create the \"Before and After\" effect\n\n\"I was amazed when I first saw the difference,\" says Joe, the male volunteer, who also had his chest shaved for the shoot. \"We hardly did anything in between. There was hardly any editing of the photos, either. It just goes to show what complete rubbish some of these adverts must be.\"\n\nPhysical self-improvement is a long-established business. During the 1940s, Charles Atlas advertised his bodybuilding courses by describing himself as a the \"97lb weakling who became 'the world's most perfectly developed man'\". The pieces often featured stories of how skinny young men on beaches had followed his diktats for a short period, returned and successfully confronted bullies who had kicked sand in their faces.\n\nThese days, thousands of nutritional supplements are sold with the stated aim of helping people develop their bodies. The industry is worth more than £300m a year in the UK and, with concerns over obesity far higher than during the post-World War Two period, the global weight-loss industry is expected to be worth £220bn by 2017.\n\nThe basic formula remains the same. \"If you're in charge of advertising diet products, body-building supplements or vitamins for a client you'd pretty much get fired if you didn't come up with at least one campaign featuring a before-and-after shot,\" says Peter Davies, director of the RMS public relations agency.\n\nUnder EU rules, claims about rapid weight loss or before-and-after photographs which state or imply a rate or amount of weight loss are prohibited, according to a Health Supplements Information Service spokesman.\n\nHe adds that there is no specific prohibition against \"before-and-after\" pictures in relation to muscle gain, but using them to make a claim in relation to a product could be viewed as misleading. A protein product can only ever be marketed as providing the materials for muscle gain that is actually achieved through working out.\n\n\"One old trick clients used to try was to simply avoid the use of the words 'before' and 'after',\" says Davies. \"They'd simply print the pictures alongside each other with no text to lead the reader to assume they were 'before-and-after' images.\" However, the rules have tightened up, he adds, and \"anything that misleads the punter will be pulled\" by the Advertising Standards Authority.\n\nCould there even be an upside to before-and-after adverts?\n\n\"You could instantly see the volunteers' confidence growing after they were shown the 'after' pictures,\" says the photographer Antti Karppinen, who carried out the shoot for Week In Week Out. \"They were surprised how much better they looked.

{"text": "A SpaceX Falcon 9 moments after liftoff July 18 on a cargo mission to the International Space Station, a capability developed through the use of public-private partnerships like those endorsed by the new platform of the Republican Party.\n\nWASHINGTON — The new platform of the Republican Party includes language supporting the use of public-private partnerships to develop space capabilities, an approach that has been used by administrations of both major political parties.\n\nThe platform, formally approved by delegates at the Republican party convention July 18 in Cleveland, also features language supporting \"unfettered access\" to space and increasing the number of scientific missions.\n\nThe 54-page document includes two paragraphs about space in a section about technology policy nearly one page long. One paragraph focuses on the use of public-private partnerships.\n\n\"The public-private partnerships between NASA, the Department of Defense, and commercial companies have given us technological progress that has reduced the cost of accessing space and extended America's space leadership in the commercial, civil, and national security spheres,\" it states. \"The entrepreneurship and innovation culture of the free market is revitalizing the nation's space capabilities, saving taxpayer money, and advancing technology critical to maintain America's edge in space and in other fields.\"\n\nThe platform doesn't give specific examples of those partnerships, but NASA has made significant use of them under both the current and previous presidential administrations. NASA started the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program in 2005 to develop spacecraft to transport cargo to the International Space Station. COTS was run as a public-private partnership through the use of funded Space Act Agreements, with companies expected to supplement the NASA funds with their own to support vehicle development.\n\nCOTS led to the development of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft, and Orbital Sciences Corp.'s Antares rocket and Cygnus spacecraft. Both companies won Commercial Resupply Services contracts from NASA to transport cargo to and from the ISS in December 2008, a month before the end of the presidency of George W. Bush.\n\nUnder the Obama Administration, NASA adopted a similar approach for commercial crew systems, awarding a series of funded Space Act Agreements to several companies to support vehicle and other technology capabilities. NASA ultimately gave contracts in September 2014 to Boeing and SpaceX for their CST-100 Starliner and Crew Dragon spacecraft.\n\nThe following paragraph of the platform offered more general policy guidance for civil and national security space. \"To protect our national security interests and foster innovation and competitiveness, we must sustain our preeminence in space by launching more scientific missions, guaranteeing unfettered access, and ensuring that our space-related industries remain a source of scientific leadership and education,\" it states.\n\nThe platform doesn't elaborate on those positions, including what kinds of scientific missions should be launched or how it defines \"unfettered access\" to space. That passage is similar to language in the party's 2012 platform, which stated, \"To preserve our national security interests and foster innovation and competitiveness, we must sustain our preeminence in space, launching more science missions, guaranteeing unfettered access, and maintaining a source of high-value American jobs.\"\n\nThe platform did not include any criticism of the Obama Administration's space policy, such as the cancellation of the Constellation program in 2010. Eileen Collins, the former astronaut who will speak briefly at the convention July 20, did criticize that decision in congressional testimony earlier this year. The document also does not go into details on military space policy, beyond a call to \"fund, develop, and deploy a multi-layered missile defense system.\"\n\nA draft version of the Democratic Party platform, dated July 1, makes no mention of space, but does state that the party supports \"ambitious public and private investments in science, technology, and research.\" The final version of the platform will be approved by delegates at the party's convention the week of July 25 in Philadelphia.\n\nOriginally published on Space News."}

Aldridge had 25 points and 14 rebounds and Damian Lillard scored 26 but missed 12 of 19 from the field.\n\nBatum also struggled in that defeat, missing all eight of his shots and finishing with two points and 10 boards.\n\nLillard is looking for a bounce-back effort against the Mavericks (40-22) after he missed 12 of 13 attempts, including all seven from 3-point range, to finish with a season-low five points Wednesday. Lillard, who had a carer-high 18 rebounds, totaled 60 points on 50.0 percent shooting over the previous two games.\n\n\"The most important thing was that we played the type of basketball we needed to down the stretch to win the game, and I still found a way to impact the game,\" Lillard said.\n\nThe Blazers are atop the Northwest Division, percentage points ahead of Houston for the third seed in the Western Conference. Expanding that lead may be difficult as they've dropped five of seven meetings with Dallas, which could be getting Parsons (ankle) and Chandler (hip) back from injury. Parsons has missed five games and Chandler three and both are with the team at the start of this three-game trip.\n\nParsons is third on the team with 15.4 points per game, while Chandler ranks among the NBA leaders with 11.7 rebounds.\n\nThey were essential to last month's win over Portland. Parsons had 20 points, nine boards and three steals and Chandler added 11 points and 13 rebounds.\n\nDallas overcame their absences Monday, avoiding a three-game slide as six players scored in double digits to beat New Orleans 102-93.\n\n\"That's why it is a team,\" coach Rick Carlisle said. \"We're a strength-in-numbers type of team.\"\n\nHaving a productive Rajon Rondo at the point also helps. The guard had 19 points on 9-of-15 shooting in his best performance since being suspended one game following a heated exchange of words with Carlisle during a 99-92 win over Toronto on Feb. 24.\n\n\"He's done a great job,\" Carlisle said. \"Again, he's learning what it takes to play with our players and vice versa. We're on a path where we're going to figure it out.\n\n\"He's looking to be aggressive. He's looking to make aggressive paint and rim attacks, and when he can finish it's great and when he draws one or two guys, he can find the right guy. That's where his special ability is.\"\n\nRondo missed the last matchup with Portland due to an Achilles injury.\n\nCopyright 2015 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

{"text": "ATHENS, OH – According to a study published last week by food scientists at Ohio University, local squirrels have adapted to a new and unique diet. Typically, squirrels fill their tiny cheeks with acorns, seeds, nuts, and insects — but Athens squirrels are far from ordinary.\n\n\"We had suspected for quite some time that there was something unique about the squirrels that roam college green,\" Dr. Jane Hernandez, an Ohio University nutrition professor and researcher told The Black Sheep. \"But we hadn't expected to find such a dramatic departure from the usual dietary habits of squirrels.\"\n\nThe study suggests that over the many generations of living in a college town, local squirrels have changed their food preference from nuts, seeds, and insects, to discarded sub sandwiches, abandoned burritos, and most of all, half-eaten pieces of pepperoni pizza.\n\nSound familiar? Researchers believe that university students, who have been back in Athens for just over a week, are directly responsible for this shocking dietary change. Dr. Hernandez described the squirrels' eating habits as being \"very similar to a typical college students' late-night feasting.\"\n\nOpening weekend, the weekend before classes began, was a big day not only for new and returning students. It was also a feast for Athens squirrels, who had suffered considerably over the 3-month summer break. When students returned to campus, so did the squirrels' lifeline: dropped drunk food.\n\nThe study also revealed that due to this unique diet, Athens squirrels have experienced intense genetic mutation, and are actually considered an entirely new subspecies of squirrel. Athens squirrels are much larger than the average Midwestern rodent, they are more hostile, and are much more prone to health problems like obesity, high cholesterol, and even alcohol dependency.\n\n\"Most people who live near campus have experienced some of the hostility that is common in this new, Athens subspecies,\" Dr. Hernandez explained. \"Sometimes the squirrels will throw acorns at students. We think this is their way of saying, 'Please give me half of your Jimmy John's,' or, 'Drop your Chipotle and nobody gets hurt.'\"\n\nThis phenomenon hasn't gone unnoticed by students, who have always been curious about the cohabiting species. Days before the official study was published, sophomore sports management major Kaden Gongerich captured an image of a local squirrel, eating a forgotten piece of pizza. Gongerich, having no idea that this piece of pizza was an average brunch for the squirrel, promptly shared the image to OUSnaps, a Snapchat account that many OU students follow. The caption read \"This happened.\"\n\nIt did, indeed.\n\n\"What students need to understand,\" Dr. Hernandez said, \"is that Athens squirrels have become dependent upon students' wasted, unwanted, dropped, and discarded meals. These animals need these greasy foods in order to survive. This is not a joke. This is life or death.\"\n\nOU students have responded to the revelation with support and creativity. Many have promised to leave half of their Friday night O'Betty's for the squirrels on College Green, sources told The Black Sheep. One student, junior Eric McFarland, is organizing an Athens Squirrel Fest, which will take place at his home on Palmer St. this Friday. He encourages his classmates to \"show up, get drunk, and leave a little something for the squirrels.\"\n\nMcFarland also hopes to see a few Athens squirrels at his party.\n\n\"I read about the study a few days ago and I couldn't believe it,\" Gongerich said. \"But then I thought, 'If I were a squirrel, I would choose day-old DP Dough over an acorn any day.'\"\n\nWant to seem more stuff from The Black Sheep at Ohio?

{"text": "Conservative councillor and parliamentary candidate Mike Whitehead has become the latest person to defect to Ukip to much praise from Nigel Farage, but his former party insist they struck him off last week.\n\nWhitehead currently sits on East Riding Council and was in place to fight for the Labour safe seat Hull West and Hessle constituency for the Tories but announced on Monday he would be joining the anti-EU party.\n\nJust spoken to Tory parliamentary candidate for Hull West and Hessle, Mike Whitehead, who has now left the Conservatives and joined UKIP! — Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) April 6, 2015\n\nNigel Farage described the news as \"another hammer blow to Tory pretensions in the north of England\", but a Conservative Party spokesperson dismissed the announcement.\n\nHe said: \"This man is not our candidate for Hull West and Hessle. He was sacked last week.\n\n\"He refused to support the local Conservative council candidate and so we wrote to him last week to say that his position was untenable and he could not stand for us at the general election.\n\n\"We were already selecting a new candidate for this constituency.\n\n\"This is typical Ukip - cynical, misleading and utterly calculating to try and score political points.\"\n\nMike Whitehead\n\nWhen asked if they were aware of Whitehead's sacking, a Ukip spokesperson said: \"I am now.\n\n\"It's possible he told someone else in the party. It was an oversight.\"\n\nWhitehead has since admitted to BBC Radio 5 Live he was deselected, and the Conservative Party have released a copy of an email sent to him last week.\n\nHere is the email the tories claim they sent Mike Whitehead sacking him as a candidate on 1 April: pic.twitter.com/f1bCIjJT7H — Harry Cole (@MrHarryCole) April 6, 2015\n\nFarage said: \"I am delighted to be welcoming Mike to the party at this exciting time.\n\n\"His move to Ukip just underlines that today the real party of opposition to Labour in the north is Ukip.\"\n\nWhitehead said he had been increasingly worried about the behaviour of the controlling group of Tories since 2011, when seven Conservative councillors from Haltemprice and Howden resigned, citing bullying and intimidation.\n\nHe added: \"In my opinion, the behaviour of the ruling group has only gotten worse since then.\n\n\"Now, that same group have managed to gain control of the local party structures by ensuring they are responsible for the organisation of the local election campaign.\n\nA screenshot from Mike Whitehead's website before he was sacked\n\n\"However, the Conservative Party at national level has declined to get involved in what it sees as a remote internal squabble out in the shires.\n\n\"The total power of single party control without effective opposition is never a good situation as we have seen from recent events elsewhere in Yorkshire.\n\n\"I could not in good conscience continue supporting the local Conservative party when they are obsessed with going down the same road.\"\n\nAs a member of Ukip he would be better able to speak up for residents and represent their views on the council, he added.\n\nHe went on: \"I also hope that with the election of other Ukip councillors, I can help open this secretive council up and make it more transparent and work better for the residents rather than to the benefit of the few.\"\n\nHe said he wanted to ensure the local authority works more closely with other agencies including Hull City Council and Humberside Police.\n\n\"It is important that we remove petty fiefdoms and ensure this region is not left behind when greater resources are devolved by the next Government,\" he added.\n\nHull West and Hessle is safe Labour territory - former home secretary Alan Johnson is defending a 5,700 majority from the 2010 general election when the Conservatives finished third."}
{"text": "← Beginning Fortran | Fortran simple input and output →\n\n\nIn programming, a variable is a container for data that the program can change. You typically declare variables before you use them to provide information on what kind of data they should store. However, Fortran allows variables to be created implicitly. Absent an IMPLICIT statement, undeclared variables and arguments beginning with I through N (the \"in\" group) will be INTEGER , and all other undeclared variables and arguments will be REAL .\n\nMany consider using variables without declaring them bad practice. If you want to be forced to declare variables, code IMPLICIT NONE first.\n\nExamples of variables:\n\nINTEGER , PARAMETER :: num_days_week = 7 ! declare a constant, whose value cannot be changed INTEGER :: i , j ( 2 ), k ( 0 : 1 ), m ( 3 , 4 ) ! declare i as an integer, j as an array of 2 ! integers from j(1) to j(2), k as an array ! of 2 integers from '''k(0)''' to k(1), and m as a 2-dimensional ! array of 12 elements REAL :: c ( 0 : 3 ) ! declare c as an array of 4 floating point numbers from c(0) to c(3) CHARACTER ( LEN = 5 ) :: word ! declare word as a string of length 5 LOGICAL :: tf ! declare a boolean variable with values .TRUE. or .FALSE.\n\nThe following does exactly the same thing, but in the shorter, more archaic form:\n\nINTEGER , PARAMETER :: num_days_week = 7 DIMENSION j ( 2 ), k ( 0 : 1 ), m ( 3 , 4 ), c ( 0 : 3 ) CHARACTER * 5 word LOGICAL tf\n\nIf memory layout counts to you, note that m(1,1) is followed in memory by m(2,1), and not by m(1,2).\n\nA variable can be set by placing it before an equal sign, which is followed by the value to which it is set. Given the declarations above, the following assignments are possible:\n\ni = 3 * 4 ! set i to 3*4 = 12 j = ( / 1 , 4 / ) ! set j(1) to 1, j(2) to 4 c = ( / 1.0 , 4.0 , 5.0 , 9.0 / ) ! set c(0) to 1.0, c(1) to 4.0, c(2) to 5.0, c(3) to 9.0 word = 'dog' ! set word = \"dog \" . The variable word is padded with spaces on the right tf = . TRUE . ! set tf to True\n\nA variable can appear on both sides of an assignment. The right hand side is evaluated first, and the variable is then assigned to that value:\n\ni = 3 ! i has value 3 i = i ** i ! i has value 3**3 = 27\n\nVariables can be converted from one type to another, but unlike in C++ or Java where you would typecast the variable, in Fortran you use the intrinsic procedures:\n\nREAL :: r = 1.5 DOUBLE PRECISION :: d = 1.5 INTEGER :: i = 1 PRINT * , DBLE ( r ), DBLE ( d ), DBLE ( i ) ! Convert number to a double precision PRINT * , REAL ( r ), REAL ( d ), REAL ( i ) ! Convert number to a single precision (REAL) PRINT * , INT ( r ), INT ( d ), INT ( i ) ! Convert number to an integer\n\nAgain, the same thing in the simpler, archaic form:"}
{"text": "In efforts to transition myself to the Infrastructure side of the house, I decided to hit the white board a bit and explain the architecture of the current environment I am in. This is part of my Design Theory study (VCAP-Design) and is as much for reader benefit, as it is for my own learning benefit. I hope this brings forth questions and discussions. As a preemptive note: I am not the Principal Architect of this specific design. I merely inherited this design, and am learning it while taking over. This is not a post that I am going to whittle down to be perfect as if I was submitting for VCDX. I will try my best to keep it clear, concise, and in a proper order from the top down.\n\nSo let's get this party started. The environment that I support now has several vCenter servers. These are spread across several geographic locations. We do have one \"Primary\" location, that has 2 different buildings. The \"main\" building houses our primary vCenter. This vCenter houses a couple legacy 1-Gig clusters, and our primary 10-Gig environment.\n\nOur 10-Gig environment is currently split into 2 pods. These pods were built to be scalable, as needed. As a vEUC guy, I equate this design to the Horizon View \"pod and block\" type architecture. Scalable Pods that can be built out as needed. It's a popular concept these days. Maybe not in this exact design, but scalability is important.\n\nOur Pods are built in sets of 3 racks. Unlike our 1-Gig environment where we run all cabling to the distribution switches, our 10-Gig pods utilize 2 x Force10 Z9000's in a Top-of-Rack or TOR setup for each 3-rack pod. Each TOR switch and Server in the pod are dual-homed with A/B power to separate PDU's. The building has multiple street-power providers, and is rated to withstand an F5 tornado. Here is a visual representation of the pod:\n\nThe switches are setup in an A/B setup cross-connected to each other. The switches reside in the center rack in each pod, as it services the cabinet it resides in, as well as the neighbors to the left and right:\n\nThe switch ports are all configured as Trunk. We handle all of our tagging at the vSwitch. Each ESX host (R710's or R720's) house 2 x 8GB HBA's for storage, and 2 x Dual-Port 10-Gig NIC's for networking. We use 1:4 fan-out 40-Gig cables for network connectivity, like the ones here. Each 40-Gig cable has 4 ends (A,B,C,D). Each 40-Gig cable services the \"A\" or \"B\" switch side of 2 hosts, with 2 connections each.\n\nThis leaves each host with an A + B (or C & D) from the \"A Switch\" and an A + B (or C & D) from the \"B Switch\". These are split out on the host to 2 x Virtual Distributed Switches across the environment:\n\n10GB-VM-Network\n\n10GB-vKernel-Network\n\nTwo of the links (1 x A-side, 1 x B-side) go to the VM-Network Virtual Distributed Switch. The other 2 links go to the vKernel-Network Virtual Distributed Switch. The vKernel Switch for each host has 1 x Management and 1 x vMotion virtual adapter configured. The VM-Network Switch contains the tagged port-groups for all of the VLAN's needed for our virtual machine traffic.\n\nThis concludes the first of what I hope to be many Design Theory / Architectural posts. Thanks for playing along!\n\n-vTimD"}
{"text": "Marriage is an abstract concept that, frankly, most young children don't fully understand. For them, it's usually good enough to know that when grown-ups love each other very much and want to be a family together, they get often get married. There's no need to discuss the tax implications or workplace benefits or hospital visitation rights with a three-year-old. But is it necessary to limit the concept to the traditional one-man-one-woman definition just because you're talking to a three-year-old? Even if you, personally, are okay with the idea of same-sex marriage? Even if you live in a country where same-sex marriage is legal? Lisa van de Geyn, writing in Today's Parent, seems to think so, because talking about same-sex marriage is hard.\n\n\nWhen the subject of marriage came up between her and her three-year-old daughter — after Mrs. van de Geyn suggested that the cartoon character Handy Manny ought to marry his friend Kelly — she laid down the law on same-sex marriage: \"Girls don't marry other girls. Girls marry boys and boys marry girls.\"\n\nShe goes on to say that it's not a religious or political matter for her, or even her own personal beliefs, but instead that the \"conversation totally came out of left field\" and she simply wasn't ready for it. Now, I'm not going to fault her for panicking and saying the wrong thing when she was put on the line by her kid — the girl asked if Handy Manny and Mr. Lopart should get married — even though she did bring up the topic. She could, very easily, revisit the subject, letting her daughter know that she made a mistake and that boys can indeed marry boys. Instead, it's what she said at the end of her article that I want to call her out on.\n\nMrs. van de Geyn ends her piece by saying that \"I don't regret telling her that boys marry girls and girls marry boys. I don't feel it's a topic appropriate for her age.\" Why isn't same-sex marriage a suitable topic for a three-year-old? I can understand not wanting to discuss, for example, the use of bondage for sexual gratification or the meaning of the word santorum, but same-sex marriage is a problem? Seriously?\n\nWhat Mrs. van de Geyn is really saying is that boy-girl marriage is okay but boy-boy or girl-girl marriage is icky-poo-poo. And that's not an okay message for parents to tell their kids.\n\nThere have been far too many suicides and murders because of this precise point of view to let it continue for another generation. There are far too many wonderful people being treated like second-class citizens to let this go. There are too many loving couples who can't legally say \"I do\" because of people who feel this way. You don't get to perpetuate bigotry simply because talking to your kids makes you uncomfortable. If you have kids, you have to deal with the difficult stuff along with the cute stuff. You can't weasel out of it at someone else's expense.\n\nIn her article, Mrs. van de Geyn asks \"what would you have told your kid?\" and my answer is what I have already told my three-year-old — that marriage is when people love each other very much and want to become a family, they may choose to get married. That way, they know what's important about marriage — love. There are no judgments, no limitations, no prerequisites, other than love. What matters is what's inside. That's a lesson it seems some adults need to learn as well.\n\nTags: civil rights, discrimination, equality, freedom, gay, gay marriage, glbt, lgbt, marriage, marriage equality, prop8, talking, toddlers"}
{"text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal jury in Brooklyn on Monday found a former New York Democratic state senator, whose brief flirtation with the Republican party gridlocked the senate, guilty of embezzling money from federally funded healthcare clinics.\n\nNew York State Senator Pedro Espada joins other legislators in a news conference on the steps of City Hall in New York City, demanding Mayor Bloomberg negotiate with them before they vote to reinstate his control of the largest school system in the United States, July 19, 2009. REUTERS/Chip East\n\nBut the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict on related conspiracy charges.\n\nPedro Espada Jr. and his son, Pedro Gautier Espada, were accused of bilking more than $600,000 from Soundview HealthCare Center, which has received more than $1 million in federal funding. The elder Espada, a former three-term Democratic senator representing the Bronx, serves as CEO of Soundview, which was founded in 1978.\n\nAfter 11 days of tense deliberations, the jury on Monday told U.S. District Judge Frederic Block that Espada, 58, was guilty of four counts of theft. The jury then deliberated for several more hours before announcing they were unable to reach a verdict on the remaining four counts against Espada, which included theft and conspiracy.\n\nA mistrial was declared on all eight counts against Pedro Gautier Espada.\n\nBlock gave prosecutors until June 5 to decide whether to retry the Espadas on all or some of the undetermined counts.\n\nAfter the verdict was read, Espada appeared somber, comforting his wife in the courtroom.\n\n\"It's a sad day for Mr. Espada, and a sadder day for Soundview and the community,\" Espada's attorney, Susan Necheles, said outside the courthouse.\n\nBrooklyn U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said Espada will \"now be held to account for his crimes.\"\n\n\"The people of the Bronx trusted Pedro Espada to have their best interests at heart,\" Lynch said in a statement following the verdict. \"Instead, he abused that trust to the tune of more than half a million dollars.\"\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo also weighed in on the verdict, calling Espada \"the prime example of government corruption.\"\n\nACCUSATIONS OF BULLYING\n\nDeliberations nearly ground to a halt several times in the two weeks since the jury received the case. On Wednesday, Block told jurors to resume deliberations after they sent him a note that they were \"deadlocked.\" In other notes, there were complaints that one juror refused to deliberate and accusations of bullying.\n\nDuring the six-week trial, witnesses for the government included Maria Cruz, Espada's long-time assistant, who said he put family members on Soundview's payroll and its board of directors.\n\nOther Soundview employees testified that Espada routinely spent clinic funds on personal items like presents and flowers, fancy meals and even an elaborate child's birthday party featuring a pony. The Espadas also were accused of rigging bids for cleaning contracts with Soundview.\n\nNecheles acknowledged during the trial that her client spent Soundview's money, but only as part of his contract, which entitled him to pay certain personal expenses with company funds. If any of the funds were used improperly, it was the fault of Soundview's accountants, who apparently green-lit the payments, she said.\n\nEspada, who served as New York Senate majority leader from 2009 until 2010, was ousted from his Senate seat in the 2010 primary election. He faces up to 40 years in prison for the counts on which he has been convicted.\n\nHis son, who was a member of the New York Assembly and helped his father run parts of Soundview, faced 10 years on each of the five counts of theft, and 15 years on the three conspiracy counts."}

Brigades from the Military Council of the Free Army are participating in the operation, alongside others from the Ababil Horan Brigade, Martyrs of Damascus, the Husayn Bin Ali Battalion, Infantry Division 24, al-Haramain Brigade, Shabab al-Huda (Huda Youth Brigade), in addition to Jabhat al-Nusra, the Levant Liberation Band and Liwa al-Fatihin.\n\nThis operation aims to take over the 90th Brigade's fort, affiliated with the Free Syrian Army in the middle area of Quneitra.\n\nThe media office of the Syrian Rebels Front said they took over a military unit in Ain al-Darb and its neighboring farms.\n\nThis operation is the first in months in the Golan, where militants were able to take over the Red Hills near the border with the occupied Golan, while the army was able to regain control over the middle area.\n\nThis attack aims to secure larger areas under the control of militants on one hand, and to create a connection between the countryside of Quneitra and the countryside of Houran, on the other hand.\n\nIt is intriguing that Jabhat al-Nusra is participating in the clashes alongside the Free Syrian Army after it distanced itself from previous battles due to the tension between them and the other factions in Houran, after the leader of Jabhat al-Nusra's military council, Ahmad al-Nehme was arrested. During the past few days, Jabhat al-Nusra invaded a number of villages that are under the control of the Free Syrian Army.\n\nThe Syrian news agency, SANA, said militants committed a massacre in Khotab in the countryside of Hama, killing 14 people.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported, \"The casualties included children and women, others were executed and their bodies dismembered by the brigades in that area.\" Minister of Justice Najm al-Ahmad declared that a committee is being formed to investigate what happened in the village.\n\nSources affiliated with the armed opposition accused the dead of being \"informants\" who work for the Syrian forces.\n\nIn Idlib, clashes continue around the Hamidiya camp, south of Maarat al-Numaan, while the Observatory for Human Rights said militants took over a checkpoint near the camp. Clashes also continue in the neighboring area of Madajen.\n\nIn Hasakah, a suicide bomber from IS targeted a Kurdish People's Protection Units checkpoint in Ain al-Arab, around which clashes between IS and the Kurdish units have been occurring.\n\nIn Eastern Ghouta, Jaysh al-Islam militants attacked an IS office in Midaa and Misraba, amid reports of the death of a number of IS emirs, including Abu Mohamed al-Homsi, Abu Jaafar and Abu Hamzeh.

{"text": "Play 05:03 Play 05:03 Holding: Chanderpaul always did what was necessary\n\nAfter more than two decades and 164 Test matches, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, one of West Indies' finest batsmen, has retired. Chanderpaul finishes as the second-highest West Indian Test run-maker, 86 runs short of Brian Lara: Lara got 11,953 (11,912 for West Indies and the rest for the ICC World XI), while Chanderpaul scored 11,867 (all for West Indies).\n\nChanderpaul, 41, had not played for West Indies since May 2015; the West Indies selectors dropped him after a weak performance during the three-Test series at home against England. While Chanderpaul entertained hopes of a comeback, the selection panel, headed by former West Indies captain Clive Lloyd, had provided enough hints that they had moved past Chanderpaul as they ignored him for the various series in the last eight months. Chanderpaul was also not part of the 15 players handed annual contracts by the WICB in December.\n\nLast June Chanderpaul had said he would decide by the end of the year when he would exit the international scene. \"Definitely, but I am on the outside, just waiting to see what is happening,\" Chanderpaul told cricket365.com, when asked if he wanted to play Tests again. \"Retirement isn't on the cards at the moment. Not for now, probably the ending of the year maybe then.\"\n\nThat his desire to play on continued to be strong was evident from the fact that he remained part of the regional domestic tournaments and, in fact, played his last match just three days ago, in the semi-final of the Nagico Super50 one-day tournament for Guyana.\n\nThe WICB said in a release that Chanderpaul formally notified the board \"in an email that he will no longer be available for selection for West Indies\". \"The WICB acknowledges the invaluable contribution Shiv has made to the game globally, and we wish him all the best,\" WICB president Dave Cameron said.\n\nOne big reason for Chanderpaul to re-think his international career could be his involvement with the Masters Champions League (MCL), a tournament for players who have left all professional forms of the game including domestic cricket, which begins on January 28 in Dubai. To participate in the MCL, players have to get no-objection certificates from their respective boards stating that they have retired from all forms of cricket. Incidentally, till Thursday the WICB had not been approached for an NOC by any player. Chanderpaul was signed for $30,000 to represent Gemini Arabians in the tournament.\n\nChanderpaul is only the second modern-day player, after Sachin Tendulkar, whose career stretched over two decades. He might not have been as celebrated and revered as Tendulkar, but Chanderpaul had worked hard, quietly, to become one of the strongest pillars of West Indies cricket.\n\nHe scored 30 Test centuries and averaged 51.37 in the format, and held numerous records that are likely to last for a long time, including batting for more than 25 hours in a Test series between dismissals - he did it against India in 2002, when he faced 1050 consecutive deliveries without losing his wicket.\n\nUnorthodox stance and great determination aside, Chanderpaul never allowed his emotions to overpower him or pour over on the outside. Perhaps that reserved nature of his explained why he led West Indies only 14 times in Tests. He also played 268 ODIs for 8778 runs at 41.60 (the last of which was during the 2011 World Cup), and 22 T20Is.\n\nNagraj Gollapudi is an assistant editor at ESPNcricinfo\n\n© ESPN Sports Media Ltd."}

Hammons and Isaac Haas play alongside one another in a lineup anchored by a pair of 7-footers for Purdue?\n\n\"It sure looked like it today,\" guard Bryson Scott said after the Boilermakers' scrimmage in Mackey Arena.\n\nIndeed, things were very basic on Saturday, but the moments Purdue ran the gigantic lineup out there, it worked.\n\n\"I feel like we can play together,\" Hammons said, \"but I'd like to see how it goes against another team instead of (a scrimmage).\"\n\nThere was one sequence where Haas caught the ball near the baseline, his back to the basket right of the rim. Hammons cut to the basket and Haas twice dumped passes to him for easy dunks.\n\n\"We were working on that a little bit before practice yesterday,\" Hammons said, \"because Coach said we'd be running it, but I didn't really expect him to really be looking at me when I was diving. We had some good chemistry but I do want to see how it goes against another team.\"\n\nWhether they were playing together or against each other, it was a big afternoon for both.\n\nHammons led all scorers with 22 points in the scrimmage, in which lineups were fluid. His team won all three scrimmage sessions. He also had nine rebounds and three blocked shots, looking spry and explosive off the floor on his numerous two-handed dunks.\n\nHe also made two of the three three-pointers he made, a phase of his game Purdue's given him leeway to explore, particularly perhaps when he's at the 4 when Haas is in at center.\n\n\"He said as long as they're good shots, smart shots and not really contested, he said I'm allowed to shoot them. I'm glad about that,\" Hammons said.\n\n\"It might surprise some people a little bit. They might not be expecting it. And if people close out hard on me, I can drive it a little bit. I do have a floater game you all haven't seen yet (joking). We're working on that.\"\n\nHaas, meanwhile, scored 17 points with seven rebounds. A few of his field goals came head-to-head against Hammons down low. Otherwise, he lived at the foul line and made 11-of-13.\n\n\"He got great position, kept the ball really high and he hit all his free throws,\" Hammons said.\n\nPurdue relishes having Hammons and Haas practicing against each other for the competition it's brought to the practice floor.\n\nBut it will continue to explore their potential as a tandem.\n\nHe will take part in next week's scrimmage - Saturday at 3 p.m. and open to the public - though.\n\n\"I thought he was great,\" Painter said. \"He's probably not been through a full practice in a week-and-a-half, two weeks. He's jumped into a couple and gotten hurt right away.\n\n\"He's been better in practice,\" Painter said. \"He didn't have a good day today, but he's done some good things. His ability to stretch defenses is going to be a weapon for us.\"\n\nStephens was one of several Boilermakers to struggle from deep, as the team made just a combined 5-of-40.\n\nMathias was 0-for-5 and Rapheal Davis 1-of-7.\n\nOther double-figure scorers for Purdue were P.J. Thompson (12 points) and Scott (11).\n\nPainter and Scott each said that the sophomore is solely being used at the point guard position right now, though Scott said he thinks he might get opportunities to play some away from the ball."}
{"text": "The United Nations Representative for International Migration, Peter Sutherland , has warned that the common humanity of Europeans could be sacrificed by a populist anti-immigrant mood fuelled by misinformation or a lack of information.\n\nMr Sutherland said yesterday the disgraceful situation in the refugee camp in Calais reflected European disarray on migration and refugees.\n\nHe said while the EU had made sensible proposals, a number of states, mainly in central and eastern Europe, had refused to subscribe and participate.\n\n\"If Germany can handle 800,000 to one million refugees this year, plus 500,000 a year for the following five years, why can't France (with help from the UK) not solve the problem of 3,000 people in Calais?\n\n\"For that matter why cannot every EU country (including the UK) share fairly in the relocation of migrants from Greece and Italy in particular, and also the resettlement of refugees from Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon?\"\n\nMr Sutherland, a former EU commissioner, was speaking at a conference on boat migrants held in UCD yesterday.\n\nHe told the conference he had visited the Calais camp two weeks ago on a day of serious disturbances.\n\nTruly shocking\n\n\"The conditions in which the migrants were living were truly shocking. Doctors there told me of clear evidence of TB and scabies. This is a disgrace. It is also a clear example of the broader inadequacies in Europe's practical expression of its much vaunted values.\"\n\nMr Sutherland said notwithstanding an estimated 60 per cent of the 3,000 in the camp probably being eligible for refugee status, there was a reluctance by governments to follow through, on the basis the host county would then have to grant asylum.\n\nHe said the people there remained determined \"by hook or by crook\" to make it to the UK.\n\n\"The site itself is a living reproach to European society – a desperate place populated by desperate people. There, the one shaft of light is to be found in the stream – even a tide – of volunteer helpers. These often come from micro NGOs from France, the UK and some from Ireland,\" he said.\n\nMr Sutherland traced the background of the people in the camp, the majority of whom have fled from war-torn countries.\n\n\"The compulsion to leave was obviously so powerful that the migrants were prepared to spend their last pennies and risk their lives in rickety boats to escape.\"\n\nOver 2,700 have drowned this year. Others have been dying for years in the Mediterranean, but it took one heart-rending photograph to bring a temporary constructive reaction.\"\n\nCatastrophe\n\nHe suggested that if people were assessed before they left north Africa, then the catastrophes that have occurred would reduce greatly in number.\n\nHe said the continuing state of affairs threatened the internal cohesion of the EU and the maintenance of European values. He argued for a common EU policy for migrants and refugees, which he said was \"indispensable\" for the improvement of the current situation.\n\n\"This policy must recognise that proximity does not create responsibility for migrants or refugees. Why should Lebanon have over one-quarter of its population made up of Syrian refugees? Or why should Turkey have 1.7 million? For that matter, why should Italy and Greece have such disproportionate numbers just because they are on the Mediterranean?\n\n\"Why did the UK agree to take less than 5,000 a year for the next few years from outside the EU for resettlement, but none from Greece or Italy for relocation from inside?

{"text": "Mary Barra, GM's first woman CEO offered apologies in a Congressional hearing on Tuesday, but no real explanation for the fact that the car company failed to fix a problem it knew about that endangered people's lives. A faulty ignition switch, which caused cars to abruptly shut off, shutting down all systems inlcuding power steering and air bag deployment, is known to have caused the deaths of 13 people. She did promise to investigate it, though. During the hearing, Congresswoman Diana DeGette held up one of the defective switches, and pointed out that it could have been fixed for 57 cents per car.\n\nDocumentary filmmaker Michael Moore vented his rage about GM's callousness immediately on his Facebook page. It is strong stuff, but many share his outrage over unnecessary deaths, and corporate malfeasance. Of course, it is hard to arrest the \"profit motive\" or \"runaway capitalism,\" which he cites as the real culprits, so maybe just hunt down the executives who knew full well they were putting people's lives in jeopardy.\n\nIn Moore's words:\n\nSPONSORED\n\nI am opposed to the death penalty, but to every rule there is usually an exception, and in this case I hope the criminals at General Motors will be arrested and made to pay for their pre-meditated decision to take human lives for a lousy ten bucks. The executives at GM knew for 13 years that their cars had a defective ignition switch that would, well, kill people. But they did a \"cost-benefit analysis\" and concluded that paying off the deceased's relatives was going to be cheaper than having to install a $10 part per car. They then covered up their findings and continued to let millions drive around with the defective part in their cars. There would be no recalls. There would only be parents and the decapitated body parts of their dead children. See the USA in your Chevrolet. In 2007 a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration official recommended a formal investigation but was overruled by others in Bush's \"business-friendly\" Transportation Department.\n\nOnly now, under the newly-configured GM -- owned, essentially, by you and me from 2009 through last year -- has the truth come out. And my guess is that it has to do with the fact that a mother now runs General Motors. A few months ago, Mary Barra, a former resident of Flint, the daughter of GM union autoworker, was named its CEO. And it looks like she isn't one of the good ol' boys. She stepped forward, announced the truth of what GM did, ordered one massive recall after another, and now is showing up to face Congress in a few hours.\n\nThe Washington Post, in an otherwise good article, blames the whole sad affair on the \"corporate culture\" at GM. What a user-friendly term! To even have to read the words \"culture\" and \"General Motors\" in the same sentence is enough to make anyone gag. No, the cause of this tragedy is an economic system that places profit above everything else, including -- and especially -- human life. GM has a legal and fiduciary responsibility to its shareholders to make the biggest profits that it can. And if their top people crunch the numbers and can show that they will save more money by NOT fixing or replacing the part, then that is what they are going to goddam well do. F*** you, f*** me, and f*** everybody they sent to their deaths. That pretty much sums up their \"culture\". They knew they wouldn't get caught, and if they did, no one would ever serve any time.\n\nI hope someone in the Obama administration will get out the handcuffs, the SWAT teams, or the U.S. army if need be, march into GM headquarters in downtown Detroit and haul away anyone who is there who had anything to do with this. And if they already left town, hunt them down and bring them in to face justice."}
{"text": "RIO DE JANEIRO — They don't make as much money as their counterparts of the opposite sex. They don't receive as much TV airtime or media coverage. They don't attract as many fans to arenas or as many followers on social media.\n\nThis sounds like a typical gender inequality story in American sports except for one thing: In gymnastics, the men are less popular than the women.\n\nThe chasm has only widened at the Rio Olympics as the U.S. women have dominated and the U.S. men have faltered. Whereas the American women waltzed to victory in the team competition and appear poised to capture two more medals in the all-around Thursday, their male counterparts finished a distant fifth as a team and didn't sniff the medal stand in Wednesday's all-around.\n\n\"It's absolutely frustrating that it's not equal, but I think it's about winning,\" said U.S. Olympian Chris Brooks. \"The women have a wonderful track record of producing champions and medals over and over again. Companies want to be involved with champions and medal winners. If we're going to complain about it, we also have to do better.\"\n\nWhile more success on an Olympic stage would certainly narrow the popularity gap for the American men, sports marketers remain unconvinced it would close altogether. They're skeptical a gold medal-winning men's gymnast could ever attract the same caliber sponsorships or endorsements past female champions have.\n\nView photos Chris Brooks competes on the horizontal bar during the men's individual all-around. (Getty) More\n\nBy the morning after the all-around competition at the 2012 Olympics, champion Gabby Douglas had already gained 200,000 Twitter followers and received props from the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Lil Wayne and Nicki Minaj. Douglas would later grace cereal boxes and magazine covers, make the rounds on the talk show circuit and even star in her own reality TV series.\n\nBy contrast, American male gymnasts who win Olympic medals seldom become household names. Danell Leyva, the bronze medalist in the 2012 all-around competition, reportedly still lives at home with his mother and stepfather. Jonathan Horton, the top performer on the U.S. bronze-medal-winning team in 2008, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette two years ago that he receives 10 times more recognition for appearing on the show \"American Ninja Warrior\" than anything related to gymnastics.\n\n\"The women's combination of athleticism, youthfulness and feminism seems to grant them a broader demographic appeal in America,\" said Bob Dorfman, executive director of San Francisco-based Baker Street Advertising.\n\n\"Women admire and respect them, men love watching them, boys want to date them, young girls want to be them. And with the must-see Olympics attracting a wider audience than any other sporting event outside of the Super Bowl, it easily makes these athletes household names and faces, attracting a wide array of sponsors.\"\n\nThere are several factors that contributed to American female gymnasts overtaking their male counterparts in popularity during the 1970s.\n\n[Related: 'Brazilian boyfriend' of Simone Biles enjoys own time in Olympic spotlight]\n\nThe introduction of Title IX in 1972 created more opportunities for female gymnasts at the college level and began the gradual process of cash-strapped athletic departments axing their men's programs. A new generation of female gymnasts also began appearing about that same time, younger and more petite than their predecessors.\n\nWhen 14-year-old Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci won three gold medals in 1976 and became the first female to score a perfect 10, she quickly became the darling of that Olympics. Young girls identified with Comaneci's small stature, vibrant personality and remarkable athleticism. Parents began enrolling toddlers in tumbling classes and more gymnastics clubs began popping up nationwide to satisfy the growing demand.\n\nStory Continues"}
{"text": "(CNN) A British woman who says she was carrying painkillers for her ailing partner was sentenced Tuesday to three years in prison and fined the equivalent of $5,611 by an Egyptian court.\n\nLaura Plummer, 33, was arrested on October 9 at Hurghada International Airport on the Red Sea after police reportedly found 290 tablets of tramadol in her suitcase.\n\nPlummer, a shop assistant from Hull in east Yorkshire, was charged with drug possession and smuggling. Her lawyers argue the traveler misunderstood a question in court and gave a response that appeared to be a confession.\n\nWhile tramadol is legal in many countries as a prescription painkiller, it is illegal for a private individual to sell it in Egypt, where it is popular among lower-income sectors.\n\nPlummer said she had brought the drug to her Egyptian husband, Omar Abdel-Azim, who suffers from back pain.\n\nThe pair met five years ago in the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, when Abdel-Azim worked as a lifeguard.\n\nThey were married in 2014 through an unregistered contract, known in Egypt as an \"urfi\" marriage. Plummer has been visiting her husband regularly since.\n\nA look at the court case\n\nIn court, Plummer's lawyers argued the drug was not listed as illegal in the UK travel advisory.\n\nThe UK's decision to add a warning against carrying tramadol while traveling to Egypt was issued in November -- a month after the arrest.\n\n\"For someone to be found guilty of drug smuggling they have to be aware that they are possessing narcotics,\" Plummer's lawyer, Mohamed Othman, told Reuters.\n\n\"Laura did not know that what she was carrying was a narcotic. This is pursuant to that tramadol 50mg is a painkiller in her country, England. When she brought the tramadol, she believed it was a painkiller.\"\n\nOthman told CNN that the sentence was light, considering the charges.\n\nIn a statement, the British Foreign Office said it \"will continue to provide assistance to Laura and her family following the court ruling in Egypt, and our embassy is in regular contact with the Egyptian authorities.\"\n\nAn appeal is planned\n\nPlummer's trial started in the town of Safaga on Monday with what her lawyers described as a mistaken confession.\n\nTheir client was asked whether she was intending to sell the drug. But she thought she was asked whether she simply possessed it, and said yes, the lawyers said.\n\nThe defense also rejected allegations of smuggling and trading charges. \"She had only 320 pills. Even the plane ticket is almost double the price of those pills,\" Othman said. \"It is illogical that she will deal in tramadol.\"\n\nDrug smuggling convictions sometimes carry the death penalty; others carry a minimum of 10 years in prison. It wasn't immediately clear whether Plummer was convicted for possession, smuggling or both.\n\nPlummer plans to appeal the sentence.\n\n\"It will take a while and she has to go back to the prison,\" said Plummer's mother, Roberta Synclair.\n\n\"It's not fair,\" Synclair said. \"I was worried about her staying in the police custody; now she will be in the prison with criminal people.\"\n\n'Terrible mistake'\n\nPlummer's local MP, Karl Turner, said her case had been raised with British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt.\n\n\"I am hopeful that good sense will eventually prevail,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"This is a damning indictment actually of the Egyptian authorities, in the sense that good sense and fairness certainly hasn't prevailed in this case.\n\n\"This is a decent woman who has made a terrible mistake who shouldn't be incarcerated in any prison, never mind an Egyptian prison.\""}

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nArab foreign ministers on Sunday demanded that the United States rescind President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, calling it a \"grave\" development that puts Washington on the same side as \"occupation\" and the violation of international law.\n\nIn a resolution long on rhetoric but short on concrete actions, the ministers denounced what they claimed was an \"illegal\" and \"dangerous violation\" of international law. \"It's a dangerous development that places the United States at a position of bias in favor of the occupation and the violation of international law and resolutions,\" the resolution said.\n\nIt said it would seek a U.N. Security Council resolution rejecting the U.S. move.\n\nThe two-page resolution adopted by the emergency meeting, which began Saturday night, did not include any punitive actions against the United States, like a call for a boycott of American products or suspending or downgrading ties with Washington.\n\nIt also appeared to fall short of matching the anger felt by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, which have seen days of violent protests against Trump's decision.\n\nPhotos: Demonstrators protest Trump's controversial Jerusalem announcement\n\n\"We have taken a political decision not meant to reflect [what is going on in] the streets. Political work is responsible work,\" said Arab League chief Ahmed Aboul-Gheit. \"Jerusalem has been occupied for 50 years. This is an extended battle, a battle that will be escalated,\" he told the news conference.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Saturday he will not meet U.S. Vice President Mike Pence during Pence's visit to the region this month in a snub over the move.\n\nPence's spokeswoman, Alyssa Farah, responded Sunday saying it was \"unfortunate\" that Abbas declined to meet.\n\n\"The Palestinian Authority is walking away again from an opportunity to discuss the future of the region,\" she said. \"But the Administration remains undeterred in its efforts to help achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinian and our peace team remains hard at work putting together a plan.\"\n\nIsraeli air strikes killed two Palestinian gunmen on Saturday after militants fired rockets from the enclave into Israel on Friday, which had been declared a \"day of rage\" by Palestinian factions.\n\nMeanwhile violence erupted for a fourth day in response to Trump's announcement on Wednesday, which overturned decades of U.S. policy towards the Middle East.\n\nA Palestinian protester hurls stones at Israeli border guards during clashes near an Israeli checkpoint on December 9, 2017 in Ramallah, West Bank. Chris McGrath / Getty Images\n\nTrump's Dec. 6 announcement on Jerusalem, and his intention to move the U.S. Embassy there, triggered denunciations from around the world, with even close allies suggesting he had needlessly stirred more conflict in an already volatile region. Jerusalem's status lies at the core of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and Trump's move was widely perceived as siding with Israel. Even small crises over Jerusalem's status and that of the holy sites in its ancient Old City have sparked deadly bloodshed in the past.\n\nIsrael occupied and later annexed the eastern part of Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war, declaring the holy city its eternal capital. Palestinians want that part to be the capital of their future state.\n\nTrump's decision, according to the Arab resolution, stripped the U.S. of its role as a \"sponsor and broker\" in the Mideast peace process, and \"undermines efforts to bring about peace, deepens tension and will spark anger that will threaten to push the region to the edge of the abyss of violence, chaos and bloodshed.\"\n\nTrump's adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is leading efforts to restart peace negotiations, though his bid has shown little public progress so far."}

{"text": "Sorry, Mitt. But you're going to have to pay some taxes.\n\nWith President Obama busy spending much of his time trying to stop House Republicans from purposely destroying the economy in order to get the kind of cuts to Medicare they've spent years campaigning against, most of America has missed that we now have what some experts are calling the most progressive tax code since 1979.\n\nThe \"fiscal cliff\" deal raised taxes on the richest that come into effect just as new taxes to fund ObamaCare begin:\n\nThat deal includes a host of tax increases on the rich. It raises the tax rate to 39.6 percent from 35 percent on income above $400,000 for individuals, and $450,000 for couples. The rate on dividends and capital gains for those same taxpayers was bumped up 5 percentage points, to 20 percent. Congress also reinstated limits on the amount households with more than $300,000 in income can deduct. On top of that, two new surcharges — a 3.8 percent tax on investment income and a 0.9 percent tax on regular income — hit those same wealthy households.\n\nThese taxes are going to the people who can most afford them and have benefited the most even as millions are out of work. Basically, Mitt Romney will go from paying around a 9%-13% tax rate to something closer 20%. Will that stopping him from \"taking risks\" like sitting around and reaping massive gains from investments he made a decade ago? Not likely.\n\nAfter taxes went up on the rich in 1993, a massive economic boom followed. You can't say the tax increases caused the longest economic expansion in American history — though conservatives would surely crow if tax cuts led to such a boom — but it certainly didn't prevent it.\n\n65 years of shifting the tax burden from the rich to the middle class hasn't led to growth as promised, instead it's led to a massive accumulation of wealth by the richest 1%, according to report by the Congressional Research Service.\n\nThe results of the analysis in this report suggest that changes over the past 65 years in the top marginal tax rate and the top capital gains tax rate do not appear correlated with economic growth. The reduction in the top statutory tax rates appears to be uncorrelated with saving, investment, and productivity growth. The top tax rates appear to have little or no relation to the size of the economic pie. But as a small proportion of taxpayers are affected by changes in the top statutory tax rates, this finding is not unexpected. However, the top tax rate reductions appear to be correlated with the increasing concentration of income at the top of the income distribution. As measured by IRS data, the share of income accruing to the top 0.1% of U.S. families increased from 4.2% in 1945 to 12.3% by 2007 before falling to 9.2% due to the 2007-2009 recession. At the same time, the average tax rate paid by the top 0.1% fell from over 50% in 1945 to about 25% in 2009.\n\nWe've reversed this trend of ever increasing giveaways and we've done for a crazy reason: to make sure all Americans have access to life-saving healthcare.\n\nThere are imperfections in everything, which is why I oppose all purity tests except for food and drink. I keep wondering who will be the 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, for instance, who proposes saving $100 billion over the next decade by implementing a public option.\n\nThe Bush tax cuts were designed to break a budget that had been balanced to justify eventual cuts to government services. I still believe that. Thus we still have a structural deficit that will require extraordinary growth to fix, something the GOP will do whatever they can to prevent until they take the White House.\n\nBut let's not miss the big story here: Those who benefit the most are being asked to pay more to help making America a healthier fairer place. That sounds suspiciously like change I can believe in."}
{"text": "• A version of this post ran on the author's blog, thehavananote.com. The views expressed are the author's own.\n\nThe US embargo turned 50 years old this week. It probably won't surprise most folks to learn that the night before President John F. Kennedy signed a total US embargo of Cuba into force, he asked an aide to buy 1,000 Cuban cigars (just to be safe, the aide got 1,200).\n\nSurely Kennedy would have been shocked to learn that his massive stockpile would run out long before his embargo would; just days before his assassination, Kennedy had approved a secret meeting to take place in Havana between a senior US diplomat and Castro. But the meeting never took place, and Kennedy's embargo has remained a fixture now for half a century. Over at the Daily Mail, Lee Moran offers perspective on this week's milestone:\n\n\"When the embargo began, American teenagers were doing The Twist, the US had yet to put a man into orbit around the Earth and a first-class US postage stamp cost just 4 cents.\"\n\nHow is it that 10 presidents and a Cold War ago, the United States cut off nearly all trade, financial, and aid transactions with 11 million people 90 miles away? Never-ending presidentially declared sanctions such as Kennedy's Cuba embargo had a way of piling up in decades past, long past their utility or relevance. This eventually prompted Congress to reform the authority under which a president could use his emergency international economic (sanctions) powers. After that law passed in 1977, any new sanctions would require oversight and could not just continue in perpetuity. Except the Cuba embargo was grandfathered in with the new law, so, as long as the president declared, every year, the pressing national security interest in continuing it (or, rather, his authority to maintain it), the embargo hung on.\n\nPresident Obama last signed that declaration in September. But seriously, where's the emergency? Fifty years ago, in October 1962, the world came as close to nuclear war as it ever has, when the United States discovered nuclear-armed Soviet missiles in Cuba, initiated a naval blockade, and managed to negotiate an agreement with the Soviets for the missiles' withdrawal. That was clearly an emergency, and a definite threat to the United States.\n\nAnd 50 later? There's not exactly any national interest or emergency compelling the president (well, except for his own re-election fortunes in swing-state Florida) to continue this fossilized policy. If there were one, the just-released \"Worldwide Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community\" failed to mention it. The only threat in Cuba, according to the report, is the internet and its potential for undermining the Cuban government's grip on power.\n\nOn the contrary, our compelling interests surely lie in dismantling the embargo: it harms the Cuban people (and certainly doesn't help them at all), who would be quick to flood the US in the face of any real destabilization on the island. It invites Havana to embrace countries – Venezuela, Iran, China - that really do more materially threaten or at least challenge our interests. It locks us out of the incipient reform process in Cuba, and could also be hindering its progress as it offers Havana hardliners an easy excuse to maintain tight control. And, most directly counter to our national interest, the embargo hampers swift, routine, effective cooperation on shared interests with a willing partner, whether in fighting drug smuggling, human trafficking, or disaster prevention and mitigation.\n\n--- Anya Landau French blogs for The Havana Note, a project of the \"US-Cuba Policy Initiative,\" directed by Ms. Landau French, at the New America Foundation/American Strategy Program.\n\nFollow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.\n\n5 countries with the longest ongoing US sanctions\n\nGet daily or weekly updates from CSMonitor.com delivered to your inbox.

{"text": "Intro \"In his search for food, early man tried all kinds of plants. Some nourished him, some, he found cured his ills, and some killed him. Few, to his surprise, had strange effects on his mind and body, seeming to carry him onto other worlds. We call these plants hallucinogens, because they distort the senses and usually produce hallucinations--experiences that depart from reality. Although most hallucinations are visual, they may also involve the senses of hearing, touch, smell, or taste--and occasionally several senses simultaneously...\"\n\n1 Schultes, The compounds that we call \"hallucinogenic\" are drugs that modify the function of the central nervous system by altering the input from the senses and changing the mood and behavior of the individual. These short term effects have caused some concern among our parents and leaders, but it is the long term influence that we will consider here. \"In the history of mankind, hallucinogens have probably been the most important of all the narcotics. Their fantastic effects made them sacred to primitive man and may even have been responsible for suggesting to him the idea of deity.\"\n\n2 Schultes, Dr. Richard Evan Schultes was no drug crazed hippy, but a respected Harvard professor with impeccable credentials. It was apparent to Dr. Schultes that hallucinogens were deeply involved in early religions. He also understood that to broadcast such views could be hazardous to one's career. Hence he confined his revolutionary discovery to one line in a popular guide to plant identification rather than publishing in some academic journal. When etymologist John Allegro went public with his discoveries linking early Christianity to hallucinogenic mushrooms, his career was ruined. It is indeed a subject that can cause deep emotional reaction. That was one of the early tipoffs that something important was going on here. There were such extreme reactions to inquiries about mushrooms that researchers had to come up with terms to describe mushroom haters and lovers. Whole cultures can be categorized by their view as to whether certain mushrooms are considered food or poison. Besides religion, the study involves ritual cannibalism, sex, and behavior modification. All of this is dangerous territory and may cause strong emotional reactions in the reader. If you DO have an emotional reaction to any of this material, you should sit very still, breath deeply and try to relax. Try to identify your feelings. Are you feeling anger? Frustration? Fear? Hatred? If these feelings are strong, you may want to quit reading. But please don't be mad at me. I'm just telling it like I see it. A certain amount of denial is necessary for survival in these troubling times. In order to function we all need a solid emotional state from which to operate. Like it or not, our basic beliefs, our \"World View\", is a major component of said state. Messing with your core beliefs can be tricky business. It hurts. It can cause damage; but so can ignoring the Truth. The trick is to use denial to keep your peace of mind, being careful not to be crushed by the Truth when it lands on you. Our beliefs are what holds us together. When the leaders we trust turn out to be liars, thieves and murders, it can shake our confidence and certainly be painful. The feeling of betrayal can lead to nearly uncontrollable anger. When our Gods betray us, it may be too much for some people to bear. Some folks might be better off if they just pass on this material and stick to their beliefs. Proceed at your own risk. However, if you are a seeker, and serious about \"meaning of life\" issues, you can't afford to turn back now. <- About | Next -> Sources\n\n\nClick on Author to return to quoted text. 1 Schultes, Hallucinogenic Plants, Golden Press, New York, 1976, p 5.\n\n2 Schultes, Hallucinogenic Plants, Golden Press, New York, 1976, p 5."}

(AP) — Authorities on Wednesday identified two men and a woman found slain on an eastern Kansas farm and continued searching for the woman's 18-month-old daughter, who was last seen at the same property where the bodies were discovered.\n\nFranklin County Sheriff Jeffrey Richards said at a news conference Wednesday that law enforcement officials were questioning a person of interest they located in Emporia, about 50 miles southwest of the Ottawa farm where the bodies were found earlier this week. Richards said no charges had been filed in the case.\n\nHe said authorities also found a vehicle related to the investigation late Tuesday in Emporia, but would not say if the man they were questioning had been driving it.\n\nThe victims were identified as Kaylie Bailey, 21, of Olathe; Andrew A. Stout, 30, of Ottawa, and Steven E. White, 31, of Ottawa. Richards didn't say how the victims were killed.\n\nThe Kansas Bureau of Investigation said it is seeking the public's help in locating Bailey's 18-month-old daughter, Lana Leigh Bailey, who was reported missing with her mother on Friday. Richards said the mother and baby were both last seen at the Ottawa farm, but did not say when.\n\nThe first body was found in the farm's garage Monday by friends of Stout's, who had gone to check on his pets because they had not heard from him for several days. They called police after finding Bailey's body in the garage under a tarp.\n\nAuthorities then launched a full search with the help of several neighboring law enforcement agencies and found the other two bodies. Cadaver dogs were also brought in Tuesday to search the vast rural property, but no other bodies were found.\n\nKaylie Bailey's grandmother, Wilma Pettijohn, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview Wednesday that Kaylie and Lana Bailey lived with her and her husband, Andy Pettijohn, in Olathe. She said when authorities told the family Wednesday they had identified Kaylie Bailey's body, they also said they had no information about the missing baby.\n\n\"We don't know if the man who took the car took her with him or where she is now. ... But they didn't find Lana,\" Pettijohn said.\n\nShe said the family has been \"kind of preparing for the last day or two\" for the news that Kaylie Bailey was among the three killed at the farm. Friends of Bailey's have said she and Stout had a relationship and that on the day she disappeared, she had planned to drop her daughter off with Stout for the day.\n\nPettijohn described Lana as \"cheerful and playful, strong-minded\" and said the child's mother was a \"very sweet girl,\" though she could be \"somewhat naive maybe in the people she associated with sometimes.\"\n\n\"She liked for people around her to get along, not fuss or say hateful things,\" Pettijohn said of Bailey. \"Just really loving and caring that way. She thought the world of her baby. She loved her dearly.\"\n\nPettijohn said the family has a variety of nicknames for the missing baby, from \"sunshine\" to \"sweetheart or darling or lovely little adjectives.\" She said the family is hopeful the baby will be returned to them.\n\n\"Everything in the house reminds us of her,\" Pettijohn said. \"It's just a lot of pain between here and OK.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Bill Draper contributed to this report from Kansas City, Mo."}
{"text": "Rupert Murdoch has taken the rightwing US channel Fox News off the air in the UK after 15 years.\n\nHis US media group 21st Century Fox said it would withdraw Fox News from Sky in the UK on Tuesday because it no longer regarded the service as commercially viable.\n\n\nThe decision came as Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, is set to return her verdict on whether to ask the competition regulator to launch an investigation into the Murdochs' adherence to broadcasting standards in the UK as part of an inquiry into Fox's £11.7bn takeover bid for Sky.\n\n\nHowever, sources said the decision to stop broadcasting Fox News, which went off air at 4pm, was not connected to the takeover bid, arguing that the channel attracted only about 2,000 viewers a day in the UK.\n\n\n\"[Fox] has decided to cease providing a feed of Fox News Channel in the UK,\" a spokeswoman for the company said. \"Fox News is focused on the US market and designed for a US audience and, accordingly, it averages only a few thousand viewers across the day in the UK. We have concluded that it is not in our commercial interest to continue providing Fox News in the UK.\"\n\n\nFox News has become increasingly troublesome for the Murdochs as they attempt to buy Sky.\n\nThe channel is embroiled in a sexual harassment scandal that led to a string of high-profile figures leaving, including the chairman Roger Ailes, who has since died, and leading presenter Bill O'Reilly.\n\nIt has also been accused of colluding with Donald Trump's White House on a discredited story about a murdered Democrat activist, which critics of the Murdochs have compared to the News of the World hacking the phone of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler.\n\nOfcom, the UK media regulator, has also made a number of rulings against Fox News broadcasts in the last year, adding to the total of 22 breaches by Fox of its licence and Ofcom's codes and rules in the last decade. Of those, Fox News was responsible for seven, including four last year, one of them being a programme which featured a guest who said Birmingham was a city \"where non-Muslims just simply don't go\".\n\nTom Watson, the deputy Labour leader and shadow culture secretary, said the disappearance of Fox News from British screens should not affect the government's decision on whether 21st Century Fox should be allowed to buy Sky.\n\n\n\"Fox News has breached Ofcom's rules over and over again, so 21st Century Fox clearly thought it was easier to pull it from the UK altogether than to clean up its act,\" Watson said.\n\n\"But the ongoing corporate governance and sexual harassment scandal at Fox News is still deeply relevant to the question of whether 21st Century Fox should be allowed to take over Sky, whether the channel is broadcast here or not.\"\n\nFox News was taken off air between 5am and 11pm on election day to avoid any issues with Ofcom.\n\nUK fans of Fox News will not be able to turn to the internet to watch the channel as it is not streamed online. Only clips of Fox News programming are available online.\n\nSky, which is 39% controlled by 21st Century Fox, continues to fund Sky News, which loses tens of millions of pounds a year.\n\nEd Miliband, the former Labour leader and long-time Murdoch critic, said: \"This decision shows the Murdochs panicking about their bid for Sky. It amounts to an admission that despite having broadcast here year after year, Fox News is not fit for UK broadcasting in the standards and ethics of its journalism. It's yet more proof that the Murdochs can't be trusted to own 100% of Sky.\n\n\"Stopping broadcasting in the UK changes nothing. Fox News in the US is the Murdochs' channel, they are responsible for its broadcasting standards and the appalling racial and sexual harassment that happened on their watch. The Murdochs can't run from their record at Fox News.\""}
{"text": "HBO has decided to cancel in-house development of an upcoming streaming service that would allow viewers to watch the premium channel without a cable subscription.\n\nInstead, HBO will license third-party technology to power the service, according to an internal memo published by Fortune today. The decision appears to be a blow to HBO's CTO Otto Berkes, who brought on a number of his ex-colleagues from Microsoft to help form the HBO engineering office in Seattle.\n\nUPDATE: Berkes announced his resignation to staff today, according to Variety, which obtained a copy of the memo. In the note, he said the decision to outsource the service was not something he planned. \"Therefore, I feel that this is the right time for me to move on from HBO so that I am able to fully pursue my passion building world-class technology teams, products and businesses.\"\n\nAccording to sources, who spoke to Fortune anonymously, the office has been plagued by internal squabbles, leading to delayed product launches and service outages, like the ones suffered during the Game of Thrones and True Detective premiers. One source told Fortune that under Berkes' leadership, he had built a \"Napoleonic empire.\" Other reviews on Glassdoor paint an equally troubling culture, calling it \"toxic and lacking unity, direction and clarity.\"\n\n\"This decision was not made lightly, and was based on an assessment of risk and scope of the product needed to meet HBO¹s short term business needs for April 2015,\" according to the memo, which was sent by Mark Thomas, SVP of Technology Program Management, and Drew Angeloff, SVP, Digital Products, who is another Microsoft veteran who leads the Seattle office.\n\nFortune reports that the Seattle office — which at last count was expected to balloon to 100 people by year-end — costs an estimated $100 million a year to operate.\n\nIn October, HBO executives eagerly announced that the company was working on a streaming service that would allow viewers to watch its premium content without paying for a cable subscription. Until now, viewers have only been able to catch the latest episodes as long as they paid for it through their cable TV provider.\n\nThat announcement is likely driving part of today's decision to kill off the internal development project, code-named Maui. The company is increasingly under pressure to bolster its viewership despite a general trend to cut the cord.\n\nFortune also reported, citing unnamed sources, that HBO has signed a deal to use external technology from MLB Advanced, which already provides white-label streaming technology for clients like WWE Network.\n\nBerkes and an HBO spokesman did not immediately respond to a message from GeekWire seeking comment.\n\nIn the memo, Thomas and Angeloff claimed that the decision does not have to do with the product team working on Maui, and made no mention of any internal issues.\n\n\"This was not a judgment of the team's work quality or deliverables but rather a bet that an existing streaming service could deliver the needed product faster and at lower risk than Maui,\" the memo says. \"Drew and I have often discussed the excellent work done by the team on Maui – The Maui team was hitting deliverables ahead of schedule and at a high level of quality.\"\n\nWhile the future of the Seattle office is unknown, now that Maui has been canceled, for now it appears the jobs will remain intact, with the three core missions identified for the tech team going forward. According to the memo, they are: fully supporting the third-party technology in time for the April launch; reusing the technology built by the Maui team for the HBO Go app (which does require viewers to have a cable subscription); and identifying efforts around future interactive areas.\n\n\"Maui was a way to get us into market faster with a less than perfect solution — the external partner will take that burden allowing us to focus on the forward looking technologies we are creating for HBO GO.\""}
{"text": "Google\n\nDo you own a Motorola phone and wonder why some of your counterparts have Lollipop and you don't? Motorola is attempting to shed some light on the situation.\n\nIn a blog post on Thursday, the company announced that Android 5.0 Lollipop is now available for the Moto G (first and second generations) in India and Brazil. That's good news for Moto users in those countries. But Motorola actually kicked off its Lollipop push last November, shortly after Google officially released updated OS. Why is it taking so long to fan out?\n\nGoogle's mobile OS is cursed by fragmentation as each new version takes considerable time to arrive on the phones and tablets of all Android users worldwide. A peek at Google's Android Developers Dashboard earlier this month revealed a 39 percent share of the market for KitKat -- the predecessor to Lollipop. Jelly Bean -- the predecessor to KitKit -- was still at the top of the charts with a 46 percent share. And Lollipop wasn't even on the radar yet, meaning it had less than a 0.1 percent share. This situation frustrates not only users but app developers, who must try to design programs that can support multiple versions of Android.\n\nIn its blog, Motorola explained the process involved in an Android upgrade and why it takes so long.\n\nAfter Google creates a new version of its mobile OS, Google performs a \"public push,\" Motorola said. That means the source code for the OS is released to the Android Open Source Project, usually tied to the debut of a new Google Nexus flagship phone.\n\nFollowing the public push, mobile phone makers then test the new OS with local carriers and other organizations, a process that varies with each region of the world. After completing that testing, Motorola can start pushing out the upgrade to users.\n\nOkay, but why do some users receive the upgrade early and others have to wait weeks or months?\n\nMotorola said that before it can roll out an upgrade to a wide number of users, it performs \"soak\" tests. Through such tests, the upgrade is deployed to a small group of people so Motorola can monitor its performance and collect user feedback. Such testing is critical because it can reveal any bugs in the software, giving the company a chance to fix them before the upgrade reaches a wider audience.\n\nIn some cases, Motorola expands the number of soak test users to catch issues that might pop up in a larger group. After this test is done, the company launches the upgrade for all users in a specific country and for a specific device.\n\nTo add to the complexity, testing may be required for different software versions for each device, which further impacts the availability of a new upgrade, both by region and carrier. Finally, mobile carriers get into the act through their own testing to make sure the upgrade meets their requirements.\n\n\"These requirements vary from carrier to carrier and across different regions.\" Motorola said. \"They also have lab testing times that can range from weeks to months. In some cases, devices on older or less powerful chipsets may need more work to ensure good performance when running Lollipop.\"\n\nMotorola did say that Google improved the Android upgrade process with Lollipop by releasing developer previews early enough so manufacturers had more time to test the software. As such, Motorola was able to push Lollipop to its Moto X (second generation) Pure Edition eight days after Google's public push.\n\nAnd the rollout continues. Last week, Motorola said that Android 5.0 would be to its Moto G (second generation) phone in the United States. Motorola users who haven't yet gotten a taste of Lollipop can check the company's Upgrades page to see if and when your model is slated to receive the upgrade.\n\nWith so many manufacturers, carriers, and devices involved, upgrading all Android devices with the latest version is always going to be a long, time-consuming process. Android users, you have two choices: be patient or switch to Apple's iPhone."}
{"text": "Submitted by Martin Armstrong via ArmstrongEconomics.com,\n\nSpain has shown that it is fully on board with the Brussels authoritarian direction of ending democracy. Those in power have simply convinced themselves that the people do not understand what is good for them so they must impose their will upon the people but raw force. How does this differ in any what from the justification of imposing communism? This is the death of all freedom and it is upon our doorstep.\n\nHere are the new laws in Spain:\n\n1. If you photograph security personnel and then share these images on social media: up to €30.000 fine (particularly if photo exposes violence used against a member of the public). This fine could increase depending on the number of Instagram or social media followers you have.\n\n2. Tweet or retweet information or the \"location of an organized protest\" can now be interpreted as an act of terrorism as it incites others to \"commit a crime\" (now that \"demonstrating\" in many ways has become a crime). Sound \"1984\"-ish? Read about Orwell and his time in Spain.\n\n3. Snowden-like whistle blowing is now defined as an act of terrorism. If you write for a local publication, be careful what you print, whom you speak to, and whether the government is listening.\n\n4. Visiting or consulting terrorist websites – even for investigative purposes – can be interpreted as an act of terrorism. Make sure you use \"Tor\" browser, reject cookies, and don't allow pop-ups. Not to mention, don't post it on your Facebook timeline!\n\n5. Be careful with the royal jokes! Any satirical comment against the royal family is a new crime \"against the Crown\". For example, \"What did Leticia and the Bishop have to say after they ––\" (SORRY CENSORED).\n\n6. No more hassling elected members of the government or local authorities – even if they say one thing in order to be elected, but then go and do the exact opposite. Confronting them about this hypocritical behavior. Even if you see them in the street chatting to a street cleaner, dining at their favorite expensive restaurant, or having their shoes shined by that physics graduate who cannot find a decent job in the country, hassling them about their behavior is now a criminal offence.\n\n7. Has your local river been so polluted by that plastic factory along the edge that all life has extinguished? Well, tough! Greenpeace or similar protests are now finable from €601–€30.000.\n\n8. Protests in a spontaneous way outside Parliament are now illegal. For example if Parliament passes a hugely unpopular bill, or are debating something extremely important to you or your community, it is now finable from €601 – €30.000. Tip: Use Google Maps to protest just around the corner – but don't tweet the location!\n\n9. Obstructing an officer in the course of their business, \"resisting arrest\", refusing to leave a demonstration when told, or getting in the way of a swinging baton are all now finable offences from €601 – €30.000.\n\n10. Showing lack of respect to officers of the law is an immediate fine of €100 – €600. Answering back, asking a disrespectful question, making a funny face, showing your bottom to an officer of the law, or telling him/her that their breath reminds you of your dog's underparts is now, sadly, not advisable.\n\n11. Occupying, squatting, or refusing to leave an office, business, bank or other place until your complaint has been heard as a protest is now a €100 – €600 fine (no more flash mobs).\n\n12. Digital protests: Writing something that could technically \"disturb the peace\" is a now a crime. Bloggers beware, for no one has yet defined whose peace you could be disturbing."}
{"text": "There are well over half-a-million licensed Certified Public Accountants in the US according to a recent study performed by the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy. This is roughly the population of El Paso, TX!\n\nThis data was assembled from NASBA's interstate database that holds records from all 55 state boards and licensing authorities except four: Hawaii, Wisconsin, Utah, and Delaware. These four states have approved the interstate information sharing process, but have yet to be implemented into the system.\n\nHow Many CPAs are in the US?\n\nI know what you are thinking. If this is the total of all CPA licenses in all states, won't it be double counting the CPAs who are licensed in multiple states? Great question, but they already thought about that and made sure not to double count individual licensed in more than one state.\n\nThis 2016 figure is up since the 2006 data that showed 646,520 licensed and active CPAs in the United States. This increase is a good sign for the profession and a good sign for the financial industry overall, but it is not that impressive.\n\nWhat Does This Trend Mean?\n\nGenerally, the growing trend of people becoming CPAs and entering in the profession would be a good thing, and it is. But, the growth has become stagnant over the last few years, only growing at a rate of 1 percent. This isn't a large boom by any means.\n\nActually, if you look back to the 1990s, the total number of first time CPA candidates in the US has declined about 20 percent. This means less people are taking the exam each year as compared with prior years.\n\nIn other words, people are becoming CPAs at a lessor rate than in previous decades. It's unclear as to what is causing this decrease in people becoming certified, but it is clear that several things in the certification process have changed since the 1990s.\n\nFor example, most states now require additional work experience requirements and 150 college credit hours to become licensed. These increased requirements most likely have contributed to this decline.\n\nPlus, there are many other career options available than in the 1990s. For example, computer science engineers and programmers were not nearly as big as they are today. These careers might be pulling potential future CPAs away from the profession.\n\nKeep in mind that just because the rate of people becoming a CPA for the first time is slowing down, it doesn't mean that accounting jobs are going anywhere.\n\nHow Many Accountants are CPAs?\n\nAccounting jobs in the US and internationally keep increasing year over year according to the US Bureau of Labor and Statistics.\n\nThere are roughly 1.3M accountants in the US and only about 650,000 CPAs. Thus, approximately 50 percent of all accountants are licensed CPAs.\n\nNo Better Time to Become a CPA\n\nThere's no better time to become a CPA than right now. The worldwide demand for certified public accountants is at an all time high. The overall growth might be slowly slightly, but the total demand is still growing.\n\nThe US Bureau of Labor and Statistics estimates that the demand for accountants will increase upwards of 10 percent in the next 5 years. With all of the new government regulations from healthcare to retirement savings, there is no question that number will be even higher. Business Insider reported that accountants will be the number 1 demanded career over the next 10 years.\n\nCPAs are not only needed domestically, they are needed internationally too. Candidates from more than 100 countries around the world are taking the CPA exam, so they can prepare SEC filings for international companies among other things.\n\nIf you aren't a CPA yet, you should serious consider joining the profession. But before you can become one, you will have to pass the CPA exam. Here are the most helpful study courses that candidates have used to pass the exam. Check them out."}
{"text": "Broncos head coach Vance Joseph has a clear plan in place for how he intends to use his quarterbacks and starters in Thursday's preseason opener at Chicago.\n\nThe starting defense, including pass rusher Von Miller, will play a maximum of three series to begin the game.\n\n\"It depends on how it goes,\" Joseph said. \"If they go out there and play a dominant series, they may play one. If they have a so-so series in the first and a better series in the second series, they'll only play two. But three max.\"\n\nOn offense, Trevor Siemian was named the starting quarterback vs. the Bears; Paxton Lynch was named the starter for the second preseason game against San Francisco. Each quarterback, Joseph said, will play about a quarter and a half.\n\nStarting running back C.J. Anderson will follow the script of the defense and play a maximum of three series. Veteran Stevan Ridley, rookie De'Angelo Henderson and Juwan Thompson will finish out the game. Veteran Jamaal Charles, who took more reps in practice Tuesday as the team moved back outside, will not play in Chicago.\n\n\"We want to stay with the plan for Jamaal and just give him more and more reps as we go along,\" Joseph said. \"Being inside (Monday), we didn't want him on the turf that much with his history. Back on the grass, we gave him more reps.\"\n\nThe starting offensive line Thursday will consist of Garett Bolles at left tackle, Max Garcia at left guard, Connor McGovern at center, Ron Leary at right guard and Menelik Watson at right tackle. Matt Paradis, still easing his way back from two hip surgeries earlier this year, will not play.\n\nInjury updates\n\nJoseph said inside linebacker Todd Davis will not play in Thursday's preseason game because of the shoulder sprain that has kept him out of practices. Davis did not workout with the team Tuesday morning and Joseph said his availability in preseason could be limited because of the injury.\n\n\"His timeline, it's day-to-day,\" Joseph said. \"It's more precautionary for Todd than a concern.\"\n\nCorey Nelson will start with Davis sidelined.\n\n\"Corey is on the lines of (cornerback Bradley) Roby,\" Joseph said. \"He's our third inside linebacker, our starting dime player. So, in my opinion, Corey is a starter. On most teams, Corey would be a starter. If he had to play for us, I would have no problem with Corey being the (regular-season) starter for us.\"\n\nAs for other injured or recovering players, running back Bernard Pierce (hamstring) did not practice Tuesday and safety T.J. Ward (hamstring) observed from the sideline. Joseph said Monday that Ward will not play Thursday.\n\nEmergency plan\n\nThe Broncos opened Tuesday's practice by working on their contingency plans on special teams.\n\nDefensive end Billy Winn stepped in as the emergency long snapper, Siemian took over for Riley Dixon as the emergency holder, and then Dixon dropped back as kicker. On punts, kicker Brandon McManus filled the emergency slot. McManus served as placekicker and punter and handled kickoffs while in college at Temple.\n\nFootnotes\n\nAccording to ESPN, quarterback Mike Glennon is expected to start Thursday's game in Chicago and will likely play a series or two. Mark Sanchez, a familiar face in Denver after last year's quarterback competition, and rookie Mitchell Trubisky will play the remainder of the game. … Special teams coordinator Brock Olivo was asked if Miller could seriously return punts. \"We could probably put Von back there alone,\" he said jokingly. \"I don't think there's anything Von Miller can't do. He's a great dancer, too.\" … Joseph said offensive coordinator Mike McCoy and defensive coordinator Joe Woods will wear headsets on the sideline."}

You don't have to worry about the -4 from a goal, but you can still rack up bonus points, goals, and assists. They really can be the whole package, if you are able to pick the right ones. This was a particularly hard week for us to decide on midfielders, but we managed to decide on a few.\n\nBig 3\n\nMike Magee (TOR v LA), Graham Zusi (MON vs SKC), and Sebastien Le Toux (NY vs PHI).\n\nKeep reading for the rest.\n\nPatrice Bernier (Montreal) vs Kansas City\n\nPrice: $8.0m\n\nOwned by: 14.9%\n\nBernier could easily make out list on the Big 4, but I feel like he needs to be included. As I've been saying all week, Montreal is in excellent form and that's hard to ignore. Bernier is also on excellent personal form getting a goal and an assist over the last 2 games. Bernier also has an excellent number of recoveries (second most of any midfielder), which will continue to be a good source of bonus points for any manager who has him. If you have the funds, Bernier could be your guy. If you don't have the cash, but still want Montreal coverage, Arnaud is a slightly cheaper option, but Bernier does look better….and he takes PKs.\n\nDiego Valeri (Portland) vs Colorado\n\nPrice: $8.0m\n\nOwned by: 10.7%\n\nHere's another player who has a lower ownership that I would expect, though he was quite during his last two games. Valeri is a big playmaker that likes to go on the attack for Portland and Colorado is having a rough start. These are positives for the Timbers' when they are playing away at Colorado. Perhaps the Rapids will be hoping for some more snow like hit the field last week. Perhaps he's a bit expensive, but he could be worth it.\n\nEdgar Mejia (Chivas) vs Vancouver\n\nPrice: $7.0m\n\nOwned by: 2.1%\n\nOn the slightly cheaper side, and I can't believe I'm saying this… we have Mejia. Chivas is doing much better than most people thought they would at this point and Mejia is in good form. He grabbed a goal and an assist last week, which brings his total assists to 2 and goals to 1. He's an attacking player, so you will not expect many defensive bonus points from him. But when he gets a chance to make good crosses and passes, he's really able to make them count. They are playing Vancouver at home this week, and te extra fan support could be just what they need to help earn them another win.\n\nDifferential\n\nRicardo Clark (Houston) vs San Jose\n\nPrice: $7.0m\n\nOwned by: 5.1%\n\nHis ownership is not lower than Mejia's, but with the return of Brad Davis (who did not play a lot on International duty), he may not be getting quite as many looks. That's the reason he's listed as the differential. That aside, He has a goal and an assist to his name, has OK recovery numbers, and is currently the top point getter for Houston. He's also a lot cheaper than Davis. Perhaps it will pay off, or maybe you'll just splurge on Davis.\n\nThese are my picks, if you think there should be more names on this list, please leave a comment or come to r/FantasyMLS and comment on the post. You can also leave a message on our Facebook page. Keep checking back for more updates through the week for other positions.\n\nAdvertisements"}

Once released from prison, he joined a D.C.-area think tank focused on studying extremism, saying he hoped to \"make amends\" through his work.\n\nBut Morton, now 38, again faces legal troubles after being arrested and accused of bringing cocaine to meet a prostitute. He is due in court next week and could return to prison.\n\nMorton is no longer working as a research fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, a spokesman confirmed.\n\nMorton was once deemed by federal prosecutors as dangerous to \"the very freedoms on which our society is based.\" But even before leaving prison, he has said in an interview, he began working undercover on counterterrorism operations. He was released in 2015 after serving less than a third of his 11½ -year prison sentence and hired by GWU the following year.\n\nAccording to court documents, Morton was arrested on Dec. 28 in a sting operation by Fairfax police. He answered an ad on Backpage.com for a prostitute, police said. When he showed up at the Governor House Inn & Suites in Falls Church, he was arrested. Police say they found cocaine and a glass pipe in his pack of Marlboro cigarettes. In his car, they said they found another device for smoking crack cocaine. He is charged with possession with manufacturing a controlled substance and residing in a bawdy place.\n\n[The feds billed him as a threat to American freedom. Now they're paying him for help.]\n\nMorton could not be reached for comment, and his lawyer did not return a request for comment. He is scheduled to appear in federal court in Alexandria on Tuesday and in Fairfax County court on April 19.\n\nMorton's violent exhortations on the Revolution Muslim website were blamed for inspiring Colleen LaRose, who tried to kill a Swedish cartoonist, and Jose Pimentel, who plotted a New York City bombing, among others. Morton pleaded guilty in 2012 to conspiring to solicit murder, making threatening communications and using the Internet to place others in fear.\n\nIn an interview last fall with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Morton said that after his plea and while in prison, he began doing work for federal agents. According to court documents and a defense attorney involved, after his release Morton was paid by the FBI to help build a case against a supporter of the Islamic State.\n\n[George Washington University hires a former al-Qaeda recruiter]\n\nThe FBI also relied on Morton to help demystify the radicalization process, and he took on a similar role at GWU.\n\nIn a 2016 interview with The Washington Post, Morton said he hoped that work would give him \"a bit of an ability to make amends.\"\n\nHe explained how what he described as a traumatic childhood and substance abuse issues left him alienated, searching for a personal transformation and a countercultural worldview. He said he found it first by reading \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" during a brief jail stint at age 20. During a second incarceration, Morton converted to Islam.\n\nA fellow prisoner told him a war was coming between Muslims and non-Muslims, and he took up that cause, he told CSIS, fusing extremist politics to his new religious fervor. After his release, even as he graduated from Metropolitan College of New York and earned a master's degree in international affairs from Columbia University in 2008, Morton associated with violent ideologues and became one himself.\n\nBefore his arrest in the federal case, Morton told CSIS, he had begun questioning his views. The way he was treated by agents, he said, made him start to see the good in the U.S. justice system."}

The Great Eye is the manifestation of Sauron (also referred to as the Eye of Sauron), the big baddie in the British writer's Lord of the Rings books, and the kingdom he rules is Mordor.\n\nYou might remember the Eye of Sauron from Peter Jackson's award-winning film adaptations of Tolkein's books:\n\n\nNowadays, going online to draw comparisons between Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump and a malevolent personification of pure evil bent on oppressing the masses has become an almost-unconscious reflex reaction, much like saying, \"Bless you,\" after someone sneezes. You don't think about saying it, it just comes out of your mouth automatically.\n\nThat's why, much like the sunset in the original photo, it was inevitable that the photographer would post a doctored, Sauron-centric version:\n\n\nOther individuals followed different muses when it came to expressing themselves in the post's comments thread after being inspired by the picture. User professorpan channeled Tolkien and waxed poetic, reworking a famous passage from The Fellowship of the Ring:\n\n\"Thither, westwards, Uncle Sam's eye was drawn. It passed the ruined bridges of Brooklyn, the grinning gates of Appalachia and the haunted Mountains, and it looked upon Dixie, the valley of terror in the Land of Red States. Darkness lay there under the Sun. Fire glowed amid the smoke. Mount Donald was burning, and a great reek rising. Then at last his gaze was held: wall upon wall, battlement upon battlement, silver tower of adamant, he saw it: Barad-dôn, Fortress of Trump. All hope left him.\"\n\nAnother user, dexterpine, channeled Trump himself to give a glimpse of how the real estate mogul-cum-unscripted TV host-cum-professional attention-seeker-cum-presidential candidate would view the photo:\n\n\"Let me tell you, folks, this tower is so magnificent. People mistake it for the sun. It's really tremendous. And look, I had this guy design it for me and Dubai was so impressed with it they had him design a tower for them too. The Muslims love me. And I got a great deal on the building too. I love making deals. I'm really great at it. And when they were showing me the final sketches, I said we need to make the tower 10 feet taller. And we did. Look, I get things done.\"\n\nTwo other commenters, however, were a bit more apocalyptic in their assessments:\n\n\"I guess I have been watching to many disaster movies,\" wrote user BaronElectricPhase. \"First glance had me thinking it was the very beginning of a nuke blast.\"\n\n\n\"That's God trying to burn Trump Tower down,\" added user bigoldgeek.\n\nPHOTOS: Chicago's Trump Tower during sunset in April/May 2016.

Breathless accounts of a new crime wave have appeared in both liberal and conservative media. Right-wing pundits and some police leaders have claimed that there is a \"Ferguson effect\"—a significant crime increase due to the \"Black Lives Matter\" protests against police violence. This is both junk science and political opportunism. Ad Policy The \"Ferguson Effect\" is both junk science and political opportunism.\n\nThe New York Times recently reported that a couple dozen US cities have experienced increases in murders, and a few others some increase in other violent crimes. While any uptick in serious crime should be of concern, short-term changes in a few crime categories is thin evidence of a sustained national trend. In fact, in most parts of the country, crime in general, and murder rates in particular, continue to go down. While New York City, one site of ongoing protest, had a spike in homicides in the early part of the year, the city just completed the \"safest summer in 25 years\" according to Commissioner Bill Bratton. In addition, a new report by the Sentencing Project shows that in St. Louis, the uptick in homicides actually was well underway before the death of Michael Brown.\n\nEven in cities that have experienced some increase in homicides, there has been no increase in other crimes. Why would a reduction in policing (as claimed by proponents of the \"Ferguson effect\") result in more homicides but fewer robberies, burglaries, and auto thefts? The fact is that while homicide numbers are considered very accurate, they are such rare occurrences that it is very dangerous to draw any conclusions about broader crime trends from limited periods of time. Six months of homicide data is not enough to predict what year-end numbers will look like, and it's bad journalism and worse science to do so.\n\nFor the last 20 years, police leaders and their supporters have claimed near-total credit for the dramatic drop in crime beginning in the 1990s, even though different police departments have supported very different and at times contradictory methods. Now that there is some evidence of a crime increase in their jurisdiction, their fingers are suddenly pointing elsewhere. The right-wing echo chamber is abuzz with attacks on the movement against police misconduct, from slandering individual activists to blaming a host of social ills on them, while at the same time denying that they have any influence or relevance. The uptick in homicides in St. Louis was well underway before the death of Michael Brown."}
{"text": "Donald Trump thinks NFL players who kneel during the national anthem are \"disrespecting\" the flag. He also thinks they're \"disrespecting\" America's armed forces. And most importantly – for him anyway – he thinks they're \"disrespecting\" Donald Trump.\n\nLet's just be clear: none of that is true. Taking the knee was a gesture to protest police brutality. Just ask Eric Reid, who quite literally started the whole movement alongside then-teammate Colin Kaepernick. \"It baffles me that our protest is still being misconstrued as disrespectful to the country, flag and military personnel, Reid wrote, in a recent Op-Ed for The New York Times, adding that he and Kaepernick \"chose it because it's exactly the opposite.\"\n\nSee as it turns out, Reid and Kaepernick actually consulted with Nate Boyer, a retired Green Beret and former N.F.L. player about the protests. Of course Trump won't tell you that part. Here's the actual picture Boyer posted on Twitter after that consultation:\n\nThanks for the invite brother… Good talk. Let's just keep moving forward. This is what America should be all about pic.twitter.com/LgjPpjk173 — Nate Boyer (@NateBoyer37) September 2, 2016\n\nAnd here's the quote from Boyer:\n\nWe sorta came to a middle ground where he would take a knee alongside his teammate. Soldiers take a knee in front of a fallen brother's grave, you know, to show respect.\n\nAdditionally, this was never about Trump. It started before Trump was President. Trump made it about Trump. He practically branded the whole thing like he would one of his buildings. Then, in the final insult to America, he staged a $250,000 publicity stunt (paid for by taxpayers) involving Mike Pence and then turned around less than 24 hours later and used that same publicity stunt to fleece those same taxpayers out of $5 more dollars.\n\nTrump has tweeted the word \"respect\" about two dozen times over the past several weeks. Here's the list:\n\nNote that every one of those tweets is about the NFL except three. Of those three exceptions, two are about Las Vegas and the other one is about a book someone wrote about him.\n\nOk, so on Wednesday night, we got a glimpse at how little Trump actually knows about \"respecting\" the flag and soldiers. Watch this clip:\n\n\"Are they playing that for you or for me?,\" he asks Sean Hannity (as if anyone other than the people in charge of playing dramatic lead-ins for Fox News would ever play a song for Sean Hannity).\n\nWell as it turns out, they weren't playing that for Trump or Hannity. Because that's \"Retreat,\" part of \"Reveille, retreat and taps.\" Here's how this works:\n\nReveille is played as a bugle call to signal the beginning of the duty day on base. Retreat is played to mark the end of the duty day. Taps is played to mark the start of quiet hours on base, which is 9 p.m.a military tradition that dates prior to the Revolutionary War.\n\nBut wait, you haven't even heard the punchline. Here's the official protocol for \"Retreat\":\n\nAt the first sound of the retreat bugle call, all personnel outdoors should stop and face the flag, or when not visible, in the direction the music is played. If in uniform, protocol is to stand at parade rest. If not wearing a uniform or a civilian, protocol is to stop and face the flag or music only.\n\nRight. \"protocol\" for those who want to show \"respect\" for the flag and the military \"is to stop and face the flag.\"\n\nOr to suggest it's being played in honor of Sean Hannity's ratings. Either or.\n\n************************"}
{"text": "How to Get a Show on HBO\n\nAudiences aren't often given a behind-the-scenes peek at the executive minds of HBO, but that's exactly what attendees at the Jacob Krueger Studio got with the \"First Fridays\" Q&A event June 3 with guest Alex Fumero, HBO's new vice president of programming. Co-hosted and moderated by iTVFest and Executive Director Philip Gilpin, and put on in partnership with Akyumen Technologies, this evening with HBO filled to capacity with screenwriters, actors, and other creatives eager for insight on navigating the industry.\n\nThroughout the two-hour event, Fumero emphasized the importance of having a distinct story and voice when selling a product, which often calls for well-rounded, multi-hyphenate creators.\n\n\"The reality is that things are moving more in the direction of creators rather than simply, 'I'm a writer,' or, 'I'm an actor.' \" Fumero said. \"When I was in college, I went to theater school, and we were told that the only way you could make it in the theater is by making your own work. That was true in the theater then, and I think that's very true in television now.\"\n\nThese sorts of talents exist all over the web series and indie circuit (a well that Fumero was specifically brought on to tap), but looking to his network, he cited \"Girls\" creator and star Lena Dunham. While he quickly clarified that not all exciting new work needs to be semi-autobiographical, he said young creators are best honing in on whatever they're passionate about. Have a vision, have an opinion, and make the way you view the world known—even if you have to be pushy about it.\n\n\"That's the thing, working with creatives: I would almost rather work with someone who is somewhat challenging to work with because they're so opinionated than work with someone who's very nice but is sort of, like, 'What do you want?' \" he said. \"Art is violence—you gotta make that choice.\"\n\nWith those parameters in mind, it's then just a matter of getting your work in Fumero and his colleagues' hands. Fumero believes agent representation or independent festivals and incubators like iTVFest (for which HBO is a sponsor) will get you and your work seen by the right people.\n\nREAD: What To Do Before You Get An Agent\n\n\"I think you need to find platforms that allow you to showcase your work so that people like agents or production companies that are more established, or managers, or incubators can view your work and partner with you and help you on the business side of it to reach people like me. That's the realistic model,\" Fumero said. \"I wouldn't have the bandwidth to suss through the volume of ideas if it weren't for these kind of focus filters.\"\n\nFrom there, when Fumero is presented a prospective project from an agent, he asks himself three questions: Do I like this? Do we have something like this? And is it the same as anything else that's out there? HBO has always been a network that prizes its creators and talents—or as Fumero put it, \"breeds a culture of creative first.\" But in the early development stages, executives first and foremost go with their gut.\n\n\"More than anywhere else, [HBO is] definitely a know-it-when-I-see-it type of company,\" he said. \"It's really about finding specific voices, or familiar voices that are doing something new.... I wouldn't say there's anything in particular...other than whatever it is that you [bring]. I don't think you can reverse engineer it.\"\n\nInspired by this post?

{"text": "A new study from the University of Cambridge has identified one of the oldest fossil brains ever discovered – more than 500 million years old – and used it to help determine how heads first evolved in early animals. The results, published today (7 May) in the journal Current Biology, identify a key point in the evolutionary transition from soft to hard bodies in early ancestors of arthropods, the group that contains modern insects, crustaceans and spiders.\n\nThe study looked at two types of arthropod ancestors – a soft-bodied trilobite and a bizarre creature resembling a submarine. It found that a hard plate, called the anterior sclerite, and eye-like features at the front of their bodies were connected through nerve traces originating from the front part of the brain, which corresponds with how vision is controlled in modern arthropods.\n\nThe new results also allowed new comparisons with anomalocaridids, a group of large swimming predators of the period, and found key similarities between the anterior sclerite and a plate on the top of the anomalocaridid head, suggesting that they had a common origin. Although it is widely agreed that anomalocaridids are early arthropod ancestors, their bodies are actually quite different. Thanks to the preserved brains in these fossils, it is now possible to recognise the anterior sclerite as a bridge between the head of anomalocaridids and that of more familiar jointed arthropods.\n\n\"The anterior sclerite has been lost in modern arthropods, as it most likely fused with other parts of the head during the evolutionary history of the group,\" said Dr Javier Ortega-Hernández, a postdoctoral researcher from Cambridge's Department of Earth Sciences, who authored the study. \"What we're seeing in these fossils is one of the major transitional steps between soft-bodied worm-like creatures and arthropods with hard exoskeletons and jointed limbs – this is a period of crucial transformation.\"\n\nOrtega-Hernández observed that bright spots at the front of the bodies, which are in fact simple photoreceptors, are embedded into the anterior sclerite. The photoreceptors are connected to the front part of the fossilised brain, very much like the arrangement in modern arthropods. In all likelihood these ancient brains processed information like in today's arthropods, and were crucial for interacting with the environment, detecting food, and escaping from predators.\n\nDuring the Cambrian Explosion, a period of rapid evolutionary innovation about 500 million years ago when most major animal groups emerge in the fossil record, arthropods with hard exoskeletons and jointed limbs first started to appear. Prior to this period, most animal life on Earth consisted of enigmatic soft-bodied creatures that resembled algae or jellyfish.\n\nThese fossils, from the collections of the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, originated from the Burgess Shale in Western Canada, one of the world's richest source of fossils from the period.\n\nSince brains and other soft tissues are essentially made of fatty-like substances, finding them as fossils is extremely rare, which makes understanding their evolutionary history difficult. Even in the Burgess Shale, one of the rare places on Earth where conditions are just right to enable exceptionally good preservation of Cambrian fossils, finding fossilised brain tissue is very uncommon. In fact, this is the most complete brain found in a fossil from the Burgess Shale, as earlier results have been less conclusive.\n\n\"Heads have become more complex over time,\" said Ortega-Hernández, who is a Fellow of Emmanuel College. \"But what we're seeing here is an answer to the question of how arthropods changed their bodies from soft to hard. It gives us an improved understanding of the origins and complex evolutionary history of this highly successful group.\"\n\nThe research is supported by Emmanuel College, Cambridge."}
{"text": "Victorinox Pioneer Swiss Army Pocket Knife Review\n\nFounded in 1884, Victorinox is a knife manufacturer out of Switzerland that is the sole supplier of multi-purpose knives to the Swiss army. Which is what most of us know them from, Swiss Army Knives. It is definitely what I know them from, having been issued a Victorinox pocket knife when I started my tour of duty with the Royal Dutch Military Police, some time ago now.\n\nAnd let me tell you, that little Victorinox knife served me well. Especially when guarding some completely deserted cross road in the middle of a forest, fighting blazing colds, waiting day and night for that one moment when a tank commander decided to have his battle tanks cross the street. We than needed to make sure no civilians were crushed by them. Being a corporal I was the highest ranking guy out there most of the time, which gave a little wiggle room. So at one point we decided that it would be a good idea to bring a small stove with us, a few cans of sausages and make the best of it. And we did.\n\nThis pocket knife review is about the tool that helped make that happen, the Victorinox Pioneer. It is a compact multi-tool for hiking, camping, or around-the-house use, and apparently also stuck-in-a-forest-MP's . The build quality is every bit as good as you might expect from a Swiss knife. Victorinox is so convinced of its build quality that they give a lifetime warranty.\n\nThe Pioneer is enclosed in a stylish ribbed silver Alox housing that provides a good deal of grip. It measures 3.5 inches overall and weighs a mere 3.2 ounces. The blade is nice and big for a pocket knife as it comes in at 2.5 inches. Its very sharp out of the box, ready to be used.\n\nGoing over the tools you'll find a very effective can opener. Don't be fooled, this little thing will open about any can regular with ease. To proof that I opened a can of Tuna Fish, which took me just 59 seconds and really no effort at all. Check out this amazing feat on the video below.\n\nOn the tip of the can opener you'll find a small screwdriver, good for tightening everyday screws around the house. On the other end there's a bottle opener, with large screwdriver on the tip and a wire stripper at the bottom. Opposite to that sits the Reamer. Now most people don't know what a reamer is for, but simply put, it is a tool for making holes. One use case could be to make a hole in a branch or pole to run paracord through so you can more securely strap a knife to it to make a spear. This opposed to just wrapping the cord around the branch or pole, something I see a lot of guys do, which doesn't firmly hold the knife in place at all.\n\nThe Pioneer comes with a small, yet strong keyring and it has an engraving panel on back. The panel is nice, but not to big. So don't think of engraving a poem on there, not even a haiku. A first name or phone number will be about it if you're planning on keeping it readable.\n\nIf you like the Victorinox Pioneer and you would want one yourself you could follow this link to it on Amazon to check it out for yourself. It is an affiliate link, so if you decide to use it I will get a small commission. In case you do, let me just thank you ahead already. I really appreciate that, Thank you.\n\nThat's all for now, thanks for reading this far. I'd love to hear what your ideas are on what pocket knife and tool you would choose for an urban setting, and especially why, so please leave your comments below.\n\nTill next time, Kain."}

From Teneo's headquarters on the 45th floor of New York's 601 Lexington Avenue building, the company provides public affairs, investor and public relations as well as investment banking advice to its rapidly expanding client base which count Coca Cola among its ranks. The firm has more than 130 employees and offices in multiple strategic markets around the world.\n\nTeneo distinguishes itself in from its competitors in large part through the all-encompassing approach its takes to its services. The latest aspect to the business, Teneo Intelligence, is headed up by a former an ex-CIA and Department of Defense figure and aims to identify trouble spots around the world and analyse their potential effect on global markets.\n\nBefore founding Teneo in 2011, Kelly acted as economic envoy to Northern Ireland after being appointed to the post in 2009 by US secretary of state Hillary Clinton. It began an important relationship with the Clintons that has since developed with Teneo being an important advisor to the Clinton Global Initiative, the former president was in fact on the advisory board of Teneo for a time. Teneo's current president and one of its co-founders Douglas Band has been an advisor to US President Bill Clinton for 17 years and continues to serves as counselor to him.\n\nKelly's current status in corporate America represents a significant journey for a man who began his career as a journalist in the Nenagh Guardian and Tipperary Star newspapers.\n\nUntil July of 2009, Kelly had served as executive vice-president and chief integration officer of FTI Consulting, one of the world's leading international consulting companies.\n\nIn his role at FTI, a 3,500-person business with a market capitalisation of over $2 billion, Kelly was responsible for the operational integration of the company's various businesses in more than 20 countries around the world. He also had responsibility for corporate strategy, global business development, global client management and all of the company's marketing and communications functions.\n\nPrior to taking an executive officer position at FTI, he was chairman and CEO of Financial Dynamics in the United States and chairman of Financial Dynamics in Ireland. Financial Dynamics (FD) is one of the world's largest and most successful financial communications companies and Kelly was a member of the senior management team that sold FD to FTI Consulting in September of 2006.\n\nHe became part of the FD business team and moved to the US when he sold his company, Gallagher and Kelly Public Relations, to FD at the start of the last decade. Prior to that, he held a number of senior management positions with other leading communications companies in Dublin.\n\nHe began his career as a journalist and formerly worked for the Nenagh Guardian and Tipperary Star newspapers in Tipperary before joining The Cork Examiner newspaper in the mid-1990s. He was selected as the recipient of the AT Cross Business Journalist of The Year Award in 1994.\n\nA graduate of National University of Ireland, Galway, Kelly now serves as the chairman of the university's US Foundation Board and also sits on the executive board of the American Ireland Fund. His relationship to President Clinton was of vital importance to Clinton's appearance at the Worldwide Ireland Fund Conference in Cork in June of this year.\n\nKelly has been recognised on a number of occasions for business excellence and his work in the not-for-profit sector.\n\nIn 2011 he received an honorary doctorate from Queen's University Belfast in recognition of his service to business and the economy of Northern Ireland and in 2008 he became the youngest-ever recipient of the American Irish Historical Society's prestigious gold medal. The medal is given annually to one person deemed to have made a unique contribution to Irish-American society."}
{"text": "PISCATAWAY -- The phone call came to the Princeton University wrestling office, and Chris Ayres was instantly intrigued.\n\n\"I'd like to think that I came up with it, but I didn't,'' Ayres said, explaining how the concept of an outdoor wrestling match between Rutgers and Princeton originated from a phone call from Scarlet Knights coach Scott Goodale. \"It was just one afternoon in the office, nothing out of the ordinary, and then Goody calls us and says, 'Hey, do you want to wrestle us in the football stadium?' At first you're like, 'Wow, okay.' ''\n\nBut then, Ayers said, there was the matter of hammering out the details that come with staging the unique event. Could they actually contest it inside a football stadium? Would the weather conditions be ideal enough for it? How do you get fans interested in it?\n\n\"We got both staffs on the phone, put everybody on conference (call), and at the end of the day we said we (both) said we'd try to fill the stadium as much as we could,'' Ayers recalled. \"And then it was like, 'Yeah, let's do it.'''\n\nSix months after the outdoor wrestling match was announced, Rutgers officials are putting the finishing touchdowns on an anticipated doubleheader Saturday that will include the Scarlet Knights football team matching up with Penn State in an 8 p.m. kickoff at High Point Solutions Stadium.\n\nSeven hours before the Big Ten football game, at 11 a.m., the Princeton and Rutgers wrestling teams will square off on a mat placed in the north end of the stadium.\n\nWhile the football game is expected to draw more than 50,000 fans, nearly 14,000 tickets have already been sold for the wrestling match between longtime Central Jersey rivals.\n\n\"We want to be involved in huge events and you have to showcase the sport -- that's what I've been preaching the whole time,'' Ayers said.\n\nSaid Goodale: \"I think the best thing about being in Jersey is that we're able to do this in front of, hopefully, 20,000 people. You can't do that everywhere. You can do it in State College, Pa., you can do it in Stillwater, Okla., maybe you could do it in Minnesota, and obviously you could do it in Iowa.\n\n\"But you can do it in New Jersey.''\n\nRutgers and Princeton have had a long rivalry in all their sports, with their football teams staging what's regarded as the first intercollegiate football game on Nov. 6, 1869 over a patch of sod in New Brunswick where the College Avenue Gymnasium now stands.\n\nIt's why Rutgers proclaims to be the \"Birthplace of College Football.'' And it's also why Rutgers officials labeled the outdoor wrestling match as the \"Battle at the Birthplace.''\n\n\"I'm a huge, huge college football fan,'' Goodale said. \"I know when they threw that name out, it was pretty cool and I thought of college football and all the history that's gone on here, and the history with Princeton. It just made sense. It's kind of neat. It'll be a great atmosphere, and it's just a neat out-of-the-box thing, and it's what has us excited.''\n\nThe Rutgers and Princeton wrestling teams have met 79 times since first meeting on Jan. 14, 1931, with the Scarlet Knights winning 20 straight bouts to take a 41-33-5 advantage in the series.\n\n\"I don't think Scott envisions his program anywhere else but being in the top 10 consistently every year,'' Ayers said. \"I think we can do the same thing. So I feel like this is the starting point to have a really good rivalry between two top 10 teams. So it's going to be more exciting down the road.''\n\nRU's 1st sports event came 150 years ago"}

Even the public was part of the voting last year.\"\n\nIt is tough to choose a Miss Universe Malaysia who reflects most of Malaysian women.\n\nThat's because Malay-Muslims make up over half of the country's 29 million population, but are banned from participating in beauty pageants because of a 1995 fatwa.\n\n\"We have Muslim girls who are unaware of this fatwa asking to compete, but we had to turn them away,\" said Ms Fonseka.\n\nThat's why Eurasians seem to be over-represented in the competition, she said.\n\nBut a general bias towards fairer skin in the former British colony is clear. Flip through any local newspapers and advertising campaigns often show white or Eurasian models.\n\nIn the latest offering from the Asian satellite channel Diva Universal, two-thirds of the men featured in the show Hot Guys Who Can Cook are Eurasians.\n\nIt's also difficult to find skin products that do not contain ingredients that whiten.\n\nBut it's not simply because Malaysians want to look like white people, said Sarah Jade Schipper, a Miss Universe Malaysia 2013 finalist who is of Malaysian Chinese and Dutch heritage.\n\n\"Fair skin makes features stand out and you look more flawless,\" she said.\n\nBut her rival for the title, Naomi Chandrasegar, 24, said Malaysians were exposed to a steady cultural diet of Hollywood movies and Eurasian beauties on the front of magazines. \"We are conditioned to want to look like them,\" she said.\n\nThe prominence of western standards of beauty may also be motivated by local brands wanting to appear more international.\n\nIt's true for a new cosmetic surgery clinic in Kuala Lumpur. The name of the centre, Beverly Wilshire, combines the Beverly Hills district in the US and a well-known street name in that area.\n\nThe centre's medical director, Dr Mohamad Nasir Zahari, said: \"In Malaysia, unfortunately, we still think if you give something a sort of famous English name, then it must be good.\"\n\nHis centre provides regular cosmetic services, as well as skin whitening and double eyelid treatments. But the most common surgery requested by his local patients is a nose job.\n\nThat's because the noses of many Malaysian Malays, Chinese or Indians are flat and wide, said Dr Nasir. \"Somehow it becomes a gold standard that a nice nose should be like a western nose, with a high bridge, sharp tip, narrow nostrils,\" he added.\n\nBut there are small signs of change. For the first time, the Miss Universe Malaysia Organisation has done away with the height requirement of 163cm for the beauty pageant in the hope that more Asians will enter."}
{"text": "The FBI recently opened beta testing of eFOIA, a new online system for filing and tracking requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). On first glance, the project seems like a noble effort to streamline transparency in an agency that is notoriously slow and resistant to releasing public information.\n\nBut there's one feature that we would like to see treated as a bug and excised from the new system: mandatory submission of government-issued identification.\n\nEach time you want to file a FOIA request through eFOIA, you are required to upload a scan of your driver's license or other formal identification card. The FBI offers very little reasoning, except to say that it is \"So the FBI is confident in the identity of the requester.\" The FBI does not explain how people's ID cards will be stored, used, or shared, except under its rather broad existing site-wide privacy policy.\n\nTo be clear: nothing in the FOIA statute requires requesters to show a government-issued ID for a standard FOIA request, and we're not sure it's even legal to ask for it. More than 20 years ago, a federal appeals court ruled that, even when a FOIA request requires a privacy waiver, the person needs only to attest under penalty of perjury that they are who they say they are.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security's own eFOIA app, which was designed with the same intent as the FBI system, follows the court's guidance. It doesn't require ID, but if you are requesting \"Personal Records\" (for example, under the federal Privacy Act), you need to check a box declaring on penalty of perjury that all the information you've supplied is true, and then sign it electronically.\n\nMany states, such as New Jersey and California, are very clear in their policies that you can file requests for information anonymously. Just last year, a state appeals court in Florida agreed that requiring identifying information from an anonymous requester would have a \"chilling effect on access to public records,\" under the state's Public Records Act.\n\nRequiring photo ID will undoubtedly have a chilling effect, at least when it comes to using the FBI's new system. The public remains rightfully suspicious of an agency that has amassed information on individuals simply exercising their First Amendment rights as far back as the J. Edgar Hoover administration. Researchers, journalists, and activists may avoid the system for fear that it will result in further government scrutiny over their private lives. After all, many FOIA requests are intended to uncover controversial actions that could embarrass the FBI.\n\nMany people who file FOIA requests use their real name, but supply the address of where they work or a P.O. Box. By demanding photo ID, the FBI is asking these people to hand over their home addresses as well, along with a photograph, and their sex, weight, height, and hair and eye color. For the purpose of processing a FOIA request, there's no reason at all that the FBI needs to know whether you need corrective lenses to drive. Of even further concern is whether the photo ID you submit may be submitted to or compared against the FBI's massive facial recognition database that we reported on in September.\n\nIt's so far unclear how this photo requirement will affect the FOIA assistance services (e.g. MuckRock, FOIA Machine, and private law firms) who file or manage requests on the behalf of others. Many could be interested in using the eFOIA interface, but that would require these organizations to solicit driver license scans from their clients, adding a whole new point in the process where sensitive information could be compromised.\n\nThe FBI should not be collecting any more information than it absolutely needs to process a request. With FOIA, it's the public who gets to ask \"papers, please,\" not the other way around.\n\nUpdate December 13: Sen. Ron Wyden has sent a letter to the FBI echoing our concerns about the eFOIA system, along with questions about the photo ID will be used and stored."}
{"text": "Revelations about the National Security Agency (NSA) keep on coming, this time in the form of information about its elite hacking unit called Tailored Access Operations (TAO), which helps the agency target specific people and computer networks around the world and has the ability to install \"backdoors\" in computers and other devices in order to gain access to those networks.\n\nThe report, based on leaked documents from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, was published on Sunday in the German magazine Der Spiegel.\n\nThe report shows that American spies intercept computer deliveries, exploit hardware vulnerabilities and even hijack Microsoft's internal error-reporting system to spy on their targets.\n\nCiting internal NSA documents, the magazine said Sunday that TAO's mission was \"getting the ungettable,\" and quoted an unnamed intelligence official as saying that TAO had gathered \"some of the most significant intelligence our country has ever seen.\"\n\nDer Spiegel said TAO had a catalog of high-tech gadgets for particularly hard-to-crack cases, including computer monitor cables specially modified to record what is being typed across the screen, USB sticks secretly fitted with radio transmitters to broadcast stolen data over the airwaves and fake cell phone base stations intended to intercept mobile phone signals on the go.\n\nThe unit, which is based out of San Antonio is able exploit weaknesses in the architecture of the Internet to deliver malicious software to specific computers, according to the report. Some agents at TAO are tasked with taking advantage of weaknesses in hardware or software distributed by some of the world's leading information technology companies, including Cisco Systems, Inc. and China's Huawei Technologies Ltd., the magazine reported.\n\nDer Spiegel cited a 2008 mail order catalog-style list of vulnerabilities that NSA spies could exploit from companies such as Irvine, Calif.,-based Western Digital Corp. or Round Rock, Texas-based Dell Inc.\n\nThis appears to be the first revelation about the NSA that also details their exploits beyond the virtual world.\n\nDer Spiegel said that if the NSA tracked a target ordering a new computer or other electronic accessories, TAO could tap its allies in the FBI and the CIA, intercept the hardware in transit and take it to a secret workshop where it could be discreetly fitted with espionage software or hardware before being sent on its way.\n\nIntercepting computer equipment in such a way is among the NSA's \"most productive operations\" and has helped harvest intelligence from around the world, one document cited by Der Spiegel stated.\n\nThe targets of the sophisticated hacks ranged from suspected terrorists to world leaders. The NSA was able to read the Blackberry messages and emails of leaders around the world, according to the report.\n\nAccording to Der Spiegel, the documents also show that the NSA would spy by exploiting Microsoft's crash reports, familiar to many users of the Windows operating system (the little dialogue box that pops up when a program freezes). The reporting system is intended to help Microsoft engineers improve their products and fix bugs, but Der Spiegel said the NSA was also sifting through the reports to help spies break into machines running Windows. One NSA document cited by the magazine appeared to poke fun at Microsoft's expense, replacing the software giant's standard error report message with the words: \"This information may be intercepted by a foreign sigint (signals intelligence) system to gather detailed information and better exploit your machine.\"\n\nMicrosoft did not immediately return a call from The Associated Press seeking comment, but the company is one of several U.S. firms that have demanded more transparency from the NSA — and worked to bolster their security — in the wake of Snowden's revelations, whose disclosures have ignited an international debate over privacy and surveillance.\n\nThe Der Spiegel report caps off a week of attention around the NSA leaks. On Friday, journalist and Snowden supporter Glenn Greenwald chastised media for not being more critical of the government.\n\nAlso last week, a judge ruled the NSA's phone data collection program constitutional, and Snowden gave a lengthy interview to the Washington Post.\n\nAl Jazeera and wire services"}

{"text": "RIYADH (Reuters) - More than 1 million Saudi Arabians are now receiving unemployment benefit, the labor ministry said on Wednesday, underlining a source of potential discontent that the rulers of the world's top oil exporter are keen to contain.\n\nThe \"Hafiz\" program, which pays unemployed Saudis 2,000 riyals ($533) a month for up to one year, was announced by King Abdullah during the Arab uprisings last spring and introduced in late 2011.\n\n\"The number of beneficiaries this month rose by 40 percent from last month and by 170 percent from December when the program started to pay the monthly subsidy,\" said the official Saudi Press Agency, quoting Khaled al-Ajmi, the Labor Ministry official in charge of Hafiz.\n\nThanks to a decades-long population boom, the Saudi government can no longer afford to reduce unemployment by creating public sector jobs. Last year's revolutions in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, Yemen and Syria were blamed by some on high youth unemployment.\n\nOfficially the kingdom's unemployment rate is 10.5 percent, but that figure does not include the large numbers of working-age Saudis not counted as part of the labor force.\n\nRecent government figures show the labor force participation rate, meaning people who are in jobs or who say they are looking for work, is 36.4 percent, about half the global average, say economists.\n\nJeddah-based Arab News reported on Wednesday that the head of a parallel unemployment program run by the Labor Ministry said joblessness cost the government 5.5 billion riyals a year.\n\nAround 90 percent of Saudis in work are employed by the government, while 90 percent of jobs in private companies are filled by around 8 million foreigners.\n\nExpatriates tend to fill higher-paying technical roles for which many Saudis lack the experience, and very low-paying jobs that many Saudis see as menial.\n\nIn January, Labor Minister Adel al-Fakeih said the conservative Islamic kingdom needed to create 3 million jobs for Saudi nationals by 2015 and 6 million jobs by 2030, partly through the \"Saudization\" of work now being done by expatriates.\n\nLast year Saudi Arabia's economy grew by 6.8 percent, buoyed by strong oil revenues and a government spending spree. There are about 18 million Saudi nationals in the country.\n\nJOBLESS WOMEN\n\nMore than 80 percent of people receiving unemployment benefit are women, said SPA. Despite opposition from powerful religious conservatives, the government is pushing for more Saudi women to enter the job market.\n\nIt has designated women-only working environments including lingerie and cosmetics shops.\n\nSome government critics say the Hafiz program might discourage Saudis from looking for jobs in the private sector, where salaries are sometimes lower than the unemployment benefit.\n\nHowever, economists say it might also push Saudis currently listed as out of the labor force to register as unemployed, meaning the government will develop a more accurate picture of jobless levels.\n\nThose receiving benefits are added to a new national employment database that lists people seeking work alongside details of their qualifications, education and employment history to help match them with suitable employers.\n\nIn addition to the Hafiz program, the government has also introduced a new system of quotas for Saudi versus foreign employees, set according to the size and sector of each company.\n\nHowever, the official quoted by Arab News said that half of all private companies in the Middle East's largest economy were in the ministry's lowest bracket of compliance with Saudisation quotas.\n\nCompanies that perform badly in the quota system will be prevented from acquiring visas for new foreign employees.\n\nThe Labor Ministry has also sponsored career fairs in the kingdom's largest cities where it vets job seekers before pairing them with potential employers.\n\nThat initiative is aimed at reassuring private companies, which have traditionally seen imported labor as cheaper and more reliable than Saudi workers, that job candidates will be qualified for any positions on offer."}
{"text": "Former Digital Domain facilty, 10250 S.W. Village Parkway, Port St. Lucie. (FILE PHOTO)\n\nBy Nicole Rodriguez of TCPalm\n\nPORT ST. LUCIE — The city, the state and former Digital Domain CEO John Textor all will get multimillion-dollar payouts from a settlement in the two-year-old lawsuit against the defunct Digital Domain Media Group.\n\nPort St. Lucie and the state — which both provided economic incentives to bring Digital Domain here in 2009 — each will get about $3 million, according to the settlement, which was approved Friday by a federal bankruptcy judge. Textor — who presided over both the creation and the bankruptcy of the high-tech digital-animation studio — will receive more than $8 million.\n\nThe state Department of Economic Opportunity filed the suit in July 2014 against 23 defendants, including Textor, claiming the company fraudulently secured millions of dollars from the state. The city joined the suit after it was filed.\n\nThe state said the company circumvented normal channels to secure $20 million in state incentive money, which it later used as leverage to secure millions more from Port St. Lucie and West Palm Beach, according to the lawsuit.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, company officials were able to work around normal economic-development channels by \"wooing\" former Gov. Charlie Crist.\n\nPort St. Lucie gave Digital Domain $51.8 million in incentives, including land and a fully equipped, state-of-the-art studio in exchange for jobs and economic development. It will receive $3.2 million in the settlement, city officials said Tuesday. The state, which gave Digital Domain $20 million, will get about $3 million, state officials said.\n\n\"There was concern over throwing good money after bad, but we moved forward and fought the good fight,\" Mayor Greg Oravec said in a statement Tuesday. \"This prudent decision resulted in ... a big win for our citizens. This recovery does not fully repay the original investment. But, with the building sold to a caring and community-oriented new property owner, and this seven-figure payment soon to be in hand, we have made the most of a difficult situation.\"\n\nThe state, too, considers the settlement a victory, although it blamed Crist for his swift support of the failed venture.\n\n\"The deal with Digital Domain was approved in 2009 under Gov. Charlie Crist,\" Cissy Proctor, executive director of the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, said in a statement Tuesday. \"In 2011, under the leadership of Gov. Scott, DEO restructured the incentive process to prioritize accountability and transparency for the state's taxpayers, to ensure a deal like this doesn't happen again.\"\n\nTextor will receive an $8.5 million reduction on a mortgage on a property in Telluride, Colorado, according to court documents. Textor used the home to secure a $10 million loan for Digital Domain, he said.\n\nTextor said he considers the ruling vindication.\n\n\"Had the court not ruled that the management team acted truthfully, the management team would be contributing to the settlement,\" Textor said Tuesday.\n\nTextor said he would not be receiving a payout if there was evidence of wrongdoing on his part.\n\n\"After two years of evidence, the court ... and mediator further acknowledged there was no untruth told,\" Textor said. \"Obviously, we're pleased by the view of the court and the mediator.\"\n\nThe payouts will be made by Digital Domain's insurance policy.\n\nDigital Domain shuttered its doors in late 2012, just nine months after moving into its studio in Tradition, leaving more than 300 employees jobless and the city deep in debt. The city last year sold the 115,000-square-foot building to Christ Fellowship church for $13 million. It still owes approximately $35.2 million on the project, which includes interest."}
{"text": "An existential risk to humanity caused by developments in artificial intelligence is too hard to ignore, says Elon Musk, who has created a new company which aims to merge computers with human brains.\n\nMusk, who is already the chief executive of electric car company Tesla and space rocket manufacturer SpaceX (and is busy creating a new way of tunnelling with The Boring Company) is about to set up a new business called Neuralink.\n\nHours after news broke of the venture, first by anonymous sources speaking to the press, Musk tweeted confirmation and said an article explaining his plans would be published in the coming days. \"Long Neuralink piece coming out on @waitbutwhy in about a week. Difficult to dedicate the time, but existential risk is too high not to.\"\n\nFurther confirmation came from Tim Urban, founder of the Wait But Why website. He wrote: \"I guess some parts of the secret thing that was secret were leaked and now it's not really a secret anymore. Elon Musk is starting a new company.\"\n\nUrban went on: \"It's a really cool company and I can't wait to tell you about it. I was given the lowdown about it earlier this month [March, 2017] and have been rapid-fire ever since.\"\n\nMusk has voiced concern about artificial intelligence and the dangers it could pose to humanity for some time, despite himself developing a form of AI to create the autonomous driving features of his Tesla cars. He once described AI as humanity's \"biggest existential threat\" and said creating advanced AI is like \"summoning the devil\".\n\nSuch are the advances in computer AI, Musk has said humans \"will be left behind by a lot\", and that it is \"only a matter of time\" before AI takes down the internet.\n\nNeural lace\n\nNeuralink's creation stems from Musk's interest in creating a neutral lace, a way of connecting the human brain with a computer to improve our own cognitive performance. The plan is to implant tiny electrodes into the brain that may one day be capable of uploading and downloading thoughts from a computer to the brain and vice versa.\n\nAccording to company insiders speaking anonymously to the Wall Street Journal, Musk has \"taken an active role setting up the California-based company and may play a significant leadership role\". This, the paper points out, is a big ask for a father of five who already sits at the helm of two highly complex technology companies. Tesla is currently under pressure to deliver its new car, the Model 3, while SpaceX has plans for establishing a human colony on Mars.\n\nInitially, Neuralink is expected to work on treating intractable brain diseases like epilepsy or major depression, but later it could expand to help level the playing field between human and computer intelligence, the insiders say. Via a \"direct cortical interface\", or a brain-computer interface, Musk has plans to help the human brain reach higher levels of functionality.\n\nOnce the company proves it can safely combat brain diseases, people briefed on its plans say it could move to cosmetic brain surgery where patients would pay to have their cognitive performance enhanced. The people referenced comments made by Musk, where he criticised the human brain for not processing and generating information as quickly as it can absorb it. Musk said at the time: \"Your output level is so low, particularly on a phone, your two thumbs just tapping away. This is ridiculously slow, Our input is much better because we have a high bandwidth visual interface into the brain. Our eyes take in a lot of data.\"\n\nMusk is not alone in his pursuit of supercharging our brains. Earlier in 2017, Facebook posted job vacancies looking for \"brain-computer interface engineers\" and other neuroscientist roles at its secret projects division, known as Building 8.\n\nIf Musk's goal here is to increase the bandwidth of the human brain, then as a parent of five children and the boss of four companies, his own brain could well be right at the top of Neuralink's waiting list."}
{"text": "AutoGuide.com\n\nThe Viper's one-time Nurburgring lap record almost never happened. In fact, Dominick Farnbacher, who set the incredible 7:12 lap time, was never even supposed to drive the car.\n\nThat, at least, is the story according to Farnbacher's SRT Viper #91 co-driver Marc Goossens.\n\nIt's only part true.\n\nSome of the official details of the story are already known. With production of the second generation Viper coming to an end and the new car not yet being made, Chrysler officially had no cars to use for its record-setting attempt back in 2011.\n\nInstead Tomball Dodge donated two 2010 Viper ACRs for the test, which were then promptly shipped to the German race track.\n\nWhere the story really gets interesting is what happened next, something Farnbacher told us over dinner ahead of his race this weekend at Canadian Tire Motorsports Park outside Toronto, Canada.\n\nAnother driver had already been hand picked to set the record, but he couldn't do it. Less to do with his driving skill, it was more the result of the setup of the car and nature of the Nurburgring, which, Farnbacher explains, is a unique beast.\n\nHere's where Goossens' version of the story isn't quite accurate. Farnbacher wasn't hand picked by Dodge to drive the car, but he also wasn't kicking around the Nurburgring paddock by coincidence.\n\nIn fact, he had been invited by Ben Keating the owner of Tomball Dodge. Farnbacher and Keating were racing buddies and Keating, it seems, had the foresight to lock down a backup plan.\n\nWhen the other driver couldn't set the record, Farnbacher was given a shot. His knowledge of the Nurburgring was critical in making it happen. \"It's so stiff out of the factory it won't work on the 'Ring,\" he says of the Viper. In fact, the best setup for the Nurburgring is the opposite of what you'd want for most other tracks. With the ACR's adjustable shocks and springs, the car's ride height had to be raised to its max says Farnbacher. The shocks were also softened up significantly.\n\nWith those changes, Farnbacher set the Nurburgring record after just two hours behind the wheel. But the most amazing thing is, he had never driven a Viper before. . . in his life!\n\nThe goal, he said, was simply to beat the Corvette ZR1's time of 7:19, but when they saw the capability of the ACR, the team decided that a 'Ring record run was possible and they went for it, setting the 7:12 time, a full two seconds faster than the Lexus LFA, which had claimed the record only a week before.\n\nSince that run back in 2011 the ACR's record has fallen. First the Gumpert Apollo squeezed in a 7:11, then the Nissan GT-R NISMO set a 7:08. Most recently Porsche obliterated all other records with a stunning 6:57 in its million dollar hybrid supercar, the 918 Spyder.\n\nSEE ALSO: Porsche 918 Claims 6:57 Nurburgring Record\n\nThe new Viper has never officially had a run at the Nurburgring so it's not clear where it would sit in the lineup. Could Dodge ever plan to take back the 'ring Record? Farnbacher thinks so.\n\nFormer SRT boss and president of Chrysler's motorsports division Ralph Gilles has, \"a fighting spirit\" says Farnbacher before slyly adding, \"I think there might be something in the future to go for the record.\"\n\nGALLERY: SRT Viper Race Car\n\nGet the Flash Player to see this player.\n\nDiscuss this story at our Dodge Viper forum."}
{"text": "The latest global temperature data are breaking records\n\nPosted on 15 June 2015 by John Abraham\n\nJust today, NASA released its global temperature data for the month of May 2015. It was a scorching 0.71°C (1.3°F) above the long-term average. It is also the hottest first five months of any year ever recorded. As we look at climate patterns over the next year or so, it is likely that this year will set a new all-time record. In fact, as of now, 2015 is a whopping 0.1°C (0.17°F) hotter than last year, which itself was the hottest year on record.\n\nBelow, NASA's annual temperatures are shown. Each year's results are shown as black dots. Some years are warmer, some are cooler and we never want to put too much emphasis on any single year's temperature. I have added a star to show where 2015 is so far this year, simply off the chart. The last 12 months are at record levels as well. So far June has been very hot as well, likely to end up warmer than May.\n\nGlobal surface temperature estimates from NASA GISS.\n\nSo why talk about month temperatures or even annual temperatures? Isn't climate about long-term trends?\n\nFirst, there has been a lot of discussion of the so-called 'pause.' As I have pointed out many times here and in my own research, there has been no pause at all. We know this first by looking at the rate of energy gain within the oceans. But other recent publications, like ones I've written about have taken account of instrument and measurement quality and they too find no pause.\n\nSecond, there has been a lot of discussion of why models were running hotter than surface air temperatures. There was a real divergence for a while with most models suggesting more warming. Well with 2014 and 2015, we see that the models and actual surface temperatures are in very close agreement.\n\nWhen we combine surface temperatures with ocean heat content, as seen below, a clear picture emerges. Warming is continuing at a rapid rate.\n\nGlobal ocean heat content estimates from NOAA.\n\nThere is an emerging view that the so-called surface warming slowdown was caused from poor instrument coverage around the globe, volcanic eruptions, and a multi-year oscillation in the oceans. The issue of instrument coverage is being fixed as we speak.\n\nBut, any short term fluctuations can only temporarily influence the long term trend. In the ocean heat content image above, you might notice a slight change in the trend around 2005. The trend change has since disappeared; it was associated with the ocean oscillations I mentioned earlier.\n\nThe recent warming skyrocket has put the contrarians in a bad position. In 2013, when contrarian Christopher Monckton repeated a claim that temperatures might decrease by 0.5°C in two years, I challenged him to a $1000 bet. He never took that bet, but we can see he would have lost handily if he had.\n\nMore recently, contrarian Judith Curry was reported as warning about decades of cooling (or perhaps lack of warming) stretching out to the 2030s. We see that this prediction is not looking very likely. Other contrarians have made similar predictions and it makes one wonder how much evidence will have to pile up before they climb down.\n\nJust a few months ago, Roy Spencer (another climate contrarian) claimed, \"We are probably past the point of reaching a new peak temperature anomaly from the current El Niño, suggesting it was rather weak.\" While it remains to be seen whether or not he is correct, his own data have shown an uptick in temperatures, and the most recent months have continued the very warm trend. Barring something really unusual, the trend will continue until the end of this year.\n\nI asked climate expert Dr. Joe Romm, Founding Editor of Climate Progress for his thoughts. He reminds us,\n\nClick here to read the rest"}

Ashley Cooper / Global Warming Images\n\nThe polar bear's emaciated body looked more like \"a rug\" than one of the world's most powerful predators.\n\nFor all its hunting prowess, the giant animal appears to have starved to death as it made a desperate journey north on the Arctic island of Svalbard in search of seals.\n\nExperts fear polar bears will increasingly suffer a similar fate as global warming melts the sea ice that allows them to hunt for their main source of food.\n\nIan Stirling, who has studied polar bears for nearly 40 years, told The Guardian newspaper that he found the animal on Svalbard in July.\n\n\"From his lying position in death the bear appears to simply have starved and died where he dropped,\" Stirling said. \"He had no external suggestion of any remaining fat, having been reduced to little more than skin and bone.\"\n\nThe bear was examined by Norwegian scientists in April about 150 miles south and seemed to be healthy at that time.\n\n\"Most of the fjords and inter-island channels in Svalbard did not freeze normally last winter and so many potential areas known to that bear for hunting seals in spring do not appear to have been as productive as in a normal winter,\" said Stirling, of conservation group Polar Bears International. \"As a result the bear likely went looking for food in another area but appears to have been unsuccessful.\"\n\nThe bear is thought to have been heading north in a desperate search for sea ice that would allow it to hunt for seals. Scientists believe the Arctic could be essentially free of sea ice in September by 2054. Ashley Cooper / Global Warming Images\n\nA study published in July found that the Arctic could be essentially free of sea ice in September as early as 2054.\n\nPolar Bears International says on its website that the bears evolved for a life on sea ice, \"which they rely on for reaching their seal prey.\" The loss of sea ice has meant an increase in drownings and cannibalism, and a general decline in population.\n\nAshley Cooper, the photographer who took the picture, said the sight of the dead polar bear was \"desperately sad.\"\n\n\"There was just no fat on it. It was just completely shrunken and shriveled, a very, very skinny specimen of a polar bear,\" he said in a telephone interview. \"It looked basically like a rug because there was just no weight on it at all.\"\n\nCooper said scavengers had not eaten parts of the body and there were no signs of decomposition, which happens slowly in the low temperatures of the Arctic.\n\nHe said he saw five live polar bears during a 12-day trip to Svalbard in July. Three looked \"quite thin and not in great condition\" and the only one that looked healthy was hunting on sea ice barely strong enough to support its weight about 550 miles from the North Pole.\n\nCooper said the fate of the bear was \"what [all] polar bears have got to look forward to over the next 10 to 20 years.\"\n\n\"There isn't a future for them unless we can very rapidly get on top of climate change,\" he said.\n\nJeff Flocken, at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, told The Guardian it was difficult to blame climate change for a single death.\n\nBut he added \"it couldn't be clearer that drastic and long-term changes in their Arctic habitat threaten the survival of the polar bear.\"\n\n\"The threat of habitat loss from climate change, exacerbated by unsustainable killing for commercial trade in Canada, could lead to the demise of one of the world's most iconic animals, and this would be a true tragedy.\"\n\nRelated:"}

{"text": "Margaret Thatcher's decision to open up London's financial marketplace to international banks in 1986 revolutionised the purpose of London. Rather than being the capital of Great Britain and the United Kingdom it was to become the global hub for international capital. Not only were the markets opened up to international banks, the international rich were invited into London, to take residence and buy up the housing from the indigenous Londoners. Thatcher wanted to hollow out London, and show the indigenous population out of the city, to make for the international rich.\n\nThis process has been maintained and encouraged since Thatcher's departure, and the process has taken on an increased intensity in the last ten years, without global economic crises and jitters causing more and more of the international rich to move their capital and residencies into London.\n\nThe consequence has been that London's working classes, who have traditionally been ensconced in the areas around central London, e.g. Elephant & Castle and Islington have been bought out, and priced out of the rental market. Those remaining have found all the old traditional forms of life disappear, as trendy cafes', boutiques and fashion stores, together with an array of convenience stores run by people from all around the world take their place.\n\nIt is with a sense of despair that many working class Londoners, left in places, like Islington, see the gradual disappearance of the pub, and the working class culture that fostered within it. Said one such resident, living in Islington:\n\nAll the pubs – the local pubs – have shut down and there are these gastropubs where it's like £5 for a pint. I don't know who it's going to get better for in this borough, whether it's better for…I don't think for working class people or people on benefits… This little theatre here used to be a pub. I suppose that's where you can see the people who moved here. When I was a kid there'd be no need. We all went to the cinema, no need for a theatre. It's £30 for a ticket, I couldn't afford that. I'm probably not even qualified to work in the café.\n\nIn the northern parts of Somers Town, amongst the several pubs which act as their totems and meeting points, the indigenous working class can be found. A man leans out from his balcony in a string vest and smokes a fag. St George's flags hang from pub and flat windows; desperate signs of a community experiencing a social and psychological death. It has been said that the size of the English working class community in Somers Town has diminished over the last forty years. This process was facilitated by Margaret Thatcher's policy of allowing people who rented Council Houses to buy the property. In Somers Town many members of the English working class community bought their Council house, sold up and then shipped out. In effect the English working classes started to abandon their own kind.\n\nThe spaces left by those who sold-up and shipped out were filled, thanks to private landlords and state policies, with immigrants, students and middle class types. This has meant a dilution of the working class culture in the area. The new arrivals have their own way of doing things, their own interests and friends. For example students on short-term lets have no real interest in investing in local community relationships, and will be gone sooner than they have arrived. Muslims don't drink. They do Mosques not pubs. The social networks of the English working classes are thus diluted, and their sense of belonging and security diminished. Some hark back, nostalgically. One recalls, 'Somers Town was lost a long time ago. It had everything you would associate with a working class culture – a street market, greengrocers, fish shops – but these had disappeared by the 1980s. Another says 'Pubs used to be what brought people together, but they've closed now mostly. Used to be good old knees up pubs, family pubs where you knew people and you kept on eye on each other's kids playing outside'.\n\nAdvertisements"}

{"text": "As Justin Bour slugged pitch after pitch deep into the right field stands at Marlins Park July 10, it seemed, at the moment, as if Aaron Judge would have no chance of advancing past the first round of the 2017 MLB Home Run Derby.\n\nBour, a Miami Marlins player, brought the Miami crowd to its feet by hitting a remarkable 22 home runs in his first round matchup against Judge.\n\nBy the time Judge, a New York Yankee outfielder and MLB's current leader in home runs (30), stepped to the plate, the fans at Marlins Park erupted with boos. Not only was Judge favored to beat the hometown Bour, but Judge's Yankee teammate Gary Sanchez had already eliminated Marlins' Giancarlo Stanton from the derby.\n\nDespite being favored headed into the contest, 22 homers would be a tough act to follow, even for the 6-foot-7-inch, 282-pound Slugger Judge. With both the odds and the crowd against him, Judge went to work to try and challenge Bour.\n\nUnder the current home run derby rules, each player has four minutes to hit as many balls as they can over the outfield fence. There is also a bonus 30 seconds awarded to a player if he hits two balls at least 440 feet. Each player is also allowed to take one timeout.\n\nWith 2:17 remaining in his first round appearance, Judge had managed to hit just seven long balls and decided to call a timeout. He was well behind Bour's pace by then.\n\nHowever, after regrouping with a break, Judge came out on fire. In the final 2:17 of the round, Judge smashed 14 homers, including a 501-foot bomb that travelled over the Marlin statue in left center field. Having hit several balls over 440 feet, Judge was awarded with 30 seconds of bonus time, in which he delivered two more home runs, eclipsing Bour and advancing to the second round.\n\nIn round two, Judge's opponent was Cody Bellinger of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Like Judge, Bellinger is a rookie slugger who put on a show in the first half of the season.\n\nBellinger led the round off by hitting 12 home runs. Yet, even before Judge stepped back into the batter's box you got the sense that 12 homers wouldn't be nearly enough. Unfortunately for Bellinger, he was going up against a machine.\n\nIn response to Bellinger's 12, Judge posted 13 homers with well over a minute remaining in his second round at bat. Three of his homers travelled at least 500 feet, including a mammoth 513-foot shot, which was the furthest hit ball of the night.\n\nAfter defeating Bellinger, Judge moved on to the finals where he faced Minnesota Twins' Miguel Sano. Appearing to be fatigued, Sano struggled for much of the final round, but he managed to come on strong late and finish with 10 home runs.\n\nAs was the case for Bellinger, however, 10 home runs was not enough to stay ahead of Judge.\n\nHaving won over the Miami crowd with moonshot after moonshot, Judge worked quickly in the final round and hit 11 home runs well before the one minute mark, on his way to being crowned as the 2017 MLB Home Run Derby Champion.\n\nPerhaps what was most remarkable about his performance is the fact that, while everyone else appeared to be gassed by the second round, Judge never seemed to break a sweat. It's worth noting that Judge did not just pull the ball. Rather, he sprayed it to all fields.\n\nAfter an electrifying first half of a rookie season that has him as the early favorite for American League MVP, Judge's derby performance only serves to bolster his already rapidly growing legend. There's something about power hitting Yankee outfielders — like Babe Ruth, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris and Reggie Jackson — that resonates with baseball fans, and considering the struggles the sport has had recently with popularity, perhaps Judge is exactly what the game needs."}

{"text": "Brown: Emanuel backing 4 percent surcharge on Airbnb bills\n\nAnother week, another homeless initiative from Mayor Rahm Emanuel.\n\nLast week, it was a pilot program to find housing for 75 homeless people camped under Lake Shore Drive viaducts.\n\nThis week, he's signing on to a proposal by Chicago aldermen to double his proposed surcharge on house-sharing businesses like Airbnb, with the proceeds to be used to provide services for the homeless.\n\nThe resulting 4 percent surcharge on the bills of house-sharing guests would initially bring in more than $2 million annually for homeless programs, with an expectation of added revenue in the future as the emerging industry grows, administration officials say.\n\nThe dedicated local revenue stream, long sought by advocates for the homeless, will be \"groundbreaking,\" the mayor promised in an interview.\n\nOPINION\n\nSo what gives? Has Emanuel grown a heart, or is he just trying to prove there was one there all along?\n\nI'm not sure. Politics most likely, though, to be fair, he's been pretty good on many housing issues.\n\nThe explanation might be this simple: Finding more money to help the homeless will likely help the mayor gain whatever additional aldermanic support he needs for his underlying proposal to regulate the house-sharing industry.\n\nEmanuel said he plans to move forward in May with the ordinance, though he still faces opposition from multiple parties.\n\nIn a replay of the \"new economy\" battle playing out between taxi companies and ride-sharing services like Uber, hotel interests object on grounds that Emanuel's regulations are too easygoing on the tech-based lodging services. They contend that some of the house-sharing companies operate what in effect are unregulated hotels that unfairly compete with them.\n\nThe real estate industry also has concerns. The Chicago Association of Realtors says tenants and condo owners should be required to submit affidavits attesting they have permission from their landlords or condo associations to rent their units. The underlying point: Many apartment and condo dwellers who already house-share don't have such permission.\n\nAirbnb is also displeased. The company argued the proposed 2 percent surcharge Emanuel unveiled in January was unfair to middle-class people renting out their homes on weekends. Doubling it to 4 percent doubles that unhappiness.\n\nDespite those hurdles, Emanuel said: \"I have no doubt we're going to pass the ordinance.\"\n\nI have no position on the underlying Airbnb ordinance without more study.\n\nBut I think it's a great idea to direct revenue from this new industry to homeless people, given the roundabout probability the Airbnbs of the world are going to further contribute to housing displacement.\n\nThere's definitely a need for revenue. Even if the city can cobble together funding to provide housing for homeless people, federal and state budget cuts have decimated the services needed to help them stay there.\n\nThose can include mental health treatment , substance abuse counseling and job-readiness training.\n\nEmanuel's original proposal directed the money to homeless families. With the need to address growing homeless encampments, some funds will be switched there, he said.\n\nAld. Ameya Pawar (47th), who teamed with Ald. James Cappleman (46th) on the idea of doubling the surcharge for homeless services, said doing so was enough to secure his support for the Airbnb ordinance.\n\n\"I think this is a good balance,\" Pawar said.\n\nThe Chicago Coalition for the Homeless also supports the surcharge plan.\n\nAdministration officials said the mayor remains open to considering further changes based on other concerns raised by aldermen but rejects Ald. Brendan Reilly's position that the administration should scrap its proposal and instead enforce the stricter vacation rental ordinance that took effect in 2011.\n\nAfter two weeks of our making nice, the mayor assures me he will do something in the coming week for which I can criticize him. I told him I look forward to it."}
{"text": "Two years after an American trophy hunter infamously killed Cecil the Lion in Zimbabwe, another huntsman shot one of Cecil's sons dead.\n\nXanda, a 6-year-old lion, was fatally shot by a big game hunter outside Hwange National Park, The Telegraph reports. Oxford University researchers who monitor the lion population in the park identified Xanda due to a tracking collar that they had fitted him with.\n\nOxford zoologist Andrew Loveridge, who is part of the monitoring team, confirmed to HuffPost that the reports were accurate.\n\n\"As researchers we are saddened at the death of a well-known study animal we have monitored since birth,\" he said in a statement. Xanda left behind a pride of three females and seven cubs.\n\nThe hunter was acting legally when he killed Xanda. Richard Cooke, the Zimbabwean professional hunter who accompanied the man who shot Xanda, returned the collar to researchers. Cooke's client, the shooter, has not been identified.\n\n\"[Cooke] is ethical and he returned the collar and communicated what had happened,\" Loveridge told the Telegraph. \"His hunt was legal and Xanda was over 6 years old so it is all within the stipulated regulations.\"\n\nHunting is prohibited inside Hwange National Park, which is a protected area, but animals like Xanda and Cecil are at risk if they wander outside the boundaries.\n\nLions of Hwange National Park, a Facebook group that reports on the lions at the park, posted about the death on Thursday, noting that Xanda was killed \"a few days ago.\"\n\nDr. Luke Hunter, president and chief conservation officer of global big cat conservation group Panthera, told HuffPost that Xanda's death leaves his cubs vulnerable.\n\n\"The role of the male lion in lion society is really to provide security,\" Hunter said. Male lions protect the females and cubs in their pride from threats like other aggressive males who may try to take over the group. If an outsider male does take over, the first thing they do is kill the cubs to make way for their own progeny.\n\nWhile this process happens naturally, hunting \"accelerates\" the process and leads to young, strong males in their prime being killed ― rather than the older, weak males who would be ousted by natural mechanisms, Hunter said.\n\nHe added that Xanda's loss would have significant consequences for the Oxford conservation program.\n\n\"He's a collared lion, [which provides] high resolution data which is just gold to these scientists,\" he said. \"You need this information to be able to make informed recommendations to the authorities and the decision makers.\"\n\nHunter said it's \"problematic\" to allow hunting right next to the border of protected areas like national parks. He'd like to see a \"buffer zone\" outside the park boundaries, to make sure that areas like parks ― which contain ideal habitats for animals like lions ― are as protected as possible.\n\nThe killing of Xanda's father Cecil, a 13-year-old lion who was well known at Hwange National Park and part of the Oxford study, sparked public outrage around the world and brought increased scrutiny on trophy hunting.\n\nWalter Palmer, the American dentist who killed Cecil, was initially accused of participating in an illegal hunt. A Zimbabwean court ultimately threw out charges against Palmer, as well as charges against the professional hunter who led Palmer's hunt.\n\nTrophy hunting, which typically involves tourists paying money for permits to hunt big game like lions, is a lucrative industry in Zimbabwe. Hunting lions — with some stipulations — is legal in the country if a person has the proper paperwork. Palmer reportedly paid $54,000 for his hunting trip that led to killing Cecil.\n\nSince Cecil's 2015 death and the resulting backlash, multiple major airlines have begun refusing to ship carcasses of big game animals like lions and elephants, and the U.S. has tightened its regulations around issuing lion hunting permits and importing \"lion products.\""}

Neither does its spokes person model: Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, who has signed on as the public face of the clothing line.\n\nFor now, the 42-item collection is limited to menswear, and includes pants, shirts, sweaters, hoodies, jackets and coats. According to Authentic Apparel, each garment was individually approved by the U.S. Army, ensuring that the clothing line meets the rigorous standards of the largest and oldest branch of the U.S. military. In other words, these clothes are rugged enough to withstand even The Rock's rough-and-tumble lifestyle (he does most of his own stunts, you know).\n\nMost of the items in the line — bomber jackets, khakis, henleys, etc. — originated as military uniform, but are now common to civilian wardrobes. In an ironic effort to render them more \"authentic,\" the company added field and dress details like kevlar threading and epaulets. The occasion underscores both the public's boundless appetite for military-inspired garb, and the surprising extent to which military accoutrement has already been absorbed into popular culture.\n\nWristwatches, for example, were a military tool during World War I, when the U.S. Army used them to synchronize precision attacks (they were easier to consult than the more ubiquitous pocket watches). Similarly, RayBan aviators were designed for U.S. Air Force pilots in the 1930s, as a way to prevent headaches and altitude sickness caused by sun glare. They became a household a name two decades later, when Hollywood's leading men adopted them as an accessory. Trench coats were developed for the British Army in the 19th century, and took their name from the grimy trenches in which soldiers fought and died during World War I. Even the iconic Burberry trench has military roots: In 1901, Thomas Burberry submitted to the British War Office an officer's raincoat design made with his own proprietary water-resistant fabric.\n\nAnd khakis, now a staple of casual menswear, were a product of colonial India. In 1846, a British district officer in charge of a troop in Peshawar realized that the soldiers' white cotton uniforms proved easy targets for snipers. So, his troops began dying their uniform with tea (or mud, depending on whom you ask), to better blend in with their surroundings. Ten years later, the Magistrate of Meerut, a city in Utter Pradesh, adapted this discovery and formed the Khaki Risala, or \"Dusty Squadron.\" Since then, khaki has trickled down to every branch of the U.S. Armed Forces.\n\nThe U.S. Army has licensed all kinds of products, including electronics, toys, and camping gear, but this is its first notable foray in fashion (hopefully not the last). While some soldiers might turn up their noses at the notion, there is an upside for them: By federal law, licensing fees from all branded products must benefit the Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Program, which provides social and educational services to soldiers, retirees, and their families. For some, that may be a pleasing alternative to lining the pockets of high fashion designers, whose military-inspired peacoats and trousers aren't even sewn with kevlar thread."}
{"text": "\"If there's someone who has successfully been able to crack the use of technology to get a wider customer reach and base, it's Domino's Pizza,\" Aruj Garg, Founder of Bhukkad, had told in a conversation with YourStory. It's pure technology that has helped Domino's reach a large base of audiences, not only in India but across a global scale.\n\nIf you take a look at the figures globally, Domino's Pizza saw an increase of close to 750 per cent (Forbes). The key reason for this growth hasn't been the quality and taste of the pizzas alone, it's been a cutting edge digital and technology strategy. The digital systems are so strong that it becomes easier for consumers to place, track, pay, and pick their orders. This is the case even for India.\n\nUsing data to understand consumer behaviour\n\n\"We today have in our database close to around 20 million unique consumers,\" said Ajay Kaul, CEO, Jubilant Foodworks at NPC. From a bucketed approach of clustering customers, Ajay says that Domino's has evolved to a stage where each and every consumer is a segment. So, now every time a stimulus is thrown, the systems are able to analyse the kind of response each consumer will provide.\n\nAlso read: Touted to be a $50 billion market, growing at 16 per cent YOY – where is the Foodtech market headed?\n\nTracking every link of the chain\n\nIt all begins with ensuring that the consumer gets the best experience possible. Categories like food and food delivery, which are highly perishable technology, play a vital role. Ajay believes that every single degree matters, from sourcing to cooking to delivery, every process in the value chain is important.\n\nHe said that every time there is a shift or discrepancy alerts are sent. The oven, for example, has intelligent systems that track temperatures and energy efficiency. The trucks sourcing ingredients are tracked. \"While it may seem that pizza is a pizza at the end of the day, and technology doesn't have much of a role, we believe that something as simple as a pizza needs to be monitored with technology,\" adds Ajay.\n\nDelivering food at high transient spots\n\nDomino's currently is working on a project of creating a food consumption ecosystem, which makes it easier for people to order and get pizza delivered even at railway stations. Apart from creating raw infrastructure of physical stores at these stations, Ajay adds that they're also looking to integrate it seamlessly with IRCTC and technology.\n\nOn the Juhu beach side, Domino's currently has an order taking site, which is connected via wifi to a store nearby. Thus, consumers place their order on the beach, which in turn is transferred via wifi to the neighbouring store, and the pizza is delivered on site\n\nThere are close 30,000 employees of Domino's pizza of which approximately 20,000–25,000 are consumer-facing. Domino's is looking to hand these people with devices that will enable payments, GPS tracking, and feedback among other things. \"We want the consumers to know what route the delivery boy will be taking, and track every step,\" adds Ajay.\n\nPizza Mobile\n\nDomino's currently is working on an idea of co-creation. It will be giving the consumer the power to participate in the creation process. This where, Ajay says, that the emotional connection with the brand will be stronger. Citing a hypothetical example Ajay says that with this concept, an individual can go online create his or her own pizza and call it whatever they like. Consumers then can rate these pizzas, and the pizza that sells the most will get named after the individual who created it, and they even get a percentage of the sale. This, Ajay adds, is in the long run.\n\nDomino's in the West launched its iPad app that has a 3D pizza builder, apart from the pizza tracker, pizza Hero, and customer pizza profile."}
{"text": "It's not easy being young these days — especially where employment is concerned.\n\nA recent report from Statistics Canada found that full-time employment among young people (17-24 years of age, excluding full-time students) has declined significantly since the late 1970s. This is not just the result of a bumpy economy. Youth are more likely to be unemployed than the rest of the employable population, regardless of the business cycle.\n\nThe 15-year span between 1990 and 2015, saw an average youth unemployment rate of almost 12 per cent — well above national averages for adults. And youth under-employment is estimated at 27 to 33 per cent.\n\nThe youth of today are often decried as entitled or lazy, but these stereotypes don't reflect the realities of current employment opportunities. Increasingly, the jobs offered to youth are temporary, contract, unstable and part-time — reflecting a trend present across other OECD countries.\n\nThe federal Liberals have committed to doing better, promising \"more jobs and better opportunities for young Canadians.\" That's why Ottawa launched an Expert Panel on Youth Employment, which will soon issue a final report with suggestions for tackling the issue.\n\nSo, what can be done to tackle the employment obstacles facing Canada's youth? Plenty.\n\nThe good news is that we don't have to look too far to find successful models for youth skills development and employment — the solution is in our own backyard. Too often, government reports and media accounts wax poetic over our fine universities as a source for solutions to our youth employment challenges. Our equally impressive polytechnics get lost in the discussion.\n\nMany might be surprised to hear that graduates from Polytechnics Canada member schools (2014-2015) enjoyed an employment rate of 86 per cent within six to nine months of graduation.\n\nHow is this possible?\n\nPolytechnics are distinct from universities because of their close relationships with industry to design program content, to meet labour market demands and for their R&D and innovation solutions.\n\nDon't be misled by those who might paint such a discussion as an either-or debate between polytechnics and other post-secondary forms of education. In fact, an increasing number of university students are turning to polytechnics as \"finishing schools\" to ease transition into the labour force. In the 2014-2015 academic year, 14 per cent of full-time polytechnic students had already completed a university bachelor's degree.\n\nPolytechnics help youth, and others, launch their careers by prioritizing work-integrated models of learning.\n\nThere are four key ingredients we'd like to see in a federal solution to youth employment.\n\nFirst, the federal government must invest in better labour market information from Statistics Canada. Youth cannot make informed career choices without data on skills in demand, employment outcomes by education type, or the earning power of specific credentials.\n\nSecond, new youth employment initiatives should take advantage of the existing resources at polytechnic and college employment centres.\n\nThird, apprenticeships need a jump-start with secure funding, public awareness, and programs to connect apprentices with employers. Canada needs a culture shift wherein apprenticeships are valued with the same esteem as other credentials. Those in the skilled trades are truly some of Canada's best and brightest. The contribution the skilled trades make to our economy and their necessity in growing it, must be acknowledged. The federal government should promote the new Canada Apprentice Loan — a recent pilot program which gives apprentices support similar to the Canada Student Loan Program.\n\nFinally, there needs to be an overhaul of the federal Youth Employment Strategy. A federal work-integrated learning strategy could enable field placements, internships and professional practice. An improved strategy should include career counselling, interview preparation and the inclusion of part-time and newly graduated students.\n\nIf the government wants to tackle the problem of youth unemployment in Canada, looking to how polytechnics offer youth direct pathways to the labour market might be a good place to start.\n\nNobina Robinson is the chief executive officer of Polytechnics Canada."}
{"text": "Update: They did the exact same segment on Smackdown Tuesday night.\n\nEvery October, the WWE is awash in a sea of pink—trotting out its pink ring ropes and ribbons in commemoration of breast cancer awareness month. It's a noble endeavor that a high-profile sports-entertainment company would commit so much primetime air for a cause that afflicts one out of every eight women in their lifetime. For that, the WWE—and their partnership with the Susan G. Komen Foundation—should be commended.\n\n\nOn last night's episode of Monday Night Raw from Denver, a segment aired where the Raw women's roster, breaking kayfabe, stood in the ring as a unit, as three breast cancer survivors were presented with WWE championship belts. Some watched and might have thought, \"that's a nice gesture.\" My reaction was more of discomfort.\n\nThe segment was hosted by Dana Warrior, widow of the wrestler Ultimate Warrior, who died suddenly three days after being inducted in the WWE Hall of Fame in 2014. In WWE's telling of the Ultimate Warrior narrative, the man born Jim Hellwig exemplified a fighting spirit, who never gave up, and lived every moment of his 57-year life like it was his last—essentially, a living embodiment of a motivational speech. \"Please join me in honoring their warrior spirit!\" Dana Warrior said to cheers from the Denver crowd.\n\nSeeing these three women in Warrior shirts on WWE isn't just bringing attention to breast cancer, though—it's also posthumously rewriting the long history of Warrior's hateful diatribes. Although we don't know how he would have felt about WWE participating in breast cancer awareness month, we do know about his treatment of many others. He said that gay men suffered from the same \"disease\" as pedophile priests. At a speech he delivered in 2005 at the University of Connecticut, Warrior (he legally changed his name from Hellwig) remarked \"queering don't make the world work.\" Our colleagues at Deadspin has a far more complete anthology of Warrior's many disparaging and hateful remarks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince Warrior's death, the WWE has established what it calls the Warrior Award, presented during its annual Hall of Fame ceremony. In a long show with plenty of levity and insider wrestling references, the Warrior Award is the serious part of the proceedings. The company has given the award to an eight-year-old WWE fan who died of cancer, a Rutgers football player who was paralyzed on the field and became a motivational speaker, and former morning show host and cancer survivor Joan Lunden. It's hard to watch this and not get swept up by the emotions of it all. But every year I watch it, something in the back of my head can't get over the man whom the WWE named this award after. He literally once wished cancer would kill off Bobby Heenan. It's as if Warrior, who ostensibly said Hurricane Katrina victims were fat and poor and had it coming, never happened.\n\nOn Tuesday's episode of Wrestling Observer Radio (subscriber only), Dave Meltzer—the country's preeminent pro wrestling journalist—expressed the same distaste about the segment.\n\n\n\"The lionizing of Warrior really bothers me, especially right now. He said stuff worse than almost anybody when he was alive... it really rubs me the wrong way,\" Meltzer said. \"I just find this whole thing, of somehow, breast cancer survivors wearing Ultimate Warrior T-shirts for this guy who said all that hateful gay stuff. I found it very repugnant. It didn't wash well with me.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Monday Night Raw segment was just a continuation of WWE's remaking of its backstory in a more flattering light. The company asking these three women to shake the ropes—Ultimate Warrior's signature in-ring move—provided the applause cue they wanted, but such craven opportunism shifts the spotlight away from breast cancer awareness to a man whose words and actions the WWE would rather you forget."}
{"text": "The US military has handed down much less severe sentences in similar cases, although civilian courts have been tougher\n\nThe 35-year sentence given to Bradley Manning on Wednesday, for passing classified military documents to WikiLeaks, was criticised by many observers as being especially harsh when compared to punishments that have been meted out for similar crimes.\n\nAlthough prosecutors had demanded he serve at least 60 years, there is a sense among observers that the length of Manning's imprisonment is harsh, especially when compared to the punishments given to other military and government personnel convicted of leaking information or other crimes.\n\nMarine Sergeant Clayton Lonetree\n\nLonetree, the only marine to have ever been convicted of espionage, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for providing the Soviet KGB with the identities of CIA agents in the 1980s. Lonetree had also handed over the floor plans of US embassies in Moscow and Vienna. His sentence was reduced to 15 years when the secretary of the navy found that the effect of his actions \"was minimal\". He was released after serving nine.\n\nArmy Specialist Albert T Sombolay\n\nIn 1991, Sombolay was convicted in a military court of giving a Jordanian intelligence agent information on the build-up for the first Iraq war. He had also passed on documents and samples of US army chemical protection equipment. He was sentenced to 34 years in jail, of which he served only 12.\n\nMichael Peri\n\nPeri, a military electronic warfare systems analyst for the US Army, was convicted of espionage in 1989. He was found to have stolen a portable computer used to store classified military information and handed it to East Germany. Peri pleaded guilty to espionage charges and was sentenced to 30 years in prison – avoiding a life sentence.\n\nThe Haditha killings\n\nUS marine Frank Wuterich with his lawyers. Photograph: Gregory Bull/AP\n\nThe punishment for military personnel convicted of arguably more serious crimes is often less than what Manning faces. In 2005, 24 unarmed Iraqi men, women and children were gunned down by a group of US marines in what became known as the Haditha killings. Charges were filed against eight marines, then dropped against seven. Murder charges against the remaining suspect, Frank Wuterich, were reduced to involuntary manslaughter and aggravated assault. Wuterich struck a deal with military prosecutors and pleaded guilty to one count of negligent dereliction of duty. He was sentenced to forfeit two-thirds of his pay for three months, and a reduction in rank to private.\n\nAldrich Ames\n\nThe US civilian courts have tended to give harsher sentences than their military counterparts. Ames, a 31-year veteran of the CIA, is one of the more famous espionage convicts.\n\nIn 1994, he was arrested and accused of spying for the Soviet Union since 1985. Ames was convicted of passing classified information about CIA and FBI \"human sources\" to the KGB and details of technical operations relating to the Soviet Union during his time in Turkey and Italy. Upon returning to the US, he continued to pass documents to the KGB; the CIA and FBI found their Russian sources were being executed. Ames was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nRobert Hanssen\n\nHanssen, a former FBI agent who was convicted in 2001 of spying for Moscow, was sentenced to 15 consecutive sentences of life in prison without the possibility of parole. He had first provided information to the Soviet Union in 1979 and had continued to divulge secrets – and the identities of agents– throughout the 1980s and 90s. Among Hanssen's crimes was giving up the identities of three KGB agents who were working for the US – two of them were executed. Hanssen was apparently unaware that all three had already been exposed by Ames.\n\nA government transparency advocate, Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists, said the sentences handed to Ames and Hanssen in civilian court were determined by their being career intelligence officers who had knowingly supplied foreign governments with US secrets over a number of years. In Ames's case, his disclosure led to two men being killed."}
{"text": "Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) will meet for their eighth primary debate Wednesday evening in Miami, one night after Sanders pulled off a huge upset and narrowly defeated Clinton in Michigan.\n\nIt wasn't that long ago that the Democrats were only supposed to meet for six debates, but both candidates believed it was to their advantage to negotiate for more as it became clear that Sanders was posing a legitimate threat to Clinton's campaign. Their debate Sunday evening in Michigan focused in large part on the lead-contaminated water crisis in Flint, as well as on international trade, but immigration did not come up. That's guaranteed to change on Wednesday, since the debate will be hosted by the Washington Post and Univision, the Spanish-language television network.\n\nClinton's campaign hopes to blunt Sanders' bid by crushing him in Florida on Tuesday, where recent polls have had her up by 30 points over Sanders. Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio also hold their Democratic primaries the same day. Since Florida sends 246 delegates to the Democratic convention this summer, it is by far the biggest prize of the night.\n\nWhile Sanders has defeated Clinton in majority-white states like New Hampshire, Colorado, Minnesota, Maine, Kansas, Maine, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Vermont, Clinton has won by much larger margins in states with larger nonwhite electorates. She's won every contest in the South, as well as the Iowa and Nevada caucuses and the Massachusetts primary.\n\nLatino voters -- and nonwhite voters in general -- could be pivotal in upcoming races, Florida in particular. Pew Research Center reports that Latinos make up about 18 percent of eligible voters in the state. While immigration does not rank as the first priority for most Latino voters, it is often a decisive one.\n\nClinton is currently leading among Latino Democrats in Florida, according to a Washington Post-Univision News poll released Wednesday. Sixty-eight of them support her, versus 21 percent who support Sanders. There was a similar margin on immigration; 66 percent of Latino Democrats polled said they trusted Clinton more on the issue, while 18 percent chose Sanders.\n\nBoth Clinton and Sanders are trying to appeal to the pro-reform voters, with promises to immediately push for bills in Congress or to act on their own -- going further than President Barack Obama has -- if those legislative efforts fail.\n\nThe campaigns gave a preview of their attack lines in dueling calls with the press on Tuesday, bringing out Latino lawmakers and former officials to do so. Sanders supporters, including Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), said Clinton was inconsistent on the issue, citing her 2007 opposition to driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants and her 2014 statement that unaccompanied minors coming to the U.S. from Central America \"should be sent back.\"\n\nClinton supporters hit back, pointing out that although he voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2013, Sanders voted against it in 2007. He also broke with Democrats in a 2006 vote to protect Minutemen militias that patrolled the southern border, and was generally absent from reform efforts during his time in the House, Rep. Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) told reporters on a call.\n\nGutiérrez said Latinos should ask \"where was he before he was running for president?\"\n\n\"The truth is that at the moment when we needed someone to stand up and defend our vision of immigration, at the moment when immigrants were being demonized, Sanders was playing for the wrong team,\" he said.\n\nWhile Clinton still has a relatively comfortable lead over Sanders in delegates, the senator's campaign has said he is going all the way to the convention. He certainly has enough money to do so, as small-dollar donors who aren't yet maxed out helped him out-raise Clinton in January and February. Since the states that vote on Tuesday are delegate-heavy ones, and are awarded proportionally, Sanders needs to keep as close to Clinton as possible to maintain the argument that he's better-suited to take on the Republican nominee in November."}

And it has the same kind of problems as those books. Namely, it can be a little deceptive/suspicious. First of all, I absolutely cannot stand this format of footnotes, where they are not numbered in the text, just like in Woodard's Republic of Pirates. I understand most people probably don't read footnotes, but I do, and it sure gets on my nerves when I go fact-checking in the footnotes and see that a claim is not even LISTED, much less sourced. That makes it very hard for me to trust any information presented to me. So that being said, this book does a much better job when it is working off real evidence--which is to say, the parts of the book about the government officials and politicians, who left enough of a historical paper trail to substantiate Burgess' writing. When he starts talking about the pirates, I have to check out. He leans HEAVY on the General History, which he attributes to Daniel Defoe. This is certainly not unique to Burgess--it seems like practically every piracy author does the same thing. The General History is a book that piracy scholarship really needs to disavow, and it honestly makes me cringe when I see authors relying on it as a source of information, just because they assume their readers will trust it. In a similar vein, it was extremely irritating to find an illustration in the book of Blackbeard fighting Maynard, which Burgess describes as a \"surprisingly accurate\" \"contemporary woodcut\". This despite the fact that Maynard is drawn in a waist-length waistcoat, cutaway coat, long trousers, and BICORN hat, dating this image to something like 100 years after the event it depicts! This image is as contemporary as the General History is trustworthy.\n\n\nThis isn't a bad book, but the topic is broad enough (spanning multiple decades in multiple different colonies) that it gets confusing remembering who is who and why they matter. There are countless governors, lords, customs agents, council members, etc etc etc, who can keep track? Burgess tries to help us with occasional ~novelized~ passages, such as the opening passage about Blackbeard, but I have to admit they kind of annoyed me. I don't need to read half a paragraph describing someone mailing a letter, nor do I want to hear an author presenting his interpreted attribution of emotional experience as fact. (No footnotes...and often not even a qualifier like \"perhaps\" or \"it seems likely that\") And bizarrely, sometimes information is repeated throughout the book...he writes on page 118 that John Hoar commanded a ship called the John and Rebecca, \"named, touchingly, after himself and his wife\". Later on page 208...he writes that John Hoar named a ship the John and Rebecca, \"after himself and his wife\". Did you forget you told us this already? This happens a couple times because the massive scope of the book means that Burgess picks a storyline to follow for a while, but then when he chooses another thread to follow, he has to go back in time a little to catch us up on this overlapping narrative, mixing up the timelines and plots.\n\n\nWell anyway, this book does have some useful information in it. I was disappointed in some pretty niche ways, but I understand most people probably won't have the same issues that I do."}
{"text": "If I had a dime for every time I've seen or heard a Jazz fan complain about the Jazz passing on Paul George in the 2010 draft, I would be able to pay for a lower bowl seat to a Jazz game. I think the clamor from Jazz fans has been for a few reasons:\n\n1. It's easy to love a player that you only see highlights of and harder to love your own player who you watch 3 times a week, warts and all.\n\n2. Paul George was just named to the All-Star team. I mean, he's an All-star. Hayward is a 6th man.\n\n3. Gordon Hayward can't do this:\n\n\nI am the president of the \"circumstance over talent\" club, which is a club I just made up comprised of NBA fans who see the difference between a player who is truly better at basketball and a player who just has a better opportunity to put up numbers or succeed. And with Gordon Hayward and Paul George, I think most Jazz fans believe George is a little or much better than Hayward, but I am not so convinced.\n\nBefore I show you some numbers, i must explain that I am not a huge fan of the way Per-36 minutes numbers are often used. If you are using them to show why a guy who plays 12 minutes and scores 8 points would average 24 points if given 36 minutes, that is probably a misuse of the stat. But if you are trying to standardize stats for two different players who play different amounts of minutes, but both play close to 36 minutes against top competition for most of the game, I think it's a useful tool. With that in mind, here are the Per 36 minute numbers for Hayward and George.\n\nWhich player is better? The top player is a significantly better rebounder and slightly better assist getter. But the bottom player is better in almost every other category. More points, less turnovers, better shooting from the field, the 3 point line and the free throw line. And the bottom player gets to the free throw line at a much better rate. The bottom player is Gordon Hayward and the top player is Paul George. To me, the big difference is that George is a much better rebounder and plays 11 more minutes per game. Other than that, Hayward is better at almost everything.\n\nPaul George\n\nGordon Hayward\n\nThere are a couple things I think are important to this data. First, look at how Hayward's usage percentage has steadily climbed during his career. Part of this is due to is coming off the bench, but he actually has the ball in his hands as much as Paul George does, almost to the decimal point. And the fact that Hayward has increased his usage by a large amount, AND has cut his turnovers down, is super encouraging.\n\nSecondly, I think every Jazz fan has lamented Hayward's turnover problems, but he actually turns the ball at a lower rate than George does. In fact if you look at synergy, which is a pretty good way to document the way a player uses offensive possessions, you will see that Hayward is really George's equal.\n\nHayward averages 0.94 points per possession to George's 0.9. George is a slightly better isolation scorer, but when both are put in pick n roll situations, George turns the ball over 22.5% of the time to Hayward's 24% of the time. So while there is a ton of room for improvement for Hayward on pick n rolls, he isn't lagging far behind George, although both are significantly behind contemporaries like John Wall, Evan Turner or even Kyrie Irving, players who use up to 30% of their possessions in pick n roll situations, while keeping their turnover percentages down around 17%. But Turner has several of his own limitations and Irving might be the best player in the NBA in 6 years.\n\nSo the next time you hear a Jazz fan lament at the fact that the Jazz drafted Gordon Hayward instead of Paul George, just tell them that Hayward is as productive as George is, if not even more."}
{"text": "After two years of having to use sheep shears and scissors, Norman Wells is going public with their plight in the hope attracting a professional coiffeur\n\nWanted: one hairdresser. Must be willing to withstand temperatures that can drop as low as -50°C (-58F) and be able to rectify years of DIY trims and amateur styling.\n\nAfter two years of making do without a hairdresser, the isolated northern Canadian town of Norman Wells in the Northwest Territories – population 800 – is going public with their plight in the hope of attracting a coiffeur.\n\n\"It's been a long struggle for us,\" said Nicky Richards, the economic development officer leading the recruitment effort for this town that sits near the southern edge of the Arctic Circle. \"We just don't have anyone. It's something that people down south don't even ever think about because they don't have to worry about it.\"\n\nMany residents have had to turn to family members to cut their hair or attempt to do it themselves. \"We're trying to figure out ways to maintain ourselves,\" said Richards, who regularly gives the same buzz cut to her husband, a friend and her boss. \"I'm not a hairdresser by any set of means, but I do have a set of clippers and that's what I use,\" she told the Guardian.\n\n\nWhen it comes to her own long locks, Richards prefers to hold out, taking advantage of out-of-town trips to schedule hair appointments. It's not the most practical solution, given that the nearest hairdressers are at least a 17-hour drive away, or a four-hour daily flight to Edmonton, in Alberta, costing upwards of C$800 ($577/£400) each way.\n\nMany in town simply let their hair grow, constantly testing the limits of how long they can hold out. \"I was in desperate need of a haircut,\" resident Ryan Spurrell told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. \"So we just did it … in the front yard there, down by the parking lot, with a pair of sheep shears and some scissors.\"\n\nOver the decades, several hairdressers have come and gone from Norman Wells, leaving behind a workspace in a local inn outfitted with chairs, mirrors and a sink. It's currently available for lease, meaning any entrepreneurial hairstylist need only bring their tools and products. As the town serves as a hub for several surrounding communities, the potential clients number in the few thousand.\n\nThe recruitment effort will hopefully get people thinking about the varied business opportunities available in Canada's north, said Susan Colbeck, who works at the local branch of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, while also solving a longstanding grievance. \"We definitely need someone. Anyone who came here would be loved so much.\"\n\n\nSince Richards began spreading the word, the town has heard from a few interested people.

Lowry and DeRozan are one of only three backcourts averaging at least 20 points apiece.\n\nDeRozan finished with 23 in a 104-100 win over the Suns on Nov. 24, 2014, in the most recent meeting at Toronto, but did not play in a 125-109 loss in Phoenix on Jan. 4.\n\nThe Raptors have defeated three 2014-15 playoff clubs during their run, including the Los Angeles Clippers and Cleveland. Tied for the fewest home games among Eastern Conference teams, they can take advantage of a favorable stretch with seven of the next eight coming at Air Canada Centre.\n\nPhoenix (7-9) makes its first stop on a five-game trip after allowing season highs in points, field-goal percentage (56.8) and 3-point percentage (57.9) in Friday's 135-116 loss to Golden State. The Suns let the Warriors hit 22 of 38 from beyond the arc, falling one shy of the NBA record for 3s.\n\n\"We had defensive breakdowns with the flow of the game,\" said T.J. Warren, who had a career-high 28 points. \"That's part of basketball. We just have to keep playing hard through the adversity.\"\n\nThe Suns haven't been able to do that during their season-high losing streak, allowing an average of 118.8 points on 51.4 percent shooting - including 47.3 from beyond the arc.\n\nMaking matters worse, Chandler, their primary rim protector and leading rebounder with 8.8 per game, is doubtful after straining his right hamstring in the first quarter Friday.\n\nAt least Phoenix won't have to worry about Jonas Valanciunas, who totaled 48 points and 21 rebounds in last season's series. The 7-footer is expected to miss six weeks with a broken left hand.\n\nBrandon Knight and Eric Bledsoe each scored 21 on a combined 18-of-32 shooting against the Warriors. They're the league's only backcourt averaging 21 points or more each.\n\n\"You've got to pick your poison,\" Bledsoe, who totaled 45 points versus Toronto last season, told the team's official website. \"Is it going to be me or Brandon?\"\n\nSince winning 14 in a row in the series, the Suns have lost four of the past seven meetings.\n\nCopyright 2015 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

(Photo: Susana Bates / AFP/Getty Images)\n\nTesla Motors Inc. is the most recent automaker to bow out of next month's 2016 North American International Auto Show in Detroit.\n\nThe California-based electric car manufacturer joins Jaguar, Land Rover and BMW's Mini as brands opting to drive past the 2016 show after having a presence on the main show of Cobo Center in 2015.\n\nA Tesla spokesperson confirmed the move on Friday.\n\n\"After much consideration, we have decided against participating at the North American International Auto Show. We've always had a very good experience at Detroit,\" a company spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n\"In Michigan, we have great owners, a strong supercharger network that connects the U.S. with Canada, and are continuing to hire talented employees. But as a small player, Tesla relies on auto shows to not only showcase our products, but engage with consumers and ultimately sell more cars in the region. We are working to change laws so that we are licensed to open stores and service vehicles. Until that happens NAIAS is not an optimal venue for driving our mission to put more EVs on the road.\"\n\nThe decision is in-line with comments made by Diarmuid O'Connell, Tesla vice president of business development, on Nov. 20 in Detroit. He said he wasn't sure if the company would have a presence at the Detroit show and hinted the costs associated with a show might be too much especially since Tesla can't sell its vehicles in Michigan.\n\n\"The truth is there is a cost associated with being at these shows. And if you're trying to sell cars, that makes sense,\" he told reporters. \"Making the huge investments that go into setting up these booths and the staffing over the course of two weeks, particularly in a state like Michigan where we can't even sell cars, begs some questions.\"\n\nMax Muncey, the show's public relations manager, confirmed that Tesla informed officials that the company was not planning to purchase space on the show floor. A Tesla spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\n\"I'm very confident we will quickly fill that space,\" Muncey said. \"We're in talks with other automakers and partners. There's a lot of interest.\"\n\nO'Connell last month said Tesla's newest car — the Model 3 — is expected to go into production by the end of 2017 and consumers will get to see the car in March 2016, which is around the time of the New York International Auto Show.\n\nBoth Jaguar Land Rover and Mini cited the Detroit auto show not aligning with their respective brand strategies.\n\nHelping fill the voids will be newcomer the Robb Report and Aston Martin, which will return to the show for the first time since 2009.\n\n\"They don't attend any other auto shows, so to bring them back to the show was a great partner to have,\" Muncey said.\n\nThe Robb Report — recently purchased by prominent Detroit businessman Dan Gilbert, founder of Quicken Loans — is a magazine that features high-priced products.\n\nThe 2016 Detroit auto show is open to the public from Jan. 16-Jan. 26. Thousands of news media from more than 60 countries and industry officials also attend the show prior to it opening to the masses.\n\nSetting up the multimillion dollar stages, lighting and displays takes three months. Crews started preparing the space in mid-October. Event organizers say this year's setup is particularly important, as about 75 percent of the show floor will be all-new or significantly redesigned for the more than 40 expected worldwide debuts.\n\nmwayland@detroitnews.com\n\n(313) 222-2504\n\nStaff Writer Melissa Burden contributed\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1QiDEEt"}
{"text": "Reminder: The Dev Alpha is not a BlackBerry 10 Phone. RIM has made this message loud and clear, but we'll repeat it once again for good measure before we give some thoughts on the device:\n\nThere's been a lot of talk about the BlackBerry 10 Dev Alpha device leading up to BlackBerry World 2012 and the BlackBerry 10 Jam , including some leaked photos that we posted this past weekend of what we *believed* was the Dev Alpha device. Turns out those early photos were the real deal, which we confirmed when we received an early hands-on look at the Dev Alpha device.\n\nTo be clear, this is not a BlackBerry 10 device. It's the BlackBerry 10 Dev Alpha. It includes a modified version of the BlackBerry PlayBook OS which shows the path to the BlackBerry 10 OS, which has been customized to a phone. This device will allow developers to test the applications they are building with our BlackBerry 10 .\n\nThe Dev Alpha definitely looks like one would expect a BlackBerry 10 development device to look. It has the appearance of a shrunken down PlayBook tablet, featuring a 4.2\" touchscreen display at 1024x768 pixel resolution, which is the same resolution of the PlayBook (which puts the pixel density at over 300 DPI). Another PlayBook similarity is the OS. The Dev Alpha as developers will receive it is running a stripped down version of the PlayBook OS, which when loaded features only the web browser and camera as apps. Developers can, of course, sideload their apps for testing and as the launch of BlackBerry 10 phones nears, developers will receive OTA updates to the device.\n\nPicking Up the Dev Alpha\n\nPicking up the Dev Alpha for the first time!\n\nConsidering the Dev Alpha is *just* a developer device, it gets us really excited for what the actual first BlackBerry 10 phone will look like. Reading through previous comments on CrackBerry related to the leaked Dev Alpha photos, a lot of you out there would be happy as punch if BlackBerry put out a phone with this hardware as it is in these photos. And looking at the phone in person, it does look pretty nice, with that utility feel of the PlayBook.\n\nOn the subject of size, the device is what I'd call everyday usable big. With a 4.2\" display, the Dev Alpha makes the iPhone look tiny, but the Dev Alpha still feels good in the hand compared to some of the other smartphones out there, which have taken display size a little too far in my opinion (at some point a phone becomes a tablet...). Knowing that developers need to test their apps for given resolutions, one thing we can expect to carry over from the Dev Alpha to the first BlackBerry 10 phone is that awesome display.\n\nAs noted above, RIM made it clear that looks aside, even the underlying guts of the Dev Alpha shouldn't be taken as representative of the first BlackBerry 10 phone. In other words, you can expect an even faster chipset to be powering the BlackBerry 10 phone you buy compared to what's in the Dev Alpha. And we're ok with this. The guts in the Dev Alpha are still pretty solid, so even faster is even better.\n\nThe big question mark for us still after going hands-on with the Dev Alpha is of course the OS experience. On the Dev Alpha we're still looking at the BlackBerry PlayBook OS, which uses bezel gestures to navigate around the device and swipe between apps. But that's the PlayBook OS, and we know RIM has been heads down working on BlackBerry 10 and we're dying to see it.\n\nBottom line: The BlackBerry Dev Alpha device is a nice piece of kit that gets us salivating for real deal BlackBerry 10 phones. We hope all the developers getting a free one at the BlackBerry 10 Jam put it to use and build tons of apps so we can download them when BlackBerry 10 phones hit the market later this year. Let's get to it devs. You build those apps, and we'll blog the hell out of them and spread the word!\n\nPhotos of the BlackBerry 10 Dev Alpha Device"}
{"text": "PORTLAND, Ore. February 1, 2012. Yellow-cedar, a culturally and economically valuable tree in southeastern Alaska and adjacent parts of British Columbia, has been dying off across large expanses of these areas for the past 100 years. But no one could say why--until now.\n\n\"The cause of tree death, called yellow-cedar decline, is now known to be a form of root freezing that occurs during cold weather in late winter and early spring, but only when snow is not present on the ground,\" explains Pacific Northwest Research Station scientist Paul Hennon, co-lead of a synthesis paper recently published in the February issue of the journal BioScience. \"When present, snow protects the fine, shallow roots from extreme soil temperatures. The shallow rooting of yellow-cedar, early spring growth, and its unique vulnerability to freezing injury also contribute to this problem.\"\n\nYellow-cedar decline affects about 60 to 70 percent of trees in forests covering 600,000 acres in Alaska and British Columbia. The paper, \"Shifting Climate, Altered Niche, and a Dynamic Conservation Strategy for Yellow-Cedar in the North Pacific Coastal Rainforest,\" summarizes 30 years of research and offers a framework for a conservation strategy for yellow-cedar in Alaska.\n\nSome key findings include:\n\nThe complex cause of yellow-cedar decline is related to reduced snow, site and stand characteristics, shallow rooting, and the unique vulnerability of the roots to freezing in low temperatures.\n\nLow snow levels and poor soil drainage lead to impact root injury and the eventual death of yellow-cedar trees. The tree thrives in wet soils, but its tendency to produce shallow roots to access nitrogen on these sites made it more vulnerable when spring snow levels were reduced by climate warming.\n\nYellow-cedar health depends on changing snow patterns, thus locations for appropriate conservation and management activities need to follow the shifting snow patterns on the landscape.\n\nSome responses to shifting climate are expected to be complex and difficult to anticipate. Long-term multidisciplinary research was needed to determine the true role of climate in the health of yellow-cedar and untangle it from other processes and natural cycles in forests.\n\nThe yellow-cedar is a slow-growing tree; many are 700 to 1,200 years old. The tree has long been culturally significant to Native Alaskans who use it to make paddles, masks, dishes, and woven items. The wood is also very valuable commercially (for home and boat building) because of its straight grain, durability, and resistance to insects.\n\nAttention is now directed toward a solution to protect and manage yellow-cedar, as coastal Alaska is expected to experience less snow but a persistence of periodic cold weather events in the future.\n\nScientists are working with partners in the Alaska Region of the Forest Service to use this new information as the framework for a comprehensive conservation strategy for yellow-cedar in Alaska in the context of a changing climate.\n\n\"We also have ongoing projects with colleagues in the Tongass National Forest in Alaska on planting and thinning to favor yellow-cedar on suitable habitat,\" adds co-lead author and station scientist Dave D'Amore, \"especially on well-drained productive soils where most of the commercial forestry exits. Silvicultural techniques can be used to nudge the ecological niche of yellow-cedar, making it more competitive on these favorable sites.\"\n\n###\n\nOther coauthors of the synthesis are Paul Schaberg, U.S. Forest Service, Northern Research Station; Dustin Wittwer, U.S. Forest Service, Alaska Region; and Colin Shanley, The Nature Conservancy.

But experiences in Dallas highlight what government authorities can do, firmly and quickly, to try to stop more people from getting infected — at a time when the public is increasingly wary of government intrusion and authority.\n\nMore:\n\n• Minnesota labs may balk at testing blood\n\n• Photos of the response in Liberia, US\n\n• All Ebola stories at MPR News\n\nThe state can lock you up for weeks. It could order your kids home from school and in some cases, kick you out of your job, at least temporarily. Health officials can inspect your house, open up your health records and maybe even seize your remains if you get sick and die.\n\nThe government has to have a lot of discretion, and to treat individual health care and public health differently, Minnesota health commissioner Ed Ehlinger said.\n\n\"Sometimes, public health goals and outcomes really conflict with that individual privacy,\" he said. \"If someone has an infectious disease and doesn't want to be quarantined or isolated, we sometimes have to do that for the protection of the general public. And that's what public health is all about. And that's where the potential struggles are going to be.\"\n\nThat idea dates back to the very beginnings of the U.S. health care system in the 19th century.\n\n\"We tried to quarantine people coming in from other places that had cholera or other infectious diseases,\" Ehlinger said. \"The public health service was established to really quarantine folks coming from outside the country.\"\n\nDallas officials ordered the family of Ebola victim Eric Duncan into a quarantine after they didn't go into seclusion voluntarily. And New Jersey officials ordered NBC health correspondent Nancy Snyderman to stay in her home after she violated a voluntary quarantine request and was spotted at a restaurant. One of her colleagues contracted Ebola when they were in west Africa recently.\n\nMinnesota offers some guarantees to people it suspects might get ill, such as ready communication with health care providers and the chance to appeal a quarantine order in court, according to attorney James Conway, of Shakopee, who studies state law and quarantine The state also requires authorities to use the least restrictive environment possible for quarantine.\n\nConway doesn't forsee widespread legal challenges to quarantine, but said it raises a host of issues: What does \"least restrictive\" mean? Who decides? And what happens while people wait to see if they'll really get sick?\n\nAnother worry: job loss. Federal workplace protection laws may help some people, Conway said. \"The Americans with Disabilities Act might apply to someone in a detention situation, so that they would likely not have fear of losing their job if they were placed under a quarantine.\"\n\nIn Minnesota, there are laws protecting employees and even a provision to recover lost wages in the event of an outbreak, he added.\n\nBut other situations and answers aren't so clear. What about property rights, for example? In Texas, officials stripped bare the apartment where Ebola victim Eric Duncan stayed, packed everything in more than 140 barrels, and incinerated it. The cleanup cost an estimated $100,000.\n\nMinnesota Department of Health spokesman Doug Schultz said authorities have been weighing the practicality of such measures, and the need to clean up potential hazards, versus the risk of exposing more people to infection. Officials have decided to call the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency to people's homes if any so-called \"Ebola houses\" turn up in the state.\n\nPeter Sandman, a risk communication consultant in New York, said its hard to know how much authority it would take to stem an Ebola outbreak in the United States. But whatever the rules, Sandman said the key to making them work will be to apply them fairly,\n\n\"There's a real tension between protecting everybody's health and protecting everybody's liberty,\" he said. \"But if you start diminishing some people's liberty but not other people's liberty, then that calls the whole enterprise into question.\"\n\nLike everyone else, he hopes we won't have to find out if that happens."}

{"text": "The stability of a key Antarctic glacier appears to have taken a turn for the worse as a large iceberg that broke off during September has swiftly shattered. Meanwhile, scientists are concerned that the rate of sea level rise could further accelerate in a world forced to rapidly warm by human fossil fuel burning.\n\n(Iceberg drifting away from the Pine Island Glacier rapidly shatters. Image source: European Space Agency.)\n\nThis week, a large iceberg that recently calved from West Antarctica's Pine Island Glacier rapidly and unexpectedly disintegrated as it drifted away from the frozen continent. The iceberg, which covers 103 square miles, was predicted to drift out into the Southern Ocean before breaking up. But just a little more than two months after calving in September, the massive chunk of ice is already falling apart.\n\nThe break-off and disintegration of this large berg has caused Pine Island Glacier's ice front to significantly retreat. From 1947 up until about 2015, the glacier's leading edge had remained relatively stable despite significant thinning as warmer water began to cut beneath it. But since 2015, this key West Antarctic glacier has begun to rapidly withdraw. And it now dumps 45 billion tons of ice into the world ocean each year.\n\n(Glaciers like Pine Island balance on a geological razor's edge. Because they sit on a reverse slope, it only takes a relatively moderate amount of ocean warming to precipitate a rapid collapse. These collapses have happened numerous times in the past when the Earth warmed. Now, human-forced climate change is driving a similar process that is threatening the world's coastal cities. Image source: Antarctic Glaciers.)\n\nThe present rate of melt is enough to raise sea levels by around 1 millimeter per year. That's not too alarming. But there's concern that Pine Island Glacier will speed up, dump more ice into the ocean and lift seas by a faster and faster rate.\n\nPine Island Glacier and its sister glacier Thwaites together contain enough water to raise seas by around 3-7 feet. The glacier sits on a reverse slope that allows more water to flood inland, exposing higher and less stable ice cliffs as the glacier melts inland. If the glacier melts too far back and the ice cliffs grow too high, they could rapidly collapse — spilling a very large volume of ice into the ocean over a rather brief period of time. As a result, scientists are very concerned that Pine Island could swiftly destabilize and push the world's oceans significantly higher during the coming years and decades.\n\nPine Island Glacier: the movie. From Oct 2014 to recent calving in 108 #sentinel1 images @CopernicusEU @ESA_EO pic.twitter.com/oYKvelCKPd — Stef Lhermitte (@StefLhermitte) October 13, 2017\n\nNo one is presently predicting an immediate catastrophe coming from the melt of glaciers like Pine Island. However, though seemingly stable and slow moving, glacial stability can change quite rapidly. Already, sea level rise due to melt from places like Greenland and Antarctica is threatening many low-lying communities and nations around the world. So the issue is one of present and growing crisis. And there is very real risk that the next few decades could see considerable further acceleration of Antarctica's glaciers as a result of human-forced warming due to fossil fuel burning.\n\nDr Robert Larter, a marine geophysicist at British Antarctic Survey, who has researched Pine Island Glacier in his work with the Alfred Wegener Institute, recently noted to Phys.org:\n\n\"If the ice shelf continues to thin and the ice front continues to retreat, its buttressing effect on PIG will diminish, which is likely to lead to further dynamic thinning and retreat of the glacier. PIG already makes the largest contribution to sea-level rise of any single Antarctic glacier and the fact that its bed increases in depth upstream for more than 200 km means there is the possibility of runway retreat that would result in an even bigger contribution to sea level.\"\n\nCREDITS:\n\nHat tip to Colorado Bob\n\nHat tip to Erik Friedrickson\n\nAdvertisements"}
{"text": "Q: My oldest son informed my husband and me that he was getting married. After our initial excitement, we learned that he would be getting married outside of the church. My husband and I are deeply divided about this issue; I think that we should attend, but he refuses to go. What should we do?\n\nA: This is a dilemma that many modern Catholics are grappling with: Should I attend a wedding of a baptized Catholic who chooses not to follow the proper canonical form for their wedding? In other words, should I attend an invalid wedding?\n\nThe Code of Canon Law says that a baptized Catholic is bound by the canonical form of marriage: \"Only those marriages are valid which are contracted before the local ordinary, pastor, or a priest or deacon delegated by either of them, who assist, and before two witnesses.\" (Can. 1108)\n\nAlthough canon law directs and sets the parameters for the celebration of matrimony, it does not prohibit Catholics from attending weddings that are, in canonical terms, \"invalid.\" So there is no right or wrong answer to your question!\n\nIn short, there are no specific church teachings that direct our response to these situations. If we attend the wedding, it could give the impression that we are condoning it. But if we refuse to attend, it could cause irreparable harm to relationships (especially familial).\n\nTo begin with, we have to bring this to prayer and follow the promptings of the Holy Spirit who will inform our conscience and will help to direct us in making the right choice. Next, we should carefully weigh the options before us: to attend or not to attend.\n\nChurch teaching can offer some guidance during this crucial part of our discernment. There are some good reasons to consider not attending. Participating in the wedding could be seen as approval of an \"invalid act.\" This is an important consideration because baptized Catholics are prevented from participating in the sacramental life of the church as a consequence of an invalid wedding. The Catechism of the Catholic Church has some strong words regarding this: \"Adulation is a grave fault if it makes one an accomplice in another's vices or grave sins.\" (CCC 2480)\n\nSacramental marriage is a beautiful and powerful public act which is a tremendous blessing not only for the couple but also for the church and ultimately all of society. When a baptized Catholic chooses not to enter into a valid marriage, they will not receive the sacramental graces that help a couple successfully live out their lifelong commitment to each other. So it is a serious matter if our actions give the appearance of personal approval to a baptized Catholic who has chosen to marry outside the church.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some good reasons to consider attending a wedding even when a baptized Catholic has chosen not to follow the proper canonical form. With the precipitous drop in weddings throughout our church and society, the fact that a couple is willing to enter into a committed or vowed relationship together, although imperfect, should be seen as a step in the right direction!\n\nThere is a certain degree of good and value in the natural institution of marriage as opposed to simply cohabitating. By attending their wedding, you may be able to help the couple see that their marriage is good and could be something much greater. By maintaining a positive relationship with the couple, it's possible you could become a voice of conscience that could motivate them to seek a sacramental wedding in the future.\n\nOur response should navigate between the extremes of relativistic approval and outright rejection. There are minefields down both paths. If you elect not to attend, it will be important to let the parties know, in a charitable way, your reasons. If you decide to attend the marriage (but not participate), it also will be important to explain the church's teaching and the reasons for your decision.\n\nAt the end of the day, with the assistance of the Holy Spirit, only you can make the \"right\" decision!\n\nMay God's blessings be with you today and always!\n\nNorthwest Catholic - October 2015"}
{"text": "In this year, NBA 2K18 is going to deliver the Nintendo Switch owners a fantastic basketball experience that PlayStation and Xbox owners were enjoying. At the NBA 2K18 preview event in New York, some people had played the Switch version of NBA 2K18, MmoGah shares with you more about what they found out:\n\nThis Is a Fully Featured Game\n\nThe Switch version of NBA 2K18 will feature all the major modes that are coming to the other consoles. That means you can build a franchise in MyGM, create an online franchise with friends in MyLeague, become a NBA superstar in MyCareer, construct a team via the card collecting MyTeam, flex your skills in MyPark or Pro-AM. You can play all these modes included in the game. The only thing you can't do is to customize your own logo for Pro-Am teams.\n\nThe Switch Version Uses the Same Engine As the PS4/Xbox One Versions\n\nThe Switch version of NBA 2K18 features the same animations, A.I., and controls as the PS4/Xbox One versions. That said, when it comes to graphical fidelity and performance, there will be obviously a delta. Visually, the Switch version looks great on smaller screens, but the graphics are a noticeable step down. The game also runs at 30fps instead of the 60fps the other consoles enjoy.\n\nSwitch Controls Are Adequate\n\nAs it comes to sports games, the fidelity of control is paramount. It would be tough to string together the dribbling moves if the analog stick movements aren't precise. But you will find how responsive the controls are when you play the Switch version.\n\nExpect Regular Game Updates\n\nThe game will receive regular updates as the PS4, Xbox One, and PC versions. Switch owners don't need to worry about being left on the outside whenever 2K push new MyTeam cards, roster updates, gameplay changes, and the like.\n\nLocal Play Leverages Switch Capabilities\n\nThere are some interesting options for you and your friends. Four Switch consoles can be linked together for local play, and up to eight players can join in on the action.\n\nThe Digital Download Is Roughly 25GB\n\nAccording the Visual Concepts, the final file size is expected to come in around 25GB. However, with the constant updates the game gets over the course of the NBA season, you should budget a lot more storage space.\n\nRetail Copy Details\n\nThe retail version of NBA 2K18 does not release the same day as the digital version on September 19. You have to wait until October 17 to get the cartridge.\n\nStaying within Wi-Fi Range Strongly Recommended\n\nVC powers the NBA 2K experience, it is used for player customization, MyTeam card purchases, purchasing a franchise in MyGM. So if you want the full NBA 2K18 experience, you have to stay connected. You can also play MyCareer or MyGM offline, but you won't receive the benefits.\n\nNo Amiibo Support\n\nThere won't be Amiibo functionality in the game at this time.\n\nNo Cross Compatibility\n\nYou may want to play the majority of your games on PS4 at home, then take that MyGM or MyCareer save on the road with the Switch. This is an interesting idea, but it isn't happening with NBA 2K18.\n\nCheck out more NBA 2K information from MmoGah, including latest news on NBA 2K18. NBA 2K18 will be available for customers who prepay on September 15, we will launch NBA 2K18 MT coins as soon as the game hits stores. You can still buy NBA 2K17 MT in our store now. As a professional NBA 2K MT coins seller, we provide safe and cheap MT coins with fast delivery for you, and we have receive high praise from gamers who have placed 2K17 MT orders.

The researchers published their results in the journal Science in December 2014, where they propose a new type of transistor made from these materials.\n\nThe computational allocation was made through XSEDE, the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment, a single virtual system funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) that scientists use to interactively share computing resources, data and expertise. The study was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and the NSF.\n\n\"To me, national computing resources like XSEDE, or specifically the Stampede and Lonestar supercomputers, are extremely helpful to computational scientists,\" Xiaofeng Qian said. In January 2015, Qian left MIT to join Texas A&M University as the first tenure-track assistant professor at its newly formed Department of Materials Science and Engineering.\n\n\"To me, national computing resources like XSEDE, or specifically the Stampede and Lonestar supercomputers, are extremely helpful to computational scientists.\" Xiaofeng Qian, Assistant Professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Texas A&M University.\n\nWhat Qian and colleagues did was purely theoretical work, using Stampede for part of the calculations that modeled the interactions of atoms in the novel materials, two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC). Qian used the molecular dynamics simulation software Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package to model a unit cell of atoms, the basic building block of the crystal lattice of TMDC.\n\nScientists diagram the electronic band structure of materials to show the energy ranges an electron is allowed, with the band gap showing forbidden zones that basically block the flow of current. Spin-orbit coupling accounts for the electromagnetic interactions between electron's spin and magnetic field generated from the electron's motion around the nucleus.\n\n\"We found a very convenient method to control the topological phase transition in these quantum spin Hall interlayers.\" Xiaofeng Qian, Assistant Professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Texas A&M University.\n\nThe complexity lies in the details of these interactions, for which Qian applied many-body perturbation theory with the GW approximation, a state-of-the-art first principles method, to calculate the quasiparticle electronic structures for electrons and holes. The 'G' is short for Green's Function and 'W' for screened Coulomb interaction, Qian explained.\n\nThe big picture for Qian and his colleagues is the hunt for new kinds of materials with extraordinarily useful properties. Their target is room-temperature quantum spin Hall insulators, which are basically near-two-dimensional materials that block current flow everywhere except along their edges. \"Along the edges you have the so-called spin up electron flow in one direction, and at the same time you have spin down electrons and flows away in the opposite direction,\" Qian explained. \"Basically, you can imagine, by controlling the injection of charge carriers, one can come up with spintronics, or electronics.\"\n\nThe scientists in this work proposed a topological field-effect transistor, made of sheets of hexagonal boron interlaced with sheets of TMDC. \"We found a very convenient method to control the topological phase transition in these quantum spin Hall interlayers,\" Qian said. \"This is very important because once we have this capability to control the phase transition, we can design some electronic devices that can be controlled easily through electrical fields.\"\n\nQian stressed that this work lays the theoretical ground for future real experiments in the lab. He hopes it might develop into an actual transistor suitable for a quantum computer, basically an as-yet-unrealized machine that manipulates data beyond just the binary of ones and zeros.\n\n\"So far, we haven't looked into the detailed applications for quantum computing yet,\" Qian said. \"However, it is possible to combine these materials with superconductors and come up with the so-called Majorana fermion zero mode for quantum computing.\""}
{"text": "What IT: Chapter 2 Should Do With The Book's Most Psychedelic Parts, According To Bill Skarsgard By Eric Eisenberg Random Article Blend SPOILER WARNING: The following article contains certain spoilers about the end of Stephen King's IT, and therefore potential spoilers for the developing IT: Chapter 2. If you have not read the book, and don't wish to know how it all ends, please bookmark this page and save it until you're ready to read! Prior to Andres Muscheitti's film, there were a few reasons why Stephen King's IT was considered unadaptable in the medium, and only one of them was the extreme length of the story. Another is the fact that the end of the book winds up getting extremely trippy and weird in its third act, with both the kids and adults' storylines leading to confrontation with the titular monster on an inter-dimensional battlefield. Obviously this element was entirely left out of the recently released movie, but star Bill Skarsgard really wants to see IT: Chapter 2 fully embrace it. Discussing the nature and mind of Pennywise in the novel, he recently said, It's hardly answered in the novel, either. I mean, it's very abstract. And I kind of like that. It could be almost a sort of surrealistic sort of psychedelic trip if you go into the mind of Pennywise. And if you've read the novel you know that they do actually go into his mind. Or they go into this trans-dimensional place, and they sort of beat him in this place. Which might be interesting, what that place would be, and what would it look like. There's opportunities, I think, and I'm excited for it. Bill Skarsgard is currently promoting his second Stephen King adaptation of 2017, the new Hulu series Castle Rock, but while speaking with IGN at New York Comic-Con this past weekend he also took the time to talk about what he would like to see in IT: Chapter 2. The actor was asked about the possibility of the sequel delving deeper into his monstrous character's mind, and Skarsgard noted that he thinks there are some fantastic visual opportunities to explore with that idea in the source material. In the novel, there are a couple chapters that dive into the nature of Pennywise, and it's revealed that he is an ancient, interdimensional entity who feeds on fear for sustenance so that he can last through his 27-year hibernation periods. Defeating IT requires the fight being brought to ITs own home turf - in a \"ceremony\" called The Ritual of Chud - and how it's described in the book would be a sincere challenge to directly adapt on screen. The Losers Club performs the Ritual of Chud when they are both children and adults, but just because it wasn't featured in Andres Muschietti's IT doesn't mean that it won't wind up in IT: Chapter 2. In fact, Bill Skarsgard argues that the sequel actually should be a very different film, as what scares children and what scares adults are two very different things, and that deserves exploration. Said Skarsgard, The first movie worked so well at what it is trying to do, I think, and ultimately that is the kids' story, and you follow these kids and you sort of fall in love with these kids. And the second one will be the adult story. And I think the right way to do it is to make that movie actively different. ... I think there might be worth exploring sort of the psychological aspects of horror, but also maybe the sort of cosmological existence of this being. What is he, and where does he come from? When didn't actually know when we would be getting IT: Chapter 2 for what felt like a long time to an impatient mind - but that mystery was solved a few weeks back.

{"text": "ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Hundreds of people including opposition politicians protested outside the trial of two prominent Turkish journalists facing life in prison on espionage charges on Friday, hours after President Tayyip Erdogan denied curbing press freedoms.\n\nCan Dundar, editor-in-chief of Cumhuriyet (L), accompanied by his Ankara bureau chief Erdem Gul, arrives at the Justice Palace for his trial in Istanbul, Turkey April 1, 2016. REUTERS/Osman Orsal\n\nCan Dundar, editor-in-chief of the Cumhuriyet newspaper, and Ankara bureau chief Erdem Gul are accused of trying to topple the government with the publication last May of a video purporting to show Turkey's state intelligence agency helping to ferry weapons into Syria by truck in 2014.\n\nTheir case has brought international condemnation and raised concerns about freedom of expression in Turkey. At their first hearing a week ago, the court took the case behind closed doors and accepted Erdogan as a complainant in what critics said was a move that undermined judicial independence.\n\n\"During the legal process, the president personally intervened, both as a complainant and through his repeated public statements. Turkey's judicial system is not strong enough to shrug off the dominance of this president,\" Muharrem Ozay, a lawyer for the two journalists, told Reuters.\n\nErdogan has cast the newspaper's coverage as part of an attempt to undermine Turkey's global standing and has vowed that Dundar will \"pay a heavy price\".\n\nHe has acknowledged that the trucks, which were stopped by gendarmerie and police officers en route to the Syrian border, belonged to the MIT intelligence agency and said they were carrying aid to Turkmens in Syria. Turkmen fighters are battling both Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Islamic State.\n\nAli Seker, one of more than a dozen opposition members of parliament outside the court room, said he and his colleagues were trying to exercise their legal right to observe the case and were concerned that Gul and Dundar might be re-arrested.\n\nThe court on Friday rejected the opposition applications, lawyers said. Supporters chanted \"You cannot silence the free press\" and \"Shoulder to shoulder against fascism\".\n\nThe two journalists spent 92 days in jail, almost half of it in solitary confinement, before the constitutional court ruled last month that pre-trial detention was unfounded because the charges stemmed from their journalism and they were released.\n\nErdogan said he did not respect that ruling.\n\nINTERNATIONAL CONCERN\n\nThe trial comes as Turkey tries to deflect criticism from the European Union, United States and rights groups that say it is bridling a once-vibrant press.\n\nThere were ugly scenes in Washington on Thursday, where Erdogan is on a visit, as his bodyguards tried to stop protesters chanting and waving banners outside the Brookings Institution think-tank where he was speaking.\n\n\"Turkey's leader and his security team are guests in the United States,\" said Thomas Burr, president of the National Press Club. \"They have no right to lay their hands on reporters or protesters or anyone else for that matter ... Erdogan doesn't get to export such abuse.\"\n\nIn his speech at Brookings, Erdogan warned he would continue to sue critics who insult him in Turkey, while in an interview with CNN, he denied being \"at war\" with the press.\n\n\"Espionage, do you think it is a freedom of expression or a freedom of press?\" he told the broadcaster.\n\nAhead of the trial, Dundar told Reuters he would use the hearings to refocus attention on the story that landed him in the dock, describing himself as a witness not a defendant.\n\nErdogan has said prosecutors had no authority to order the MIT trucks be searched and that they were part of what he calls a \"parallel state\" run by his ally-turned-foe Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based Islamic cleric who the president says is bent on discrediting him and the Turkish government.\n\nThe prosecutors have denied those allegations, while Gulen has denied plotting against the government."}
{"text": "We had the perfect storm of weather conditions this summer to contribute to a severe infection of powdery mildew on squash, specifically our butternut and spaghetti squash. The squash leaves with mildew died back, exposing the fruit to sunscald at its formative stage. It's not uncommon for squash leaves to have powdery mildew, but as it affects yield, how can you go about treating powdery mildew in squash? Read on to learn more.\n\nSquash with Powdery Mildew\n\nPowdery mildew spreads rapidly and can travel a long distance. In addition to squash plants, it may afflict any number of veggies, including:\n\nHowever, there is a different species of powdery mildew that attacks each different veggie. In the case of cucurbits, there are three different fungal species responsible for causing powdery mildew: Podosphaera xanthii, Golovinomyces cucurbitacearum, and Golovinomyces orontii.\n\nContrary to what you might think, powdery mildew on squash is not prevalent during wet growing seasons. In fact, moist conditions are not necessary at all to foster this fungus and it quite likes it hot. Hence, the aforementioned \"perfect storm\" here in the Pacific Northwest; we have had an unusually dry, hot summer.\n\nSo how do you identify powdery mildew in squash? This disease is fairly obvious in appearance. It appears on older leaves first, as reddish brown spots. At onset, the disease can only be identified via microscope, but quickly it will become apparent as it rapidly spreads to create white mildew covered leaves, petioles and stems. This powdery mycelium makes the leaves appear to have been dipped in talc. The leaves lose their normal dark green hue, turn pale yellow, then brown and finally shrivel, leaving the squash exposed to sunburn.\n\nConidia (spores) are rapidly produced in the powdery mycelium and any wind or air movement carries them to adjacent plants and leaves as well as off to plants situated even farther away. In fact, it only takes three to seven days from initial infection to appearance of symptoms. Powdery mildew thrives in dense plantings, shaded to low light exposure and high relative humidity. Infection can occur anywhere between 50-90 F. (10-32 C.), but it favors warmer temps up to 80 F. (26 C.), but not over 100 F. (37 C.). Also, powdery mildew in cucurbits is spread because the disease overwinters and is spread to successive generations of squash.\n\nPowdery Mildew Control\n\nAlong with the perfect storm of weather conditions, we no doubt aided and abetted the disease. As mentioned above, the disease overwinters. Practicing a crop rotation will go a long way in preventing the spread of powdery mildew. Do not plant cucurbits in the same area for at least two years. We did not practice crop rotation; I blame my other half.\n\nAdditional management techniques for treating powdery mildew in squash are to destroy any diseased plant debris, space plantings since a densely planted plot is more likely to be infected, and plant resistant varieties when possible. Also, keep the garden free of weeds. Powdery mildew control may also be need to be combined with a timely application of a fungicide.\n\nWhen using fungicides, it's too late for them to be of any use once symptoms become rampant. Fungicides work by preventing infection of healthy foliage, so find the infection early. There are a number of organic options available as well as traditional fungal sprays.\n\nSulfur and \"Stylet\" oil are effective products for powdery mildew control.\n\nFixed copper fungicides have also shown results in managing powdery mildew.\n\nNeem oil is also an effective combatant for managing powdery mildew.\n\nWhatever you choose, remember the key is early application, before the disease is readily apparent all over the foliage."}

(I'll write another post on how to combine the scripts here with MDT)\n\nOverview:\n\nAssuming you have a licensed version of Windows 10, the Windows 10 Media, a network and access to all the computers over the network it will be possible to push out an upgrade. This method also works if you are running an older version of Windows 10 and would like to upgrade to a never version of Windows 10. The way to do this is rather easy, we basically need to perform the following steps:\n\n– Enable remote access for PowerShell\n\n– Copy the media down to the computer\n\n– Run a compatibility scan to verify that we can upgrade\n\n– Upgrade\n\nCreate a CSV file for computers that should be upgraded:\n\nFirst of all we need to create a .CSV file with the computers that should be upgraded, the file contains the 3 servers I would like to upgrade to Windows 10.\n\n\nContent of computers.txt\n\nStore the file in your computer, in my case I stored it in D:\\Upgrade2w10\\Computers.txt\n\nEnable remote access for PowerShell:\n\nWe need to access the computers using Remote PowerShell and therefor we need to enable that. This can be done using various method and one easy/weird/fun way to to that is to use WMI. The script below will connect using WMI and execute two commands on each server:\n\nThe following PowerShell script enables WinRM (Remote Access) and Remote PowerShell.\n\n\nContent of Invoke-ComputerPrep.ps1\n\nThe result after running the script is this:\n\nCopy the media down to the computer:\n\nNow when we have access to all the machine, we can copy the media down to each machine and we will do that in a reversed way. We will create a scheduled task on each Windows 7 machine and the scheduled task will then download the content to the local hard drive. You need to edit the settings in this file to match your environment.\n\n\nContent of Invoke-ImageDownload.ps1\n\nHere is how it looks when you run the script:\n\nRun a compatibility scan to verify that we can upgrade:\n\nOk, so we have the Windows 10 image in the C:\\Source folder of each computer, now lets run the Compat Scan.\n\nThe script will connect to each computer, create a plain vanilla .BAT file and then we will remotely execute that:\n\nAnd here is the result, as you can see all, none of the machines had any issues.\n\nUpgrade:\n\nOk, so the final step. The only thing we need to do is fire up the install program, and for that we use PsExec, it's old but works for this kind of work.\n\nThe script will connect to each machine, create a .BAT file and then we let PSExec execute it.\n\n\nContent of Invoke-ComputerUpgrade.ps1\n\nHere is the result of running that, as you can see all (you can only see Win-01) of the machines is returning a success (return code 0)\n\nOk, so, what next, well, since the return code was 0, lets restart them…\n\nThe scripts can be downloaded here: https://github.com/DeploymentBunny/Files/tree/master/Tools/MassUpgradeWindows10\n\n/mike"}
{"text": "New statistics from the ONS have revealed that women in the most deprived areas of England can expect to have 19 fewer years of healthy life than those in the most advantaged areas. For men, the figure isn't much better, with a gap of over 18 years. To put that into perspective, those born in the poorest parts of England can now expect to live the same, or fewer, healthy years as someone born in war-torn Liberia, Ethiopia or Rwanda. And a third of people in England won't reach 60 in good health.\n\nThe temptation, as always, is to assume that those at the bottom eat poorly, do little exercise, drink a lot and take drugs. In short, it's their fault. But 94% of people on low incomes don't take drugs, and people in the richest fifth are actually twice as likely to drink heavily than those in the poorest fifth. Inconvenient as this may be to some, there isn't some inherent character flaw that only afflicts the poor.\n\nAs researchers around the world have demonstrated many times, it is the financial gap between rich and poor that is significant, not their lifestyles.\n\nMore unequal societies are more stressful ones, where people are encouraged not just to \"get ahead\" but to claw their way past others while pulling the ladder up behind them. Back in 2009 we demonstrated in The Spirit Level that people in more unequal societies suffer more violence, less social mobility and trust each other less. Greater emphasis is placed on the individual at the expense of the wider community, with collaboration and the building of meaningful relationships rejected in favour of the pursuit of status. Social stress is why those at the bottom, or those with \"low status\" suffer most. But is it also why the rest of us also do worse than our peers in more equal countries.\n\nWhen The Spirit Level was published it was attacked by free-market fundamentalists who found the evidence to be at odds with their world view, in a similar way that evidence of anthropogenic climate change is attacked by \"sceptics\". But recently we have published a review of the extensive new research literature which shows strong evidence of causality. Inequality is not just vaguely linked to a range of health issues, it directly causes them.\n\nThe UK's extreme level of inequality, and the damage it does to our health and our society, is not accidental. In the late 20th century most developed countries experienced rising inequality, but in the UK this went further and faster than elsewhere. As a nation we made choices that exacerbated the situation, such as giving tax cuts to the richest at everyone else's expense. The UK adopted a culture of inequality, in which the rich are referred to in financial publications as \"talent\" or \"wealth creators\" but the rest of us are \"labour costs\" to be reduced rather than invested in. As if hard work and talent were confined to the super-rich, these terms are now used as a convenient excuse for pay far beyond the dreams of avarice. Work by the Equality Trust has even found that a FTSE 100 CEO is today paid on average 342 times that of a national minimum wage worker.\n\nThe inequality apologists and deniers can continue to bury their heads in the sand, but for the rest of us it is clear just how vital inequality reduction is for a healthier and happier society. The effects are lifelong. As we showed in a new study of child wellbeing, children in more equal societies do better on a wide range of measures, while as inequality increases, children suffer the consequences.\n\nPolitical parties with the population's wellbeing at heart need to make a commitment to greater equality. This isn't just good public policy, it would also reflect the wishes of voters. Eight out of 10 people say the income gap is too large, and the subject of poverty and inequality is now, according to Ipsos MORI, one of the five most important issues for the electorate, higher than education and schools.\n\nCommitting to reduce inequality could be a matter of victory or defeat for politicians, and it could, literally, be a matter of life and death for the rest of us."}

While listing the survivor's names and occupations, calling the Orlando mayor, and thanking the first responders for their efforts is sweet, it isn't going to stop the growing terrorist threat we face in the U.S.\n\nIt is the goal of the terrorists to attack anyone they believe to be apostates.\n\nHillary doesn't get that. She talks of unity and prayers, albeit important messages, but is unable to offer serious government action. While listing the survivor's names and occupations, calling the Orlando mayor, and thanking the first responders for their efforts is sweet, it isn't going to stop the growing terrorist threat we face in the U.S.\n\nThe Orlando attacker pledged his allegiance to the caliphate and it is clear that more people will do the same. Every American woman and man who acts Western are targets. Gays are not separate from this agenda. This is the real war on women. This is the real war on gays. This is a war on the West.\n\nAs Secretary of State Clinton missed this growing war with Islamic radicals. Her tenure as Barack Obama's lead diplomat saw the Arab Spring turn into the Islamic Awakening. And she was ill-equipped to stop it.\n\nShe failed to respond quickly and forcefully enough against ISIS when she was in charge, and that led to her presiding over the growth of ISIS and Boko Haram. It is troubling to hear her now support the exact same strategy we've been pushing for years with our 63 coalition partners – one that has failed to even take out the command and control center of ISIS.\n\nClinton also reacted to the terrorist attack in Orlando with the typical liberal political suggestion of more gun control policies. Her judgement during and after a crisis should be a serious concern for all Americans. She failed to see that the Orlando attacker not only went through a background check but had also been investigated by the FBI. If an FBI investigation isn't going to catch a terrorist before they act, then an increased background check is a weak and insufficient response.\n\nThe fact is that the FBI was suspicious of the Orlando attacker months ago. They were investigating him. But since he didn't have a prior arrest record, the politically correct mob demanded that law enforcement agencies leave him alone. Hillary has even mocked policies that push to follow Muslims on suspicions of threats. So while she calls for more action, she ridicules the very thing that could stop the attacks.\n\nHillary's call Monday to, \"keep the pressure on ramping up the air campaign, accelerating support for our friends fighting to take and hold ground, and pushing our partners in the region to do even more\" is a weak, stay-the-course response to a frightening trend.\n\nIn other words, she suggests we hug our neighbor and hope that others do something more.\n\nRichard Grenell is a Fox News Contributor.

In fact, she hasn't performed on American TV in more than two years. Her last performance in the U.S. was on \"American Idol\" on March 22 of that year.\n\nLana Del Rey Blasts Interviewer Over 'I Wish I Was Dead' Quote\n\nMeanwhile, Linkin Park is aiming to sell around 110,000 to 110,000 of its latest album, \"The Hunting Party.\" The band's last studio effort, 2012's \"Living Things,\" debuted at No. 1 with 223,000.\n\n\"The Hunting Party\" will mark the first studio album from the band to miss the No. 1 slot since their first album, 2000's \"Hybrid Theory,\" peaked at No. 2 in 2002. All four of their studio releases since -- along with a mash-ups collaborations effort with Jay Z -- have hit No. 1.\n\nIf sales projections hold, this week will be the first this year to see three albums each sell in excess of 100,000 copies. It last happened in the holiday frame ending Dec. 29, 2013. (The last time it occurred when sales weren't goosed by the Christmas shopping season was the week ending Oct. 6, 2013.)\n\nSam Smith, 'In the Lonely Hour': Track-by-Track Album Review\n\nAfter Del Rey, Smith and Linkin Park, look for country legend Willie Nelson to nab the fourth-largest debut on the chart. His new \"Band of Brothers\" album might sell around 35,000 or so, and should arrive in the top 10.\n\nJennifer Lopez will also debut with her latest, \"A.K.A.,\" selling perhaps 30,000. Deadmau5's \"while(1<2)\" could do 30,000 as well.\n\nOn SoundScan's Building chart (below), Del Rey, Smith, Linkin Park, deadmau5 and Lopez are Nos. 1-5, respectively. The Building tally is a precursor to the final Billboard 200 ranking -- reflecting the first four days (Monday through Thursday) of SoundScan's tracking week as reported by six major merchants.\n\nAs for the rest of the top 10 on the Building Chart: the soundtrack to \"Frozen\" is No. 6, Miranda Lambert's \"Platinum\" is No. 7 and the \"Now 50\" album is No. 8. Brantley Gilbert's \"Just As I Am\" holds down the No. 9 slot, while \"The Fault In Our Stars\" soundtrack is No. 10."}
{"text": "Donnie Wahlberg is showing some love for Waffle House … again.\n\nThe 47-year-old Blue Bloods star and New Kids on the Block singer made a stop at the popular chain restaurant in Charlotte, North Carolina late on Wednesday night — where he rewarded the staff with a $2,000 tip as well as front row tickets and backstage passes to his band's Total Package Tour.\n\n\"My mom waited tables, and my dad tended bars– for years!\" Wahlberg wrote on Instagram, captioning a photo of his $82.60 check and the Waffle House staff. \"So, when I walk into a #WaffleHouse, and the staff treats me like a king, you better believe I treat them like queens! Thanks to the team at @wafflehouseofficial Charlotte, NC!\"\n\n\nThis isn't the first time Wahlberg has shown his generosity for Waffle House employees. In late June, Wahlberg stopped in for a meal at the restaurant in Edgewood, Maryland and left the overnight staff a $500 tip — tweeting a photo with Waffle House staffers Tyler Spangler and Angi Silen, whom he called a \"great crew\" and thanked for their \"awesome service.\"\n\nOn Wednesday night, Wahlberg — who has been documenting his Waffle House meals around the country on social — also took to Facebook live, where he interacted with the staff and patrons while waiting for his order of steak, eggs, grits and bacon to arrive.\n\n\"This Waffle House is happening,\" he said, panning around the busy restaurant — his first stop in North Carolina after flying in from New York City, where he was filming Blue Bloods. \"We need to come to Charlotte more often. This Waffle House is love. Everyone's in a good mood in this Waffle House. Southern hospitality!\"\n\nRELATED: Celebrities Who Have Left Big Tips at Restaurants\n\n\"We're just going to have to invite this whole Waffle House to the concert tomorrow,\" he said, first passing verbal invitations to his waitress, named Chocolate. \"You going in the front row too!\"\n\nGreat crew at @WaffleHouse in Edgewater MD!

{"text": "Gwales Review \"The island, in spite of all our moves, was where we spent the most time, and most happily. It was where my parents always wanted to be whenever they were elsewhere. I felt I was a princess there; as if the whole island and everything on it was mine.\"\n\n\nIsland Child is an enchanting account of Ann Lockley's early years on the island of Skokholm with her parents Ronald and Doris (Do). Whilst many will be familiar with the writings of her well-known naturalist father, Ann's autobiography is an endeavour, as she writes in the introduction, to offer her own perspective on their island life. From her early childhood, she draws on her father's diaries, weaving in her own strong and detailed memories, and then goes on to give an account of her later life and her final settling on a farm in New Zealand with her husband.\n\n\nFor the first ten years of her life during the early 1930s, the family dwelt half on the island and half on the mainland. They also had a hut on the mainland at Martin's Haven and moved about to several other houses including one at Dale, Beggar's Reach, Cwmgloyne and Island Farm in north Pembrokeshire. Each abode provided fresh, creative (and not always successful!) opportunities for working on the land, the sea and with wildlife. Whilst describing her parents as 'incurable romantics', she also respects them as 'infinitely resourceful and tough'. This resourcefulness, resilience and passion for the natural world are qualities Ann inherits from them and their itinerant and unconventional family life. Whilst her early years in the company of island wildlife, ponies, goats, sheep, dogs and pet ravens might seem idyllic, she is never sentimental and is exposed to the cruelties of nature from an early age. On the same day her dearest goat Pinknose dies, she watches an oiled guillemot she cannot rescue, washed onto the rocks, 'Life on the island was a hard school'.\n\n\nWith the island, its colonies of birds and her notes made in a leather-bound book as her early experience of 'schooling', it's perhaps not surprising that her first experiences of conventional school are a trial. She copes with later experiences at boarding school with fortitude and includes some touching extracts from her letters home to her parents. With a Diploma in Dairying she travels to New Zealand in 1953 and goes on to buy a sheep and beef farm with husband Jack.\n\n\nHer account of the separation of her parents and the tensions around it is moving. Whilst their individual lives take them on different paths, both end up moving separately to New Zealand. Her mother builds a cottage on Ann's farm and her father settles permanently in Auckland in 1971. In New Zealand, she writes, 'they made friends with one another again...'. Upon their respective deaths, both their ashes are scattered back on the Pembrokeshire island of her childhood. It is a touching conclusion to her own story, 'Now they are together again on Skokholm. The full circle of their island life is complete'.\n\n\nA rich, deeply personal account, this autobiography also offers valuable insight into the pioneering conservation work taking place during unsettled times, with war looming. It will appeal, of course, to all lovers of the natural world and, more specifically, of the unique beauty of the Pembrokeshire coast and its islands.\n\n\nJane MacNamee\n\n\nIt is possible to use this review for promotional purposes, but the following acknowledgment should be included: A review from www.gwales.com, with the permission of the Welsh Books Council.\n\n\nGellir defnyddio'r adolygiad hwn at bwrpas hybu, ond gofynnir i chi gynnwys y gydnabyddiaeth ganlynol: Adolygiad oddi ar www.gwales.com, trwy ganiatâd Cyngor Llyfrau Cymru."}
{"text": "Carrot Production Facts\n\nThe carrot crop is Britain's major root vegetable, producing over 700,000 tonnes of carrots each year from 9,000 hectares.\n\nEach year 22 billion carrot seeds are sown in Britain, producing around 100 carrots per year for every member of the population.\n\nThe sales value of British carrots is around £290 million.\n\nFreshly harvested carrots are washed, packed and distributed to nearly every shop in the whole of Britain almost every day of the year.\n\nProduction Periods\n\nCarrots are harvested in Britain almost 12 months of the year using the natural climates in different parts of the country and using different techniques.\n\nEarly season carrots are sown in the winter and very early spring and protected with plastic or fleece covers. They are harvested from June through to August.\n\nGreen top carrots are sown in the open ground in spring and are harvested from August until the first frosts start to appear.\n\nStrawed carrots are sown in April to early June, and harvested from December through to late May. Straw is applied by machine in October until December to protect them from the winter weather and keep them dark as they attempt to grow in the spring.\n\nProduction Areas\n\nTraditionally carrots have been grown in the East of the country on the Norfolk Sands and the Fens region and up on the Lancaster peats. Over the years this has altered with Nottinghamshire and Scotland becoming important production areas.\n\nEach region has different qualities and climates and by using carrot-growing land all over the country all-year-round British production is achieved.\n\nEarly Production\n\nSuffolk, Norfolk and Cambridgeshire.\n\nGreen Top\n\nAll regions.\n\nStraw\n\nNottinghamshire.\n\nLate Straw\n\nScotland.\n\nAll areas can produce carrots throughout the season.\n\nProduction Methods\n\nAll carrots tend to be grown on free draining sands.\n\nA de-stoned or de-cloded tilth is required with a loose depth of soil which is usually 50-75 mm deeper than the required length of the carrot. This in practice means a depth of 250-300mm is required.\n\nDrilling with a suitable precision drill such as a Stanhay or Mini Air is essential to ensure maximum uniformity of the crop.\n\nThe drill is also set up to ensure differential between the outside rows of the bed and the middle rows of the bed with more seed placed on the outside rows in a 60/40 split. This may vary from site to site depending on the growers' experience and the intended market.\n\nThe use of cover crops is wide spread, with either barley or mustards used to prevent sand blow. These are usually drilled with the carrot seed depending on the potential risk of blowing.\n\nOnce drilled, conditions for rapid germination are required, this will often mean that there will be a requirement for irrigation or even better a shower of rain.\n\nIrrigation\n\nCarrots are a crop where irrigation is essential for maximum yield and quality. When you consider the soil type that carrots are grown in and the sheer weight of yield that is grown per hectare it is not difficult to see they have such high water requirements.\n\nApplication is usually overhead via hose reels, pivots and sprinkler lines. With the increased cost of water and energy, monitoring systems are essential.\n\nHarvesting\n\nThere are two basic harvesting systems in use, which have their different merits based on the crop and the time of year.\n\nTop lifters are used in the early part of the season when the foliage is strong and the carrots are very prone to breakages. They simply undercut and lift out the carrots by the foliage, which is then cut as it reaches the loading belt. During the summer this operation usually takes place at night avoiding the heat of the day and the carrots are lifted just prior to washing.\n\nShare Harvesters are used once the foliage is not strong enough to hold the carrot and as soon as the roots are strong enough to take the agitation of the web."}
{"text": "Character Aldenon Race Human Gender Male Class Mage Title The Wise Appearances Historical\n\n\nAldenon was an apostate mage and an advisor to Calenhad Theirin.\n\nInvolvement Edit\n\nAldenon hailed from the Frostback Mountains. He offered his services to Arl Tenedor the Elder, who accepted him as an advisor. He subsequently served under Arl Tenedor the Younger as well. The arling was at war with another one ruled by Arl Myrddin. During the siege of the West Hill, Tenedor the Younger was slain but his knight's squire, Calenhad, defeated Myrddin and became a Teyrn and ruler of Tenedor's lands. Aldenon was named Calenhad's chief advisor, and with his help Calenhad began to solidify the Fereldan nation.\n\nHowever Aldenon did not believe in the Maker, and this led to constant arguments with the pious Teyrn. When Calenhad was about to face the outnumbering forces of the last and most formidable foe, Teyrn Simeon of Denerim, Aldenon advised him to go to the Brecilian Forest so as to enlist the Ash Warriors. Calenhad followed the advice, but he also secretly contacted the Chantry and enlisted templars and Circle mages as well.\n\nAldenon was enraged. Before leaving he said:\n\nA civilization cannot be civil if it condones the slavery of another. And that is what this Circle is! But by accident of birth, those mages would be free to live, love, and die as they choose. The Circles will break—if it be one year, a decade, a century, or beyond. Tyrants always fall, and the downtrodden always strive for freedom!\"\n\nLady Shayna slew Simeon that day, and Calenhad was subsequently crowned king in Denerim. In the following years Aldenon led rebel mages who fought against the Circle Tower of Ferelden. When they were claimed one by one, he bade his apprentices to run. He was never heard from again.\n\nA legend says that when Calenhad disappeared, he sought out Marterel the Elusive, the only one of Aldenon's apprentices who was never captured, and persuaded him to disclose the location where his old master had gone. It remains unknown if Calenhad Theirin ever found Aldenon.\n\nSee also Edit\n\nAldenon's Vestments\n\nRequires: Level 17\n\n\nArmor: 307\n\n\n+4 magic\n\n+10 mana/stamina regeneration rate\n\n+16% fire damage\n\n+16% cold damage\n\n+16% electricity damage\n\n+16% nature damage\n\n+16% spirit damage\n\n+11% magic resistance Light chestpieceRequires: Level 17Armor: 307\n\nWillem's Bulwark\n\nOnyx\n\nRequires:\n\n\nArmor: 103\n\n\n+27 defense\n\n+X% magic resistance\n\nImproves with level-up ShieldsOnyxRequires: Weapon and Shield Armor: 103\n\nFreedom's Promise Staff\n\nAurum\n\n\nDamage: (1.7 + 1.85 * LVL) fire damage\n\n((1.36 * DMG) per second)\n\n+(10 + 0.25 * LVL)% fire damage\n\n+(10 + 0.25 * LVL)% cold damage\n\n+(10 + 0.25 * LVL)% electricity damage\n\n+(10 + 0.25 * LVL)% nature damage\n\n+(10 + 0.25 * LVL)% spirit damage\n\nImproves with level-up\n\n+(30%) damage vs. humans\n\nWisdom's Eye\n\nRequires: Level 13\n\n\nArmor: 72\n\n\n+1 magic\n\n+16 mana/stamina\n\n+41 attack\n\n+4 mana/stamina regeneration rate Light helmetRequires: Level 13Armor: 72"}
{"text": "We anthropomorphize the Cathedral as a person or a conspiracy. Such anthropomorphizing is a good approximation for corporations, since they make considerable efforts to make the approximation true – by concentrating all power in the CEO, and then delegating power from the CEO.\n\nHowever, the cathedral is rather a bunch of conspiracies, and its direction is determined by entropic forces akin to enthalpy, rather than a sinister and clever plan. To build a ruling coalition, divide power into bite sized morsels and distribute widely. Not a good plan for operating a functional organization. Mann is sovereign, and Mann is an idiot.\n\nIn Europe you go directly to jail for thought crimes. The US has the first amendment, so employs a workaround. If a business employs thought criminals, it has a \"hostile work environment\", so gets sued by social justice warriors, and has to pay them large sums, making thought criminals effectively unemployable, and social justice an obscenely lucrative career option.\n\nThis, however, does not work on open source, hence Gamergate is relatively successful. The Social Justice Warriors attempt to seize open source projects. Sometimes they seize them, and to their surprise destroy them, often they get pushback, which pushback they attribute to Gamergate and the Neoreaction. And indeed it is true, in that Gamergate and the Neoreaction is the think tank of the pushback, but what makes the pushback effective is the propensity of the revolution to devour its children, what makes the pushback effective is that leftists pretty soon start persecuting leftists for insufficient holiness, with the result that pious leftists find themselves, to their horror, deep shame, and great embarrassment, joining forces with Gamergate and the Neoreaction in self defense, as the Montagnards found themselves collaborating with the Dantonists.\n\nThere is always a state religion. There never was a golden age of freedom of speech and thought. However if you have many states with many state religions, and there is a lot of movement and communication between them, as in America before the civil war, then truth stands a chance, because if the gentleman from Massachusetts cannot say the truth, the gentleman from Virginia can say it, because before the Mormon War and the Civil War, the State of Virginia had a different and independent state religion from the state of Massachusetts.\n\nThe religion of Massachusets wound up conquering the US, and eventually the world, in large part because Virginia took religious freedom seriously, while Harvard and Massachusetts was unyieldingly and fanatically determined to extirpate it with fire and steel and still are unyieldingly and fanatically determined to extirpate it with fire and steel. When crazies and fanatics go up against moderate, compromising, and cynical cosmopolitans, the moderate and cynical cosmopolitans tend to get trampled.\n\nIf ever there was freedom from the state religion in a white state, that state was Virginia before the War between the States, and it did not end well.\n\nWe today have two problems: A single monolithic state religion, that since World War II has dominated the entire world, and a state religion with no archbishop and inquisition to keep the crazies in line. Kings put Bishops on the payroll to shut up the crazies. If you have a state religion controlled by the holiest, you get holiness spirals of ever more holy people\n\nHaving freedom would be the cure, but freedom within a single state is tricky, and, as we saw in Virginia, vulnerable to violence from the holy. Whites are prone to state religions. Asymmetric repression leads to movement ever leftwards. The state religion has to repress the excessively holy as well as the insufficiently holy, or it inevitably gets ever crazier.\n\nIf freedom for the insufficiently holy is hard to achieve, restricting the liberty of the excessively holy is easy to achieve.\n\nWhite nationalists tend to mistake repressing the excessively holy, controlling the priesthood, for controlling the Jews. Effective measures to keep the priesthood and the excessively holy in line would quite disproportionately affect Jews, but Jews as such are the wrong target."}
{"text": "The baking bug has bit my sister, Dom, and me. Weekends when she is in town we take the ideas we've been collecting in our time apart and eagerly start cooking little confections that we turn around and feed to the wonderful people in our lives. It feels a little like we're the Stepford Wives when we put the aprons on (I have some adorable ones) but I happen to think it is a ton of fun to just get girly and bake like we mean it.\n\nThis weekend had us making Dipped Graham Cracker cookies and Teddy Graham Cupcakes. Both of which were super easy. Since her and I do this mostly for fun we rarely do our recipes from scratch. Eventually we might progress that way but with our time limited we want to make the most of everything and just buy box mixes. Both of these treats took so little time to make and are really easy to personalize.\n\nSupplies for Dipped Graham Cracker Cookies:\n\n1. Graham Crackers\n\n2. Your choice of chocolate (we used milk and dark)\n\n3. Sprinkles or marshmallows\n\n4. Wax paper for drying\n\nSupplies for Teddy Graham Cupcakes:\n\n1. Teddy Graham cookies (we used two different flavors)\n\n2. Cupcake mix (we used a new kind by Betty Crocker called Fun-da-Middles that has icing in the center)\n\n3. Icing for the cupcakes\n\n4. Don't forget backing cups for easy removal once cupcakes are cooked!\n\nDipped Graham Cracker Cookies\n\nSteps for Dipped Graham Cracker Cookies:\n\n1. Melt your chocolate in a microwave safe bowl. Alternatively you can melt your chocolate in a sauce pan if you are going to be making a lot of these. We heated it up for about a minute until it was nice and runny.\n\n2. Break your graham crackers into smaller sections (or leave large for a bigger cookie) and dip it into the chocolate. Move it around a bit if needed to cover one end of the cracker.\n\n3. Lay dipped pieces onto the wax paper in rows, leaving room between each. After you get a few dipped, go back and add your sprinkles. This will ensure your chocolate doesn't harden before you can add the sprinkles. We also used little marshmallows.\n\n4. To quicken the hardening process we put our cookies on trays and set them in the fridge for ten minutes.\n\nAnd you're done! So simple and yet it makes a fun snack that isn't too rich. It goes great with some milk too! I recommend that you keep your cookies refrigerated until you want to serve them as it will keep the chocolate from getting soft in room temp.\n\nTeddy Graham Cupcakes\n\nSteps for Teddy Graham Cupcakes:\n\n1. Mix up your cupcake batter per the instructions on the box.\n\n2. If you are using the Betty Crocker Fun-da-Middles mix then fill your baking cups 1/3 of the way full.\n\n3. Knead the icing package about 20 times to soften it, then divide it among the cupcakes. About a tablespoon per cupcake should work. Make sure you put the icing in the middle. Once the icing has been added, cover with the remaining batter. Bake according to time listed on box.\n\n4. Now it's time to decorate! We used whipped icing and covered it with chocolate sprinkles and marshmallows. Finally, add your Teddy Grahams!\n\nWith the lighter, whipped icing these yummy confections weren't too rich; just the right amount of sweet!\n\nI am already thinking of ideas we can try for the next time she is in town. These projects have been some of my favorite. It is great way for us to spend time together and grow closer. Dom has the biggest sweet tooth I've seen in a human being and baking with her is just another connection between us. I treasure these moments."}
{"text": "From DISC Wiki\n\nThis is an ID format used by the game to identify systems and stellar bodies. The ID is represented as a 64-bit integer.\n\nFormat\n\nThe ID is effectively a structure, with different parts of the bitfield representing different aspects of the system's features.\n\nThese parts are:\n\nMass code (3 bits) - the mass code of the system, with a = 0 through to h = 7\n\n(3 bits) - the mass code of the system, with a = 0 through to h = 7 Z boxel (0-7 bits) - the Z boxel (within-sector) coordinate of the system\n\n(0-7 bits) - the Z boxel (within-sector) coordinate of the system Z sector (7 bits) - the Z sector coordinate of the system\n\n(7 bits) - the Z sector coordinate of the system Y boxel (0-7 bits) - the Y boxel (within-sector) coordinate of the system\n\n(0-7 bits) - the Y boxel (within-sector) coordinate of the system Y sector (6 bits) - the Y sector coordinate of the system\n\n(6 bits) - the Y sector coordinate of the system X boxel (0-7 bits) - the X boxel (within-sector) coordinate of the system\n\n(0-7 bits) - the X boxel (within-sector) coordinate of the system X sector (7 bits) - the X sector coordinate of the system\n\n(7 bits) - the X sector coordinate of the system N2 (11-32 bits) - the N2 number (within-boxel identifier) of the system\n\n(11-32 bits) - the N2 number (within-boxel identifier) of the system Body ID (9 bits) - the ID of the body within the system; for systems this is always 0 (representing the arrival star)\n\nNote that the X/Y/Z boxel coordinates and the N2 number have variable sizes; this is because the amount of space taken by these pieces of data is different depending on the mass code.\n\nThe following image shows the bitfield for each mass code:\n\nExample\n\nTake the system Eol Prou RS-T d3-94.\n\n\nFirst up, this system has a mass code of d, which is 3 in the bitfield. Additionally, we can immediately say that the body ID is 0, since this ID64 is just for a system.\n\nTo fill in more, we'll need to identify more about the system and the sector it's in.\n\nThe Eol Prou sector has an origin of [-10305, -1305, 19415], or in the internal galaxy coordinate space, [39680, 39680, 43520]. This puts it as sector [31, 31, 34].\n\nAdditionally, we know the system's N2 - it's the last number in the system name, 94.\n\nWe've almost got everything we need - but we still need the X, Y and Z boxel coordinates.\n\nThese can be found by interpreting the rest of the system name (Eol Prou RS-T d3-94); this comes out as boxel ID 66057, with coordinates [9, 4, 4].\n\nWe now have a full 64-bit identifier, which in binary is 0000000000000000000000101111000111111001011111010001000100100011, as an integer is 3238296097059, or in hex is 000002F1F97D1123.\n\nUse\n\nThe format first became visible with the release of E:D 2.2, as it is used in the VisitedStarsCache data file used to track which stars the player has visited.\n\nIt is also used when storing the current active route between game sessions; this is how the stellar body part at the top end of the ID was discovered (since you are able to set a route to planets/stations)."}

Sometimes it is enough just to be a girl.'\n\nIt comes after more than two hundred women reported being sexually assaulted by groups of mostly Arab or North African men in Cologne during the New Year celebrations.\n\nPolice say 553 criminal complaints have been filed, with about 45 per cent involving allegations of sexual offences, and most of the suspects identified so far are foreign nationals.\n\nThe attack have been seized by right-wing groups as evidence that chancellor Angela Merkel's open door policy is a failure.\n\nFinland and Sweden later issued warnings to women to be wary of the threat of sex attacks following fresh reports of sexual assaults in the last week,\n\nViennese police have also advised women not to go outside alone in Vienna.\n\nFurther cases have also emerged of similar attacks being reported in Switzerland, where six women claimed to have been victims in Zurich on New Year's Eve."}
{"text": "BEIJING, Oct 31 (Reuters) - China will dispatch an elite unit from the People's Liberation Army to help Ebola-hit Liberia, the Foreign Ministry said on Friday, responding to U.N. calls for a greater global effort to fight the deadly virus in West Africa.\n\nWashington has led the international drive to stop the spread of the disease that has killed nearly 5,000 people, sending thousands of troops and committing about $1 billion, but Beijing has faced criticism for not doing enough.\n\nThe PLA squad, which has experience from a 2002 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), will build a 100-bed treatment centre in Liberia, the first such facility in the three countries most impacted by Ebola to be constructed and run by a foreign country, said Lin Songtian, director general of the ministry's Department of African Affairs.\n\nThe centre will be open for operation in a month's time, he told a briefing in Beijing. China will also dispatch 480 PLA medical staff to treat Ebola patients, he said.\n\nIt's the first time China has deployed a whole unit of epidemic prevention forces and military medical staff abroad, Lin said.\n\nChina is Africa's biggest trade partner, tapping the continent's rich vein of resources to fuel its own economic growth over the past couple of decades. Some critics have rounded on Beijing for not helping more in Africa's hour of need.\n\nChina has so far donated 750 million yuan ($123 million) to 13 African countries and international organisations to combat Ebola, according to the government.\n\n\"China's assistance will not stop until the Ebola epidemic is eradicated in West Africa,\" Lin said.\n\nThe White House this week responded to criticism that as the global superpower it was not doing enough by taking a veiled swipe at the contributions of Russia and China.\n\n\"When we have a situation like this on the global scene, people aren't wondering what the Chinese are doing to respond to it. People aren't picking up the phone and wondering if Vladimir Putin is going to commit Russian resources to this effort,\" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told a media briefing.\n\n\"People want to know what the United States of America is doing about it.\"\n\nFOREIGN AID UNDER SPOTLIGHT\n\nChina said in July that more than half its foreign aid of over $14 billion went to Africa. In comparison, the United States spent about $46 billion in fiscal 2015 on foreign aid programmes.\n\nChina has also dispatched hundreds of aid workers to Africa to combat Ebola including health experts and medical staff.\n\nSihuan Pharmaceutical Holdings Group Ltd., a Chinese drug maker with military ties, has sent several thousand doses of an experimental Ebola drug to Africa and is planning clinical trials there.\n\nLin said several thousand Chinese nationals live in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and about a million Chinese nationals live on the African continent.\n\nU.S. and Chinese troops staged their first disaster relief exercise last November in a signal that China is increasingly eager to use its growing military muscle for humanitarian causes as it works to win international support.\n\nChina dispatched a state-of-the-art hospital ship to the Philippines last year after one of the world's biggest typhoons that killed thousands there.\n\nThe United Nations has called on foreign governments to ramp up efforts to help the Ebola-hit states of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, requesting they send hundreds more medical personnel to the impoverished states to help.\n\nForeign efforts have been complicated by public health policy issues at home. Some U.S. states have slapped mandatory quarantines on health workers returning from Ebola-hit states, while Australia this week imposed a blanket ban on visas from the three affected states.\n\nHealth experts have decried the measures as draconian, and say such policies may discourage badly needed foreign doctors and nurses from volunteering to help.\n\nMedical professionals say Ebola is difficult to catch and is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids from an infected person and is not transmitted by asymptomatic people. Ebola is not airborne. (Reporting by Megha Rajagopalan; Editing by Jeremy Laurence)"}
{"text": "Hi! Thanks for checking out our Kickstarter!\n\nWe are so excited to finally be gearing up to record the songs we've been writing and working on for the last year and a half!\n\nA BRIEF HISTORY OF - The Manx started off as a 3 piece all acoustic folk-punk band in 2010 (banjo, accordion, bass). We had all met while playing in the Los Angeles extreme punk/hardcore/experimental scene and decided to come together and try something different. Something simpler.\n\nIn 2011, we wrote a handful of songs, recorded our \"Storms Thrashing Our Vessel\" cd, and played a bunch of shows until the time that we met our mandolin player, Zach Zdziebko.\n\nIn 2012, we recorded our Blood Chronicles 7\" and did a little bit of West Coast touring to support the release.\n\nIn 2013, we set up a full United States tour all on our own. It was a challenge, it was grueling, it was a hell of a lot of gas money, but it was one of the most rewarding and exciting experiences we had ever been through. Later that year we added our drummer, Max Winston, to the equation. Having a drummer in the band really pushed us to another level and it was THEN that we decided that we would take all of 2014 off from playing shows, etc. to write our first full length album. That's just what we did and that brings us to right now.\n\nAdam is a Frog...\n\nSometimes the Shows Get Intense...\n\nA Basement in Pittsburgh...\n\nTHE NEW SOUNDS - Musically, we each come from different backgrounds, and we've all been writing, arranging, and contributing to this project, which has led us to create some really interesting sounds this time around. We've started playing through effects pedals and amplifiers using them to experiment with genres and styles, spanning from doo-wop to black metal to surf rock to math-core and beyond.\n\nOur music is inspired by, but not limited to, such themes as Ancient Egypt, Space, Killer Dolls, Puppets, Hell, Puppets From Hell, Puppet Master, Master Of Puppets, Spicy Ramen, Existentialism, Mortal Kombat 2, Killer Instinct, Extreme-Kendama and GWAR...\n\nRockin' the Suburbs...\n\nThe Manx + GWAR = THE GWANX...\n\nTHE RECORDING STUDIO - Instead of recording the songs ourselves, back in Tommy's cockroach infested apartment, we have a really amazing opportunity to record in an ACTUAL studio with a professional engineer/producer.\n\nSlick Studio Shot #1...\n\nOUR PRODUCER - Once we realized that we had written enough new material to finally record our first full length album, we reached out to a handful of producers and engineers, whom we respect and admire. We were excited to receive a response from one of our top choices, letting us know he was interested in working with us! He's worked with several of our favorite bands including The Melvins, Tweak Bird, Big Business, Solar Wimp, Foo Fighters, etc. Once we began to discuss the project with him, we realized just how perfect of a match he is for our unique sound.\n\nFloyd, Virginia...\n\nWHAT YOU'RE HELPING TO FUND - It's going to cost us $300 dollars a day to record our album. It will take us 10 days to record the entire thing.\n\n10 x $300 = $3,000.00\n\nMK2...\n\nREWARDS - We've got a ton of different options for you guys. Here are some pictures of a few of them!\n\nT-Shirts!!! Destroy Everything...\n\nThe audio from the complete MANX discography set to CRAZY visuals from weird, psychotic, funny movies, all on one limited edition VHS tape!\n\nCustom Myke Artwork!\n\nCustom Tommy Artwork!\n\nCustom Max Artwork!"}
{"text": "Photo\n\nDaniel Grayson is the associate director of undergraduate admissions at Tufts University in Medford, Mass.\n\nThe task, as colleges and universities around the country have assigned it, is to describe yourself in 500 words or less. Sum up all of who you are — your aspirations, perspective, strengths, intellect, personality, all of it — in one page, single spaced.\n\nHit the panic button.\n\nYou know what I do when faced with a problem? I ask the Internet. So do a Google search — I dare you — for the phrase \"admissions essay advice\" and see the mess you get.\n\nOne list on a prominent Web site includes the following suggestions (in order, with some paraphrasing): be cautious and then, immediately afterward, be controversial.\n\nO.K. Got it: Say something risky without taking chances. That's not helpful.\n\nNeither is the advice you get from most admissions officers when you ask them.\n\n\"Just be yourself,\" they say. Is there an alternative to that? Were you supposed to lie and pretend to be your smarter and more interesting older brother?\n\n\nHere are your deceptively complicated essay goals, as I see them:\n\nShow us how you think.\n\nTell us what matters to you.\n\nI'm not going to sugarcoat this: That is a really difficult task. It demands that you understand yourself in a way that perhaps no one has ever asked of you. It demands that you ask yourself questions perhaps no teacher has ever asked. Questions like:\n\nWhat invigorates/inspires/angers me?\n\nWhat do I wish we talked or learned about in school?\n\nWhat are my most strongly held opinions and where do they come from?\n\nWhat are the differences between how I see myself and how others see me?\n\nWhat pieces of my life transform my thinking (whether I want them to or not)?\n\nWhat ideas fire me up just when everyone else is cooling down?\n\nThese aren't easy questions. They are dangerous questions. They are questions with teeth, questions that require you to stake out a position, to have an opinion and to express something of substance.\n\nYou don't need to literally answer one of those questions to write a good admissions essay (though you could); think of the list as a set of examples.\n\nBeing honest and forceful about yourself may make some adults around you nervous; it's not \"safe.\" They will worry that you are being too controversial or informal. You should listen carefully and try to see your writing from their perspective. But you should feel comfortable ignoring advice that does not feel right.\n\nIf you are not interested in thinking about the big issues (or the small ones) around community service, here is some radical advice: Don't write about it.\n\nIf you love your sport, but it isn't what you are itching to talk about when you get out of bed, don't write about it.\n\nWriting about service or determination reflects important qualities, but no one in our applicant pools writes about how quickly they quit or how much they hate helping society. If you write the \"safe\" essay, how will you stand apart?\n\nI wrote of your goals, now here is ours: to build the most interesting and intellectually diverse class we can. We want to fill our seats with students who have things to say, who will challenge conventions and advance conversations, who will learn from each other.\n\nThe answers to those dangerous questions define who you are. They reflect what you value and how you think, as well as how you will enhance our community and classrooms. You need to be confident and proud enough to stand behind those ideas because if you won't, why would an admissions officer choose to stand behind you?\n\nAs a reader, I want to be in your corner, to fight for your cause in a hypercompetitive applicant pool. Can you fit all of who you are into 500 words? Of course not, but you can pick out a couple of important pieces.\n\nTell me what matters, and give me a reason to fight."}
{"text": "Doctors Nova Scotia says it's giving credit to the Nova Scotia Health Authority and Health Department for ongoing doctor recruitment efforts, but tackling the shortage will continue to be an uphill battle unless more attention is paid to retaining current physicians.\n\n\"This is a looming situation,\" said Nancy MacCready-Williams, the CEO of Doctors Nova Scotia, a professional and advocacy association that represents more than 3,500 physicians.\n\nFifty-five per cent of the organization's actively working members are over the age of 50, and she said retirements will continue to grow, especially if physicians are feeling disenfranchised.\n\nThere are physicians willing to practise into their senior years, she said, \"if some of the issues that prevent them from feeling supported and engaged on the ground were addressed.\"\n\n'Fragile and at risk'\n\nMacCready-Williams made the comments after provincial health officials updated MLAs at a legislature committee Wednesday on their recruiting efforts.\n\nShe pointed to a recent Doctors Nova Scotia report that described province's physician workforce as \"fragile and at risk,\" and which found doctors are feeling burned out just two years into their careers.\n\n\"Instead of adding physicians, Nova Scotia is struggling just to retain its current complement of physicians,\" the report said. \"It is challenging to recruit new physicians to the province, and increasingly difficult to get them to stay.\"\n\nOfficials with the health authority and Health Department have stressed the importance of strong community support when recruiting new doctors to the area. But the Doctors Nova Scotia report said health officials also need to rebuild trust so that new doctors won't face frustrated colleagues when they arrive.\n\nSo far this fiscal year, 26 new family physicians have started working in Nova Scotia, along with 66 new specialists. There are also 44 pending offers that the Nova Scotia Health Authority says just need to be ironed out.\n\nDr. Rick Gibson, Dr. Lynne Harrigan and Janet Knox of the Nova Scotia Health Authority on Wednesday addressed efforts to recruit more physicians. (Robert Short/CBC)\n\nThe issue of physician compensation also came up during Wednesday's meeting. Liberal MLA Gordon Wilson wanted to know if it was the only factor when it comes to recruiting and retaining staff.\n\nDr. Lynne Harrigan of the Nova Scotia Health Authority was quick to say it was not at the top of the list.\n\n\"When they've done national surveys, the first thing that comes up on the survey is the quality of the place where you're living,\" said Harrigan.\n\n\"The second thing that comes up is the community of physicians that you're working with. Compensation is way down the list. So in spite of it always being focused upon from physicians themselves, it is not the primary thing.\"\n\nMacCready-Williams disagrees. She said compensation is a significant factor in retention and family physicians in Nova Scotia are some of the lowest paid in the country.\n\n\"If they went to New Brunswick or P.E.I. they would make more, so that is a problem,\" she said. \"That is a problem when we are trying to be competitive in having a warm and welcoming environment, and we're competing with other provinces.\"\n\n'We're at a tipping point'\n\nShe also noted comments Harrigan made in an online video just a week earlier where she discussed an announcement about pay for hospitalists, one that will increase the disparity with family doctors.\n\n\"We have a system of payment that is inequitable,\" Harrigan said in the video. \"We have the lowest payment for psychiatrists in the country. It's no surprise that we have trouble recruiting psychiatrists in rural areas because of that issue. Our family physicians are amongst the lowest paid in the country.\"\n\nMacCready-Williams said that confirms a systemic issue that needs to be addressed.\n\n\"Right now we're at a tipping point, because many physicians' work-life environment right now is incredibly stressful. We have record rates of burnout and professional dissatisfaction,\" she said.\n\n\"In my six years in this role, I've never seen morale of our community at its lowest as it is right now.\""}

{"text": "ORLANDO, Fla. – Orlando City SC are close to revealing the location of their new USL team after narrowing their selection process down to a handful of sites.\n\nIt's the latest step as the Lions ramp up their plans for their own USL franchise, which was announced at the end of June. The team also announced the return of longtime stalwart Rob Valentino as assistant coach of the new team, whose name will also be revealed in the near future.\n\nThe possibility of adding a women's team under the Orlando City brand is also under consideration as the team looks to expand its footprint in Central Florida.\n\nCurrently, the choice of location remains in the Greater Orlando metro area. Recent reports have indicated the city of DeLand (40 miles to the north) and Melbourne (70 miles east) are among the front-runners, but other possibilities remain.\n\nBoth DeLand and Melbourne would fit the club's target model of being in City's overall catchment area while adding to their fan base. Both teams would also be able to train together at the Lions' extensive practice facility in nearby Seminole County.\n\nOn the coaching side, Valentino – who anchored the team's back four during Orlando's time in USL PRO from 2011-14 – will return from a year with USL's Arizona United to assist Anthony Pulis, son of West Bromwich Albion head coach Tony Pulis.\n\nPulis, 31, is thrilled to have the chance to parlay a well-traveled playing career into a chance to coach at the senior level straight away, and he is raring to go.\n\n\"These next two months will be the most challenging,\" he said. \"I am looking forward to everything involved but I will be really keen to get to the preseason and do what I feel I can do best, which is getting out there and coaching a team.\n\n\"I am currently spending hours going through video of various players. Ever since the team was announced, I've been getting recommendations from agents all over the world. Initially I get an idea of what these players can do and then I need to see if they fit our requirements. If they do tick the right boxes, I look at it further, going into their background and seeing if they might have the kind of character and team-bonding spirit we're also looking for, as I know from my own USL experience how important that is.\"\n\nPulis will have carte blanche to bring in a number of new faces, as well as taking some of the team's younger MLS players who are only on the fringe of the first XI, plus a handful of Academy players.\n\n\"We should have several Academy graduates in our group,\" Pulis confirmed. \"We are not as far along as some MLS teams like LA, Seattle and Portland in Academy terms, but I have spent a good bit of time with all age levels this year and have a good idea of the talent at hand.\n\n\"I have told the U-18s I will be watching a good few of them in training, and, if they look like they can perform at the next level, I will have no qualms whatsoever about bringing them up. You don't want to put any extra pressure on them just now, but there is definitely going to be an opportunity for some of them.\"\n\nPulis will also have no hesitation in tapping into an extra source of inside knowledge at regular intervals as he takes his first full coaching steps after a 13-year playing career in England and the US.\n\n\"Yes, I talk to dad on the phone a lot,\" he admitted. \"I would be foolish not to draw on that level of knowledge, get ideas from him and bounce ideas off him. The same is true of having Adrian [Heath] here, so I have two experienced coaches close at hand.\n\n\"I am very lucky that Orlando has exposed me to everything at the club and allowed me to learn from it. I finished playing last year and have been helping out at training sessions with everyone from the U-12s to the first team. I just can't wait to get going now.\""}
{"text": "At the time of this writing, I am keeping track of a whopping 42 brewing projects which are in the works within the boundaries of San Diego County. Of those, 35 are works-in-progress from new brewing companies. Some of them have been on my radar for a long time, so long that it's looking as though they should probably be removed. Today's column is devoted to entities that have put the word out that they are coming, but have yet to make good on that promise.\n\nTypically, when I reach out to future brewing company owners, they are fairly responsive. That said, it's not unheard-of for entrepreneurs to be tight-lipped or completely unresponsive. Not everybody's ready to talk and I respect that. But after months or even years of unrequited communiqués, I begin investigating businesses on my own. When those fact-finding missions are fruitless, companies get the dreaded yellow highlight in my Excel spreadsheet, meaning there's a high probability that the business was little more than a pipe dream that didn't survive the transition to real life or wasn't a serious project in the first place.\n\nLast August, a direct message from a mysterious, sci-fi-themed Twitter account informing me Orbit Brewing Company was coming to San Diego in late 2013. I messaged back and sent an email, but despite multiple outreach attempts, it would appear the pilots of the USS Brewery fell out of orbit. Despite coming on strong with images of tap handles, bottle caps, and apparel, they went radio silent from September on.\n\nSimilarly, Rule of Thumb Brewing Company sports some spiffy packaging designs on its Facebook page, but little else. They seem legit, and claim to be opening a small batch brewery in Encinitas (it would be the municipality's first) in early 2014, but some would argue early 2014 is over, with the first quarter in the books. They wouldn't be the first to suffer delays in reaching the finishing line, but Rule of Thumb has communicated little since asking followers on Facebook what their favorite Thanksgiving beers are last November.\n\nCrow Brewing Company is like a hybrid of Orbit and Rule of Thumb. That business set up a personal-style Facebook page and posted a good-looking IPA bottle design in February of last year. For a long time, nothing happened. Then, on June 3, boom — not one but two designs. One was a logo, the other a pint glass sporting that logo. Then, a business Facebook page went up and it was discovered that Crow is based and brewing in Orange County. Still, the company claimed allegiance to San Diego. In the midst of this identity crisis, the Facebook page went dark in August.\n\nNext up is Taproot Brewing Company, which appears to be an upcoming brewpub designed by a bunch of buddies up in San Marcos. Since they put up their website in 2010, three breweries have opened in San Marcos, with two other, much realer, works-in-progress coming closer than Taproot ever got. Their website goes so far as to list a half-dozen beers they produce, plus background on the owners, but the News section has never been populated, and they have yet to return a single inquiry. Add in the fact the company has zero social media presence and the writing is on the would-be brewpub wall.\n\nOf all the maybe-to-nevers, the one that appears to have the greatest chance of happening is a brewery that was planned to go in across the street from Newport Pizza & Ale House in Ocean Beach. That business was reported to be looking into going into the local beer business it has fostered for so long. It's certainly a cool idea, but not all concepts make it beyond that stage. And there's not a bit of shame in it.

{"text": "Jes Staley describes challenge as 'wholly manageable' and less costly than other problems the bank has encountered\n\nThe chief executive of Barclays has said he sees no reason to shift British jobs to Europe as a result of Brexit and described the restructuring required as straightforward compared with other challenges faced by the bank.\n\nJes Staley said Brexit would be \"a wholly manageable challenge\" and \"significantly less costly\" than other problems the bank had encountered.\n\nPreparing for Brexit, Staley said, was not as complex as setting up a US holding company, as required by the US authorities last year, or preparing to ring-fence Barclays' high street bank from its risky investment banking arm by 2019.\n\nShareholders should get a bigger say on executive pay, says IoD Read more\n\nHis remarks contrast with those of rivals such as Deutsche Bank which has warned 4,000 roles could go from London, while US bank JP Morgan is preparing to move up to 1,000 bankers out of the City to Dublin, Frankfurt and Luxembourg.\n\nGoldman Sachs, despite continuing to build a new headquarters in London, has said it will need more people in Madrid, Milan, Paris and other cities in the EU.\n\nSpeaking at Barclays' annual shareholder meeting in London, Staley said retaining the single market for financial services that currently exists within the EU remained the best option for the UK and EU economy.\n\n\nHe said the bank was prepared for any outcome, and that the bank had \"multiple choices\" on how it would continue to serve its customers and clients, regardless of the final deal.\n\nHe added: \"I have to say that compared to the complexity of standing up our US intermediate holding company, as we did on 1 July last year, let alone establishing a ringfenced bank in the UK from scratch, as we are currently doing, any of the options we might need to pursue are by comparison straightforward, and significantly less costly.\"\n\nStaley continued: \"Finally, we do not currently see a need in our options to shift British jobs or significant operations elsewhere. If we require a buildup of capability in another European Union jurisdiction as part of our plans then we can do so, and we will.\"\n\nBarclays has previously suggested its Dublin office could become more important after Brexit and it is thought that the bank will hire more staff in Ireland.\n\nAt the meeting shareholders raised questions about an investigation into Staley's attempts to unmask a whistleblower and one investor called on the American banker to resign.\n\nAnother asked what he had intended to do if had been successful in his attempts to uncover the identity of the individual who made allegations about the previous conduct of Tim Main, who worked with Staley at JP Morgan and who Staley recruited to Barclays in a senior role last June.\n\nStaley made two attempts to discover the identity of the individual making the allegations and began the meeting by apologising to shareholders for his actions, which he now says were a mistake.\n\nBoth the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority are investigating the matter. Barclays has formally reprimanded Staley and insisted that there will be a significant reduction in his bonus, which was £1.4m last year.\n\nJohn McFarlane, the Barclays chairman, repeatedly defended the chief executive who he hired in 2015 after forcing out previous chief executive Antony Jenkins.\n\n\nMcFarlane said Staley did not need to go. \"I don't believe that was the just action for what actually happened,\" the chairman said.\n\nOn the second occasion that Staley tried to discover the whistleblower's identity, McFarlane said \"he thought he had a green light. He went through the light and it actually it was red.\n\n\"The action for going through red light wrongly is you don't lose your licence.\"\n\nMcFarlane told the shareholder concerned about Staley's intentions if he had found the whistleblower: \"All he wanted to do and stop them sending the letters.\"\n\nShareholders have being advised to abstain from the annual vote to re-elect Staley to the board by ISS, an influential adviser to major investors."}
{"text": "Cheshire woman avoids jail in 2016 crash that killed Bethany man, 18 Cheshire woman was intoxicated when she struck teen, but it was not a 'contributing factor'\n\nNEW HAVEN >> A woman who was driving under the influence of alcohol when her car struck and killed a Bethany teenager on Christmas night 2015 has avoided prison time.\n\nBarbara Ann Ross of Cheshire, who was 60 at the time, struck Robert Weidig Jr., 18, on Route 69 in Bethany as he walked with a friend to a Christmas music-and-dance event.\n\nRoss was charged with illegally operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol and failure to drive in the proper lane. She pleaded no contest to the first charge.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Melanie Cradle imposed a sentence of six months, execution suspended, and eight months of probation on the first charge. The second charge was nolled.\n\nRoss was ordered to pay a $500 fine and make restitution of up to $8,000 for the Weidig family's funeral expenses. The other conditions of the sentence included requiring that she perform 100 hours of community service, attend a victim impact panel, undergo a substance-abuse evaluation and not drive until her suspended driver's license is restored by the state Department of Motor Vehicles.\n\nWhen reached for comment on the sentence, Supervisory Assistant State's Attorney David Strollo noted Ross had no previous criminal record. Strollo also quoted the Connecticut state trooper who investigated the collision saying that even a sober person could not have avoided hitting Weidig.\n\n\"Both a witness and the debris on the scene put him in the travel portion of the road,\" Strollo said.\n\n\"Cars were parked along the road; we don't know if that blocked her visibility because the cars were moved after it happened,\" Strollo said. \"A witness said they (Weidig and a friend) were walking in and out of the cars.\"\n\n\"There was no indication she was speeding,\" Strollo added.\n\nThe most important factor in the case's disposition, Strollo noted: \"I didn't find her intoxication was a contributing factor to his death. The state couldn't prove the intoxication caused his death beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nBut attorney James Nugent, who represents the victim's mother, Cindy Weidig, disputed Strollo's statement that Weidig was in the travel portion of the road when he was hit. Nugent made his comments outside of the courtroom.\n\n\"No one puts him in the travel portion of the road except the trooper,\" Nugent said. \"He says he must have been in the travel portion because she hit him. But the person Bobby was walking with says he was not in the travel portion. It's very upsetting that this allegation is made without any foundation for such a statement.\"\n\nNugent said the mother told the judge she did not want Ross to go to prison. \"Nor would it have been her son's desire to see Barbara Ross incarcerated,\" Nugent added. \"He was a loving, kind soul and he would forgive anyone.\"\n\nBut Nugent said he will file a civil lawsuit on behalf of the family against Ross.\n\n\"She made a horrible decision on Christmas Day: drinking and getting behind the wheel of a car and killing Bobby Weidig at the ripe age of 18 years young,\" Nugent said.\n\nNugent noted the burden of proof in a civil case is not as high as in a criminal one. He said he is confident he can show \"that had she been sober, Bobby would be alive today.\"\n\nRoss' attorney, Steven Walsh, said, \"It's a tragic situation for everybody involved. She (Ross) is devastated by it. Her heart goes out to his family and friends.\"\n\nWeidig's friends had circulated a petition calling for additional charges to be filed against Ross. The signers praised his character and noted he had suffered the death of his father in the year preceding his own death.\n\nCall Randall Beach at 203-680-9345."}
{"text": "When I write about the ritual infant circumcision of boys, I try to avoid lazy and crass comparisons to female genital mutilation. FGM, in the form of clitoridectomy (as commonly practised in countries like Somalia), is a horrific procedure that causes unfathomable pain and trauma at the time it is conducted, followed by lifelong sexual pain and dysfunction. There is no question that the physical impacts and health risks of FGM are genuinely incomparable to those of male circumcision, or to give it a less euphemistic description, ritual male genital mutilation.\n\nSo making trite comparisons between FGM and MGM is unhelpful and obscures differences. It is often unhelpful to even hint at comparisons. That is why I was appalled and repulsed by Lynne Featherstone MP, who at the Lib Dem Conference today used the exact inverse analogy to make a rhetorical point.:\n\n\"It's a practice that has been going 4,000 years and, without wishing to be crude about this, quite frankly if it was boys' willies that were being cut off without anaesthetic it wouldn't have lasted four minutes, let alone 4,000 years.\"\n\nI'm guessing that Featherstone has never sat in a court and listened to testimony describing an untrained practitioner taking a pair of kitchen scissors to the penis of a four-week old boy, without anaesthetic, dabbing it with olive oil and then leaving him to bleed to death. I have. When I read her words, the first image that flooded my mind were those vivid descriptions of the death of Goodluck Caubergs in Manchester last year.\n\nPerhaps Lynne Featherstone has never heard of Angelo Ofori-Mintah who died in London, aged 28 days, after a Rabbi told his parents to daub his uncongealed wound with Vaseline. He lost three quarters of his blood before he died of cardiac arrest. Perhaps she hasn't heard of the baby in Bristol who suffered a fractured skull after falling off a table during a home circumcision. She may not know that Manchester children's hospital treats an average of three babies a month with botched circumcision wounds, she may not know that 45% of babies circumcised at an Islamic school in Oxford suffered medical complications. She may not know that well over 100 baby boys die from complications after circumcision every year in the USA alone. While her eyes are on Somalia, she may have missed the story from South Africa where 30 boys died in one province alone during the \"circumcision season\", with another 300 hospitalised with dehydration, gangrene and septic wounds, at least ten of whom had to have their penises amputated.\n\nThe truth is that nobody has got a clue what the true global toll of death and injury from male circumcision might be, because global bodies such as the World Health Organisation make no efforts to find out. With around 30% of the world's baby boys being circumcised every year, many in countries with minimal medical care, it is likely to be in the tens of thousands at the least.\n\nYes, the probabilities of mortality or morbidity following female genital mutilation are certainly far higher. However the other side of that coin is that while FGM is prohibited and abhorred in all but a handful of cultures on earth, male circumcision is tolerated and encouraged. Around one in four baby boys born on the planet this year will be subjected to an unnecessary ritual mutilation, the overwhelming proportion of which will be carried out without anaesthetic and not under surgical conditions.\n\nFeatherstone said she didn't want to be \"crude\" and in that, I suspect she meant by using the word \"willies.\" Her crudeness is not in her vocabulary, it is in the grossly tasteless indifference and ignorance she shows to the fact that for 4,000 years we have indeed been taking knives to baby boys' willies, countless numbers have died as a result, innumerable more have suffered botched mutilations, sexual dysfunction, pain and suffering, and rather than \"putting a stop to it in four minutes\" we have turned our backs, averted our eyes to the blood, closed our ears to the screams and let it happen."}

{"text": "If you plan on living in the house during construction, this section is for you. If not, feel free to skip it:)\n\nSit down with your contractor and discuss the rules of your house. Be sure he/she understands the importance of these rules. Print them out. Post them all over your house.\n\n1. Staging the work. The way a construction project should occur while living in the house is staging the job such that there is always a liveable area of the house. This means that rooms under construction should be partitioned by a thick plastic barrier at the very least. This is especially important if your home was built before 1978, because of EPA lead paint testing requirements (Fulcrum Properties entirely ignored this one). Super thin painters' drop cloth grade plastic will not do the trick as we found out while working with Fulcrum. Vents should be covered such that dust is not traveling to different rooms all over the house. Although our kitchen was not under construction, this picture is how I found my stove many nights during the project. I would have to clean my kitchen over and over and over again. And this is not what we were promised. But that old scope of work didn't specify this, we had only discussed this at length verbally. Again, don't make this mistake.\n\n2. Wood floors need to be protected at the beginning of the job. Our floors were not covered until the very end stages of the project. Workman walked in the backyard with their dirty boots and construction debris and then walked right into our house. When moving furniture, the floors were not protected. We have huge three foot scratch marks where an armoire was moved. At the tail end of the project Fulcrum placed plastic on our stairs and paper on our floors, but that did little good. We've learned from other contractors that you need to place wood down on wood to truly protect it. In the end, we had to have our floors refinished, and trust me that it was a fight to have our contractor pay for it.\n\n3. Close and lock the doors. This may seem kind of silly, but we only bring it up because Fulcrum had a hard time with this one. I worked from home for quite a bit during the construction project, I had to get up every few minutes or what felt like every few minutes to close the door to the 30 degree winter weather outside. The workers just couldn't close doors after themselves, another indicator that they were used to working in vacant homes, not when a family lived in one. When I went into the office, I would come home to the doors unlocked and wide open, in the winter. And this was during a time where a string of robberies occurred in our neighborhood. I would be with my children and wonder. \"had I just been robbed, was I being robbed right now? Why were the doors wide open in the winter, much less unlocked?\" Not a contractor in sight.\n\n4. Protect your furniture. Fulcrum rarely protected our furniture and if they did, they used a painter grade thin plastic to do so. Because of this, we experienced damage to a cherished buffet, a chair from my childhood, a glass coffee table, and a vase from our wedding. This goes back to the idea of staging. So if construction will occur in a room, a contractor needs to let the owner know or prepare the room for the construction, but something needs to be communicated. We assumed, wrongly, that Fulcrum would protect our things that were too heavy for us to move. We moved most everything else out of the way, minus the vase. Be sure you are on the same page with your contractor on this one as much of the damage we experienced can't be repaired.\n\n5. Other. Microwave use, smoking, using the bathroom. Decide how you feel about contractors using your microwave, smoking in your yard and disposing of the butts on your lawn, using your bathroom. These are all personal choices that need to be communicated with your contractor. Again, this seems terribly silly doesn't it, but talk about it and put it in writing."}
{"text": "JOHN WATERS wrote tellingly in The Irish Times last Friday that he would personally find it difficult to discuss transubstantiation with his best friend, \"not because I have problems with the doctrine but because such matters are impossible to discuss in the language we use for politics, shopping and sex\".\n\nHis article carried the excellent headline: \"Belief in transubstantiation not a matter of yes or no\". In view of the celebration of the Eucharistic Congress, it is timely to consider for a moment a term that might be used unthinkingly and perhaps unwisely during the congress.\n\nWhen Richard Dawkins, the well-known evangelical atheist, instructs Catholics on the terms of their membership of their own church, it is time to sit up and take notice.\n\nSpeaking in Dublin last week, he remarked in his familiar and peremptory fashion: \"If they don't believe in transubstantiation then they are not Roman Catholics\" (The Irish Times last Thursday). So there, now you know: straight from the alternative magisterium.\n\nHardline conservative Catholics may be delighted to have such a distinguished ally. On further thought, however, they may be embarrassed to receive support from such a quarter.\n\nOne notices that Prof Dawkins, in his eagerness to discredit all religious belief, often sails into his task with an unwise disregard for the meaning and origin of a technical term like \"transubstantiation\", which is not to be found in the Bible, and was first used in the 11th century.\n\nRoman Catholics believe in the real presence of Jesus Christ in the Eucharist. \"Real presence\" is not synonymous with \"transubstantiation\" which would never have entered liturgical life had it not been seemingly prescribed by the Council of Trent in the 16th century.\n\nIn that age of religious strife, the term was used to differentiate aggressively between Roman Catholics and Protestants. In our own more ecumenical age, we try to dwell on what unites rather than divides us.\n\nLest heresy-hunters claim that I am not in conformity with church teaching, I quote the relevant words of the council: \"By the consecration of the bread and wine there takes place a change of the whole substance of the bread into the substance of the body of Christ our Lord and of the whole substance of the wine into the substance of his blood.\n\n\"This change the holy Catholic Church has fittingly and properly called transubstantiation.\"\n\nConsequently if we use the language of substance and accidents in treating of the Eucharist, we must follow the teaching of the Council of Trent, which simply states that the term \"transubstantiation\" was fittingly used by the church.\n\nSince, however, the church does not impose any philosophical system in the name of faith, we are under no obligation to use the term \"transubstantiation\" in discussion of the Eucharist.\n\nPope John XXIII, in his opening address to the second Vatican Council, made a hugely important distinction between the substance of faith and the manner of its formulation. Prof Dawkins cannot be expected to be aware of this distinction or indeed to appreciate its significance – but if he wishes to pontificate on the criteria for membership of the Roman Catholic Church, he might profitably do some study of critical theology.\n\nMuch ecumenical progress has been made on the Eucharist. It is illuminating to conclude with a short quotation from the magnificent Lima Statement of 1982, when more than 100 theologians from many churches in the world, Protestant and Catholic, met in Lima, Peru, and wrote an agreed document on the subjects of baptism, Eucharist and ministry which they sent for study to all their churches.\n\nFrom the statement on the Eucharist, these few words go to the heart of what the Eucharist means: \"The Eucharist thus signifies what the world is to become: an offering and hymn of praise to the Creator, a universal communion in the body of Christ, a kingdom of justice, love and peace in the Holy Spirit.\"\n\nFr Gabriel Daly is an Augustinian"}

{"text": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Commissioners in a Florida county are so tired of spending money on President Donald Trump's frequent visits to his Mar-a-Lago resort that some are suggesting a special tax be levied against the property if the federal government doesn't reimburse its costs.\n\nPalm Beach County spends more than $60,000 a day when the president visits, mostly for law enforcement overtime — almost $2 million since January. Sheriff Ric Bradshaw says the county was expected to spend $250,000 during Trump's recent meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, the president's sixth trip to his Winter White House in the 12 weeks since his inauguration.\n\nCounty Commissioner Dave Kerner has suggested turning Mar-a-Lago into a special taxing district and imposing a levy on the resort to pay the president's security costs. Because Mar-a-Lago is incorporated as a club, it pays lower property taxes than hotels. It also gets a tax break because Trump surrendered development rights after he purchased the property from the estate of cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post for $10 million in 1985.\n\nThe 500 members pay $14,000 annually in dues. The initiation fee was recently doubled to $200,000. Forbes Magazine estimates the club is now worth $150 million.\n\n\"We're very honored to have the president here, but at the same time, his travel here is such high frequency he's not visiting Palm Beach County — he's governing from it,\" Kerner told Money magazine recently. \"Whatever our priorities are, the taxpayers didn't pay this money to us to protect the president.\"\n\nKerner did not return numerous calls from The Associated Press to his office.\n\nThe sheriff believes the federal government will eventually reimburse the county, but can't be certain.\n\n\"I had a personal conversation with the president in February and he understands,\" Bradshaw said. \"There is a system in place and, unfortunately, that involves Congress … and that is not an easy thing to navigate through. I am sure they will get around to it.\"\n\nLocal governments aren't the only ones complaining. No solution has been found for the 28 business owners at Lantana Airport, a small field for propeller planes about 6 miles from Mar-a-Lago. The Secret Service shutters it every time Trump visits Mar-a-Lago because agents believe the 350 flights it handles daily pose a security risk.\n\nMarian Smith, who owns a flight school, says she has lost almost $100,000 because of the closures. A banner-towing company that operates from the airport says it has lost over $40,000 in contracts.\n\nJonathan Miller, the contractor who operates the county-owned airport, said this week that he believes a compromise will be worked out with the Secret Service, the Federal Aviation Administration and other agencies that would allow the airport to operate with restrictions during presidential visits.\n\n\"The FAA has a strong incentive to work with us and help get some funding that will put a system in place that will appease the Secret Service,\" Miller said.\n\nThe cost of Trump's visits divides local residents, with the schism often falling along political lines. Trump's supporters say any money spent by the county is recouped through added visitors lured by the frequent exposure and his visits show he cares about the area.\n\n\"The fact that he comes down here, the fact he is involved in the community to this extent even though he is the president, I think that's great,\" said Julian Detwiler, who operates produce stands at local farmers markets. \"There are costs associated with everything. It doesn't cost the country or the community more for him to (visit) than lots of other things we do. It keeps the economy going.\"\n\nThe president's critics say the visits illustrate his hypocrisy as he frequently slammed President Barack Obama's trips, even though they were less frequent and didn't burden any single community.\n\n\"Trump is costing this area so much money, a hell of a lot of money, and he doesn't seem to give a damn,\" said Bob Brink, a novelist and retired local journalist."}

{"text": "After his rise to power in 1933, Hitler led Germany on a mission of invasion and occupation. He had instilled into the country a desire for expansion in Europe, and in the years leading up to the Second World War, he expanded the army far beyond what was agreed in the Treaty of Versailles. This was the treaty which followed the end of the First World War – it caused Germany to undergo significant disarmament, and forbade the country from forming allegiances and invading other territories.\n\nThe Treaty of Versailles included some terms which many Germans considered unduly harsh, and bred a feeling of resentment in the German population. The fiscal depressions of the 1920s and early 30s caused almost all European economies to collapse, meaning that Germany was unable to pay the extortionate reparation fees that had been set in the Treaty, and other countries – in particular, the USA – began to act with more lenience towards Germany. As such, when Hitler rose to power and formed an alliance with Austria, thought this was also banned in the Treaty of Versailles, many other countries decided to overlook it, given how extreme the terms had been in the first place. Hitler took advantage of this, and by the middle of 1939, had occupied much of what was then Czechoslovakia, and had set his sights on Poland. It was the invasion of Poland which caused Britain to take action and declare war.\n\nIt is almost indisputable that the actions of the Nazi party – the then leaders of Germany – were the cause of the outbreak of the Second World War, but one can certainly argue that other events laid the foundations for those actions to have gone ahead, such as the uncompromising approach of the Treaty of Versailles, and the turn-the-other-cheek attitude of other countries in the early 1930s. If other countries had not been so lenient with Germany when, say, Hitler significantly expanded the army in 1935, then perhaps later events could have been avoided. The German population had immense confidence in Hitler – a charismatic leader who promised to right all the wrongs of the past twenty years. Had the USA, or Britain, or Russia, or France intervened at any earlier point, it is possible that Germany would not have been strong enough to hold off a foreign threat, and the confidence that German citizens had in the Hitler regime might have been diminished.\n\nOne can also argue that, had the terms of the Treaty of Versailles been less extreme, the German population might not have come to have been so passionately resentful of its treatment, and thus there would have been no need for the charismatic Hitler-figure to right all the wrongs. However, had the terms not been so harsh, it would have been easier for Germany to recover earlier, and perhaps Europe may have been thrown into a second war before it had sufficiently recovered from the first.\n\nThere are many 'if's and 'but's about history, and where the outbreak of war is concerned, it is often difficult to firmly determine where blame must be placed. However, it is widely agreed that Hitler and the Nazi regime was the driving force which led Europe into the Second World War. It certainly seems convincing that there were things other countries could have done to have at least attempted to stand in Hitler's way, but the German Fuhrer was set on a path of destruction, and it seems unlikely that much could have stopped him in his thirst for domination on the European stage. The question of who started the Second World War must, therefore, be answered with the blame being placed on Nazi Germany.\n\nLink/cite this page\n\nIf you use any of the content on this page in your own work, please use the code below to cite this page as the source of the content.\n\n<a href=\"https://worldwar2.org.uk/started-world-war-2\">Who Started World War 2?: https://worldwar2.org.uk</a> - WorldWar2.org.uk, November 2, 2013\n\nLink will appear as Who Started World War 2?: https://worldwar2.org.uk - WorldWar2.org.uk, November 2, 2013"}
{"text": "Even quicker byte count\n\n27 September 2016\n\nLast time, I thought I'd sped up line counting (which both xi-rope and ripgrep use) pretty good. I had two versions (one using POPCNT and being faster on newer machines, and one using old-fashioned bit-hacks running faster on older ones). Along comes the phenomenal Veedrac and sends a PR with a completely unsafe version that nonetheless not only works, but smokes every benchmark competitor by a factor of at least two.\n\nI've never been so happy for being beaten in a performance contest.\n\nVeedrac's code is a tour de force. Pointer arithmetic, array reduction, bit manipulation, you name it. Like my fastest version, it reduces the count in steps, but the highest step increment is a whopping 8K! Not only that, it manages to squeeze the intermediate count for those 8192 bytes into 4 usize s.\n\nNow, how does that work? There's actually a simple trick to it. Apart from using multiple usizes to keep intermediate counts, unlike my solution in words instead of bytes, which allows it to add more than 255 values and combining those counts only when the ~8k bytes have been screamed through. Hyper-screaming indeed.\n\nApart from using 4 counters in parallel (which complicates matters just a bit), the algorithm is as follows:\n\nPer usize, get the one-bits (via subtraction/masking, as my count did)\n\nCollect up to 255×8 one-bit values by simple addition\n\ncombine each two bytes into one short word by shift + mask + addition (this is how it looks like on 64 bit machines, on 32 bit machines, only half the size is used):\n\nbyte 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 bytecounts c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 c7 c8 hi masked >> 8 0 c1 0 c3 0 c5 0 c7 lo masked 0 c2 0 c4 0 c6 0 c8 added c1+c2 c3+c4 c5+c6 c7+c8\n\nNow we have four 16-bit entity per 64-bit word that carry numbers. Note that the number of each value is strictly less than 255 which means we can add two of them in a 16-bit half-word without overflow. This is exactly what the algorithm does (if the slice is large enough).\n\nfinally, the counts are reduced by our multiply + shift trick from last time, only that we multiply by a value that has one bit set per 16bit instead of per byte (it looks like 0x1000100010001 in hex on 32bit machines, and we get that number portably by dividing std::usize::MAX / 0xFFFF ):\n\nhalf-word b01 b23 b45 b67 multiplier 1 1 1 1 multiplied b01+b23+b45+b67 b23+b45+b67 b45+b67 b67 shift >> 48 0 0 0 b01+b23+b45+b67\n\n(for 32-bit architectures, we obviously only shift by 16)\n\nRemember we do this by four 64-bit words at once, so each loop iteration counts eight kilobytes. We could in theory save even more by doing the multiply-reduction only every 128 loops (because after that the counts could overflow), but the savings are probably negligible.\n\nSince not all slices are that big, we do another round for 1 kilobyte, sixtyfour bytes and finally single usize s (Note that on 32 bit machine, we need to half the numbers).\n\nIn conclusion: A clever way to use the available bits that I did not see before allowed Veedrac to amortize the count reductions with much more bytes counted. No wonder the code is faster.\n\nPS.: I tried reproducing this with much less unsafe code, but couldn't even get close. So the unsafe code stays for now. I have reviewed and tested the code and am confident it will run perfectly fine."}
{"text": "Preview | Recap\n\nPistons-Pacers Preview\n\nBy NOEY KUPCHAN\n\nPosted Jan 16 2015 9:57AM\n\nJust when it looked like the Detroit Pistons had turned things around, they took a big step back last time out.\n\nThe Indiana Pacers are also looking to regroup after letting what appeared to be a couple of easy matchups get away.\n\nDetroit tries to avoid losing two in a row for the first time in almost four weeks as it visits Indiana, where the Pistons have badly struggled but enter Friday night seeking their longest road winning streak in nearly 13 years.\n\nThe Pistons scored 94.4 points per game in opening 5-23, but they've averaged 105.8 in winning nine of 11 since releasing Josh Smith - with the first of those victories coming 119-109 over Indiana on Dec. 26. Detroit (14-25), however, reverted to its old ways in Wednesday's 105-94 loss to a last-place New Orleans team.\n\nEn route to their lowest point total in 14 games, the Pistons were outscored 58-36 in the first half and trailed by double digits throughout the second. Detroit was outrebounded 47-30, its worst effort on the glass this season.\n\n\"That was a bad performance, and we have to make sure it stops tonight,\" coach Stan Van Gundy said. \"We didn't do anything. We didn't rebound and we didn't protect the paint, which were two big areas of emphasis. We brought absolutely no energy whatsoever to the game.\"\n\nThe Pistons haven't dropped back-to-back games since Dec. 19 and 21.\n\nThey could like their chances of extending that streak on the road, where they've won six in a row for the first time since March 2007. Detroit hasn't put together seven consecutive road victories since Jan. 18-Feb. 22, 2002.\n\n\"We're always a little bit worse at home and we have been all year,\" Van Gundy said. \"Even during the 5-23 stretch we were better on the road. I don't know what that's all about, but we are a much more energetic team on the road than we are at home.\"\n\nThey haven't enjoyed much success in Indianapolis, however. Detroit has lost 11 of its past 12 visits, with the last three defeats coming by an average of 19.3 points.\n\nThe bulk of those games, though, came against Pacers teams which finished first or second in the Central Division. The loser of this matchup will be alone in the Central basement.\n\nIndiana (15-25) had won four of five at home - its best stretch there this season - before falling 110-101 to Western Conference-worst Minnesota on Tuesday. The Pacers were outscored 41-26 in the fourth quarter as the Timberwolves snapped a 15-game losing streak behind Mo Williams' career-high 52 points.\n\nIndiana had been coming off a 93-92 loss at lowly Philadelphia three nights earlier.\n\n\"It's no fun losing to teams with poor records. It's no fun. But it's a long season,\" coach Frank Vogel said. \"We believe in what we do. We believe in who we have in the locker room.\"\n\nC.J. Miles scored 22 points against Minnesota and is averaging 19.4 over his last seven home games. He started in place of former Pistons guard Rodney Stuckey, who finished with 13 points while battling food poisoning.\n\nStuckey scored nine in his first matchup against his former team last month. Andre Drummond had 20 points, Greg Monroe added 19 with 15 rebounds and Brandon Jennings scored 14 to go with 10 assists as Detroit shot a season-high 54.7 percent.\n\nJennings is averaging 22.3 points over an eight-game stretch, but he's been limited to 12.4 per game and 28.3 percent shooting in his last seven against the Pacers.\n\nGeorge Hill remains out for Indiana with a strained groin.\n\nCopyright 2015 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

{"text": "Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker is fond of pointing out that he was voted into office based on his promise to take on state employee union collective bargaining rights so that he could get on with balancing the state's budget.\n\nIndeed, shortly after introducing his controversial 'beat down' of collective bargaining in the Badger State, Walker claimed that nobody should have been surprised by his actions because he had campaigned on the issue.\n\nWe introduced a measure last week, a measure I ran on during the campaign, a measure I talked about in November during the transition, a measure I talked about in December when we fought off the employee contracts, an idea I talked about in the inauguration, an idea I talked about in the state of the state. If anyone doesn't know what's coming, they've been asleep for the past two years. Via Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nWhile there have been continuing efforts to show that Scott Walker never did reveal his plans for collective bargaining in the state during the campaign, definitive proof has now emerged via a video tape of Candidate Walker being interviewed by the editorial board of the Oshkosh Northwestern— just one week before the election.\n\nThe smoking gun video was recently unearthed by Judd Lounsbury, and published on his Uppity Wisconsin blog, and reveals that Scott Walker was singing quite a different tune before winning his gubernatorial race. While you can watch the entire video at the Uppity Wisconsin website—and I recommend you do so—here is the relevant dialogue which takes place at 7:50 into the conversation -\n\nEditorial Board Member: Before, we were talking about state employees contributing to their plan, paying their share of the pension plan. Collective bargaining come into that? Walker: Yep (nodding yes) Editorial Board Member: How do you get that negotiated and accepted by the state employee unions? Walker: You still have to negotiate it. I did that at the county as well.\n\nWalker went on to indicate that he was willing to work with the unions, pointing out that he had used furloughs as a bargaining tool when negotiating with unions as Milwaukee County Executive and that he would \"approach a similar strategy for the state.\" Walker further noted that he was open to compromise and that if the unions had ideas as to how to save money, he would be willing to explore what they might have to say.\n\nSounds reasonable to me—except that it turns out that Governor Walker had no interest whatsoever in what the unions had to say. In fact, we know that the state employees' unions attempted to agree with Walker's proposals to modify their collective bargaining agreements before the Governor introduced his legislation placing severe limits on collective bargaining.\n\nSo, Governor Walker fibbed. The question now is will Wisconsin voters care?\n\nWhile it seems difficult to ignore that Walker very much sought to mislead Wisconsin voters on a very important issue, there remains considerable support for his anti-collective bargaining position in Wisconsin. Still, polls reveal that a majority of Wisconsinites disapprove of Walker's anti-collective bargaining stance, calling into question whether or not the Governor would have emerged victorious in his race had he been more forthright with the voters of his state.\n\nCertainly, Governor Walker is not the first politician to fudge the truth during an election. There are ample examples on both sides of the political divide where dishonest campaigning is the norm.\n\nBut will Wisconsin voters punish their governor for putting his state through the political turmoil that might have been avoided had he warned them of his plans? According to the most recent PPP survey, while Walker's approval numbers in his state are upside down — 52 percent voice disapproval with their controversial governor— he fares better on the question of returning him to office. His fate, however, remains a toss up with 49 percent of Wisconsinites saying he should stay and 49 percent saying he should go.\n\nClearly, this is going to be a very interesting election and I cannot imagine a better opportunity for voters to voice the opinion that we would prefer our candidates to be honest about their plans before we elect them to office rather than surprise us after they've got the job.\n\ncontact Rick at thepolicypage@gmail.com\n\nTwitter @rickungar"}

Law societies in both provinces voted against licensing the graduates, calling the school discriminatory. B.C.'s Court of Appeal overturned one such rejection, while Ontario's top court upheld the other.\n\nOntario is the only government intervening in the case. In all, a record 26 intervenors are scheduled to appear, after the court added a day for the hearing, and in an unprecedented move granted permission to 17 intervenors it had earlier rejected.\n\nIn its legal filing, Trinity Western says the law societies are discriminating against its graduates on the grounds of religious freedom. Such discrimination, it says, harms all religious minorities by forbidding them from joining together to express their beliefs.\n\nBarring its graduates \"removes the option for members of the evangelical community to attend a law school that respects, encourages and supports their beliefs.\"\n\nIf the law societies are correct in refusing to recognize Trinity Western, the school says, \"the Charter [of Rights and Freedoms] does not adequately protect the ability of all religious educational communities-schools, churches and other organizations to obtain required state approvals and recognition to carry out their private activities in the context of their protected religious beliefs.\"\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nTWU was established by the Evangelical Free Church, and describes evangelicals as a distinct religious subculture in Canada, amounting to 11 per cent or 12 per cent of the population.\n\n\"Evangelical Christianity is a minority religious group, having distinctive religious beliefs, including an emphasis on practising the beliefs and moral standards expressed in the Bible.

Depending on how a draft is progressing, I will draft either one high upside running back in Round 4 or 5, or I will draft none at all. My preferred lineup after five rounds is to own one tight end (Graham/Gronk) and four wide receivers. I then focus on selecting potential breakout players, the receiving back in timeshares, and backups in good offenses.\n\nYou read that right: you don't draft a running back until the fifth or sixth round. That means no LeSean McCoy. No Marshawn Lynch. Not even Reggie Bush or Alfred Morris. None.\n\nThe point of the strategy is to lessen the risk of drafting running backs early in the draft so that you can capitalize on elite wide receivers and tight ends in the those rounds. It sounds wacky, but the historical numbers support it.\n\nJust look at last year for a recent example. Here are how the highest-picked running backs fared in terms of fantasy points.\n\nThree of the first four picks were busts (defined here as failing to score at least two thirds of the points for an average player at the same position taken in that round), as were Ray Rice and Trent Richardson. That's five of the first 12 running backs taken.\n\nOver the last three years, 12 of the 45 running backs drafted in the first two rounds were busts. Four of the 13 running backs taken with the first six picks in the first round were also busts, which likely means that one of LeSean McCoy, Jamaal Charles, Adrian Peterson, Matt Forte and Eddie Lacy will disappoint an owner in the upcoming season.\n\nWide receivers, on the other hand, were a bust just three out of the 17 times they were drafted in the first two rounds over that same time span: Andre Johnson in 2011, Larry Fitzgerald in 2012 and Julio Jones in 2013.\n\nFor Zero RB to be successful, you need to target running backs with upside. Here are three running backs projected to be available in the later rounds who could help make this strategy successful:\n\nDevonta Freeman, Atlanta Falcons\n\nFreeman was selected in the fourth round of the 2014 NFL draft and is behind a 31-year-old Steven Jackson on the depth chart. Falcons offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter cautions that Freeman is \"going to go through some growing pains,\" but the upside is the youngster rushed 404 times for 2,255 yards and 30 touchdowns over three seasons at Florida State.\n\nStevan Ridley, New England Patriots\n\nThe expectations for Ridley were high last season after he tallied 1,263 rushing yards and 12 rushing touchdowns in 2012, but he failed to meet them. With just 773 yards and seven touchdowns in 2013, he is now a late sixth-round pick in mock drafts. However, when given his opportunities in the preseason, Ridley has run hard and held onto the ball.\n\nDeAngelo Williams, Carolina Panthers\n\nWilliams had 201 rushing attempts for 843 yards and added 333 receiving yards last season, when he scored four total touchdowns. That was good the 19th-most receiving yards for a running back, and he was just outside the top 20 in terms of scoring for running backs in standard scoring leagues. Four of Carolina's top receivers are gone, so there should be an increased emphasis on the running game.\n\nFantasy football requires luck to be successful, and this crazy strategy may just be crazy enough to work.\n\nMore Fantasy Football\n\n2014 Fantasy Draft Home | Cheat Sheet | Mock Draft Analysis\n\nPositional Rankings: Top 30 QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | Ks | DEF\n\nDraft Talent Tiers: QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs\n\nFancy Stats Value Players: QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs"}
{"text": "If anybody was going to catch the mumps, naturally it'd be Keith Ballard.\n\nThe defenseman's run of bad luck with injuries and now illness has been nonstop since he signed with the Wild before last season.\n\nBallard missed his seventh consecutive game Tuesday since becoming ill the week of Oct.19. As it turns out, Ballard might have had the mumps. Some of his test results were positive, some negative.\n\n\"I've asked my mom and she said I had the vaccine [as a kid], so it makes no sense,\" Ballard said. \"So that's the hard part [team doctors] are trying to wrap their heads around. How would I have gotten it?\"\n\nWhen Ballard and rookie defenseman Christian Folin became ill at the same time, the symptoms included swollen jaws — a classic mumps symptom. At the same time, several St. Louis Blues also were ill. Because both teams were in California around the same time, team trainers from both consulted and the Wild learned some Blues players tested positive for the mumps virus.\n\nBallard and Folin were immediately sent for tests; Folin's was negative. He missed five games and returned Saturday against Dallas.\n\n\"I had lots of flu symptoms — achy, fever, weak, zero energy,\" Ballard said. \"Some days, even if I went out to run an errand, I was wiped out. I'd come home and lay down for three hours. I've been going to bed around 6 or 8 p.m., sleep for 12 hours and wake up exhausted. It was awful.\"\n\nBallard has practiced the past few days, is slowly regaining energy and feels he's on the upswing. He plans to be on the upcoming road trip to Ottawa, Montreal and New Jersey \"unless maybe I get sick again,\" he said, only half-sarcastically.\n\nIt's been a tough year-plus for Ballard, the former Gophers two-time national champion and Baudette, Minn., native. He missed 30 games last season because of two concussions, broken ribs and a sports hernia. Now, maybe the mumps.\n\n\"They kind of add up. It's like, 'Again,'\" said Ballard, 31. \"I've been injured a bunch the last year. It doesn't get me down to the point where I'm miserable, but it's frustrating not being able to play, watching games because it looks so fun out there.\"\n\nIt's especially been frustrating because the Wild already has seen Jonas Brodin and Jared Spurgeon suffer injuries, so there would have been an opportunity for Ballard to play consistently. Nate Prosser, picked off waivers before the season, has been a tremendous insurance policy and played his eighth consecutive game Tuesday.\n\n\"But it's a long year,\" Ballard said. \"Lots of games left. That's why the mental part is so important. You can't be so down and out. I've been around long enough to understand that for the team to go a long way, you need to use your depth.\"\n\nHaula vs. Malkin\n\nTuesday's game against Pittsburgh was Wild center Erik Haula's first game against Penguins star Evgeni Malkin since Malkin broke Haula's jaw on their first shift of the world championship title game between Russia and Finland in May.\n\n\"When you get a stick in someone's face, I think it's a dirty play, but I don't think it was intentional,\" Haula said. \"I think he was protecting himself from my check and his reaction was to lift his stick. I skated right into it.\"\n\nHaula knew right away he was in dire straits because he barely could talk. But he put on a full face shield and played the rest of the game (Russia won gold).\n\nLuckily for Haula, he didn't need surgery: \"It was a clean break, but I didn't have to start my summer getting screws. Just ate soft foods.\"\n\nEtc.\n\n•Center Ryan Carter (upper-body) returned Tuesday and Stephane Veilleux was scratched."}

The Liberals also committed to protecting 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas by 2020, under the International Convention on Biodiversity.\n\nThe red squares on this map indicate where Shell Canada had oil and gas exploration permits. The company has agreed to hand those permits over to the Nature Conservancy of Canada in a move to help marine conservation efforts in the Arctic. (Nature Conservancy of Canada)\n\n\"This really paves the way for an open dialogue for how big to make the national marine protected area, and the establishment of it,\" said John Lounds, president of the Nature Conservancy of Canada.\n\n\"What this does is allow for the expansion of the area without any kind of worry about whether the permits would continue to exist, and going through all of that.\"\n\nPermits' validity questioned\n\nShell's permits recently came under scrutiny when the World Wildlife Fund filed a lawsuit in Federal Court in April, demanding the permits be declared invalid. The organization argued the permits expired in 1979 and were never renewed.\n\nShell Canada's president and country chair Michael Crothers said his company was in talks with the federal government about handing over the permits well before the lawsuit was filed, and reached out to WWF-Canada after the lawsuit made headlines.\n\n\"In speaking with [WWF-Canada president] David Miller, we were able to align in a common goal here,\" Crothers said.\n\n\"He wasn't aware we were speaking with the government and with [the Nature Conservancy of Canada] about these permits and contributing them.\"\n\nHe said the lawsuit didn't affect Shell's timeline for relinquishing the permits.\n\n\"I think our announcement [today] on Oceans Day, hosted by WWF, shows great alignment. It's about collaboration and working together across different sectors.\"\n\nGreenpeace said in March that minutes from a 2014 Shell meeting in Calgary showed the company would \"need to get something back in return\" for the permits.\n\nCrothers told CBC News that Shell isn't receiving any compensation for donating its permits.\n\n\"This area has really special value in terms of its ecological nature, so we think it's terrific we can work with NCC and the government to make this happen,\" Crothers said.\n\n\"We're really hopeful that in a short few months, this will be part of an expanded Baffin Bay and Lancaster Sound marine conservancy.\"\n\nNarwhal, whales and seals\n\nLocated at the east entrance to the Northwest Passage, Lancaster Sound is one of the richest marine mammal areas in the world, according to Parks Canada.\n\nLast month, WWF-Canada created an interactive map of the area to highlight its need for protection.\n\nIt's estimated that 75 per cent of the world's narwhals spend summer in Lancaster Sound, as well as large numbers of seals, beluga and bowhead whales.\n\nA national marine conservation area proposal for Lancaster Sound was first prepared in 1987. In 2009, the federal government launched a $5-million feasibility study for a national marine conservation area. Today, there's no formal marine protection in the area.\n\nOfficials say the next steps will be to consult with Inuit groups, local communities in the area and the government of Nunavut to work out agreements on exactly how much of the area to protect."}

She was transported to a nearby hospital, where she later died.\n\nPolice say a 25-year-old man was also shot in the shoulder. He was taken to the hospital in serious condition and is expected to survive.\n\nShortly after the shooting, police say they were able to locate and arrest 29-year-old Dane Salanoa for investigation of robbery. He was later released pending investigation,\n\nA second suspect, 30-year-old Alabanza Tuimaleali'ifano, was arrested Saturday night. As of Monday afternoon, he was charged for manslaughter, attempted murder and other firearms charges. His bail is set at $1 million.\n\nCourt records show Tuimaleali'ifano was also arrested in May for carrying a replica gun in a public place, but posted bail.\n\nMeanwhile, undercover Honolulu police officers raided Cuties Cafe on Saturday morning, seizing at least 12 illegal gambling machines.\n\nBarry Wagenvoord, who works nearby, says he's seen suspicious activity at the business for some time.\n\n\"That café place has been sketchy for a while,\" he said. \"When they first opened up, they specialized with waitresses in lingerie and that seemed to stop for a while.\"\n\nWendy Khoang owns N.K.

He says he worked many game room raids before retiring in 1993.\n\nLui says there are actually less now than there were in the mid 1980's, but the way they operate has changed over the years. Lui says instead of a few people owning multiple, large operations, he says, there are a lot of smaller ones now, often run by individuals. He says that makes it harder for law enforcement to devote resources because it isn't often cost effective. \"You need undercover officers,\" he says, \"Then you need to seize the devices and the monies you get.\"\n\n\"It's not easy getting in there, they have that little security camera,\" says defense attorney David Hayakawa, \"They have to buzz you in.\" He says new customers need to be brought in by known players, and undercover officers can have a hard time even getting their foot in the door. Hayakawa says Honolulu police and prosecutors do try, but even after a bust, the operation will often reopen somewhere else shortly after.\n\n\"I have always asserted that gambling is connected to dangerous criminal activity, and this shooting is an example of that.\" Honolulu Prosecuting Attorney Keith Kaneshiro told Hawaii News Now in a statement.\n\nThe Honolulu Police Department also sent us a statement saying they have executed more than a dozen search warrants this year on suspected game rooms.\n\nCopyright 2016 Hawaii News Now.

{"text": "SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria's nationalist Attack party will work to topple the government if Sofia backs a new round of Western sanctions against Russia over its annexation of Crimea, the party's leader told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.\n\nLeader of Bulgarian nationalist Attack party Volen Siderov (R) arrives at Sofia's investigative service building March 12, 2014. REUTERS/Stoyan Nenov\n\nAttack holds the balance of power in the Bulgarian parliament, and its threat is an extreme example of the domestic pressures European governments face in taking a position on the worst crisis in East-West relations since the Cold War.\n\nIf the party pulls the plug on Prime Minister Plamen Oresharski's minority coalition government, it could tip the European Union's poorest member state back into political instability. Months of street protests felled one government last year and almost toppled its successor, at a time when the country was struggling to revive economic growth.\n\nBulgarian leaders' position in relation to the Ukraine crisis is especially precarious. On the one hand, the country has pushed for closer ties with the EU bloc, which it joined seven years ago. On the other hand, it is almost entirely dependent on Russian energy supplies, and many Bulgarians feel a deep affinity for their giant neighbour across the Black Sea.\n\nAttack, which is a noisy critic of the United States and Bulgaria's NATO membership, is the only Bulgarian party to openly champion Russia's intervention in the Ukraine.\n\n\"If the current Bulgarian government supports them (tougher sanctions), I will take a firm opposition line towards it and I will work for its toppling,\" party chairman Volen Siderov said in an interview in his office in the Bulgarian capital.\n\n\"Then we will have to ask ourselves the question what government and what majority will come after it, whether it will\n\nbe the same, or whether it can be changed,\" he said.\n\n\"It is a problem for the voters, who have to wake up and finally understand that the government in Bulgaria should have an independent policy and put an end to colonialism that we have been forced into.\"\n\nAs if to underscore Bulgarian ties to Russia, Siderov has antique guns and swords fixed on his office wall - some of them relics of Russia's wars against Turkey in the 19th century that helped Bulgaria throw off 500 years of Ottoman rule.\n\nTAKING A STAND\n\nAs well as the threat of Attack withdrawing its support, the ruling Socialist party also risks angering voters in the European elections in May. The elections are seen as a key test for the survival of a government that has already faced down three confidence votes since taking power last year.\n\nA Gallup poll last week underlined the country's divided loyalties: 30 percent of Bulgarians supported Ukraine joining the EU, while 27 percent supported Ukraine forging closer links with Russia instead.\n\nThe Socialist party is a direct descendant of the communists who governed Bulgaria before the fall of the Berlin Wall, when the country was seen as Moscow's most pliable ally. Many of its core supporters are pro-Russia.\n\nIts conflicted position has led the government to send mixed signals about its intentions. Bulgaria allowed the first round of sanctions against Russia and twice took part in navy drills with a U.S. warship in the Black Sea. The prime minister said the country would not support further sanctions, but then also suggested Bulgaria would not veto them if imposed.\n\nIn any case, a new round of punitive measures might be fiercely resisted by many of the EU's other ex-communist nations, who are fearful of Russia's aggression but have the most to lose by imposing sanctions.\n\n\"Bulgaria needs to impose a veto,\" said Siderov, a white-haired former journalist, who was charged with hooliganism earlier this month after an alleged row with a female French diplomat on a plane. \"It has the right to do that and then the European Union will not be able to impose sanctions,\" he added.\n\n\"And silently, and not officially, the German and French representatives will say \"well done for saving us\", because their turnover with Russia is in tens of billions of euros.\""}

Where'd you get the money for stickers and gloves?\n\nTommy: Oh, well, so, before I got my bike fixed, I took the money you gave me and I bought some candy bars. Then I sold the candy bars door to door, and made $15! Then I used that $15 and bought more candy bars, and made $25! At the end of two weeks, I had $130! So, then I used $80 to fix my bike and used the rest to buy the stickers and gloves!\n\nGordie: But, I gave you that money to fix your bike.\n\nTommy: I know! Thank you SO much!\n\nGordie: But you had money left over?

{"text": "Women who start new businesses with men have limited opportunities to move into leadership roles, according to sociologists at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; and when they co-found businesses with their husbands, they have even fewer chances to be in charge.\n\nThe study, published in the April issue of the American Sociological Review, comes on the heels of a recent debate about businesses with all-male boards of directors and adds to a growing body of knowledge that documents women's limited access to leadership roles in the business world.\n\n\"This work raises awareness of the conditions that limit women's access and also makes us aware of what might be done to increase the likelihood that women will attain positions of authority,\" said Tiantian Yang, a graduate student in the department of sociology in UNC's College of Arts and Sciences who led the study.\n\nYang and Howard Aldrich, Kenan Professor of Sociology and chair of the sociology department, wanted to explain gender inequality in new businesses because previous research has mostly examined the issue in established organizations. Such firms often have well-established bureaucratic procedures for hiring and promotion, whereas startups must build systems and structures from scratch. Their study is one of the first to explore the emergence of gender roles in new businesses.\n\nThe researchers used a nationally representative sample of 362 mixed-sex startup teams, with 880 entrepreneurs on those teams. Aldrich said it's important to clarify that the sample consists of small, everyday businesses that are still in the startup stages, such as bakeries, gift shops, and building contractors. None of them have reached the growth potential of a Twitter or a Facebook.\n\nSeventy percent of the mixed-sex teams the researchers studied are husband-wife teams.\n\n\"Our explanation for more pronounced gender inequality in spousal teams is that when husband and wife work together, they carry with them the cultural expectations for the male breadwinner and the female homemaker roles into the business setting,\" said Yang. \"And the more children there are at home, the more it amplifies the expectation that the woman will also take on the role of leader of the household.\"\n\nThe researchers found that gender inequality in entrepreneurial teams can be reduced when people adopt organizational templates such as signing a formal operating agreement and developing a business plan in the early stages of the company's founding. These mechanisms help teams evaluate men's and women's competence more equitably and make \"competence\" more salient.\n\nThey found that men are 85 percent more likely than women to be in charge when team members have not signed a formal ownership agreement, but men and women have about the same chance to lead a team when that team has adopted such an agreement.\n\n\"It levels the playing field,\" Aldrich said. \"One of the things we hope this will do is provoke a conversation so that the next time a couple or a mixed-sex team starts talking about forming a business, they can ask, 'Who should be the boss? Who is better at this? Let's talk about the basis by which we'll decide that.'\"\n\nThe research was supported by the Kauffman Foundation of Kansas City, Mo.\n\n###\n\nAbout the American Sociological Association and the American Sociological Review\n\nThe American Sociological Association (www.asanet.org), founded in 1905, is a non-profit membership association dedicated to serving sociologists in their work, advancing sociology as a science and profession, and promoting the contributions to and use of sociology by society.

Tunney spokeswoman Kim Shepherd said the alderman has yet to discuss the issue with the Cubs.\n\nGreen, meanwhile, declined to answer whether the team had made a ticket offer to Emanuel or Tunney.\n\n\"We haven't spent much time thinking about the exceptions,\" Green said. \"We've been too busy celebrating. ... Our focus should be on baseball, and this issue has become a complete distraction during one of the most historic runs in Cubs history.\"\n\nFor more than a decade, the Cubs have offered playoff tickets at face value to federal, state and city officials, even though the mayor and aldermen determine the rules and regulations under which the team can alter their ballpark and do business.\n\nThis year, the ethics board took a new stance under Conlon, who was recently appointed the panel's chairman. But the ethics panel also determined the officials could attend under a \"hosting exception,\" thus the new interpretation of city rules that certain officials could attend if they perform a ceremonial duty.\n\nThe new rules also would apply to regular season games — and offers from other city sports teams — in cases where the market value of the ticket exceeds the face value by more than $50. Public officials are still free to buy tickets on the open market like anyone else.\n\nIf aldermen were to break the rule as newly interpreted and were found in violation, they could face a fine for each infraction ranging from $1,000 to $5,000.\n\nhdardick@chicagotribune.com\n\nTwitter @ReporterHal"}
{"text": "It's official. McDonald's is back. Consumers and investors are ba da ba ba ba lovin' it.\n\nMcDonald's reported fourth-quarter revenues and earnings that easily topped analysts' forecasts, led by a 5.7% jump in same-store sales in the United States.\n\nCEO Steve Easterbrook, who took over at McDonald's nearly a year ago, said the company's introduction of its all day breakfast menu in October was the main reason that U.S. sales did so well.\n\nMany McDonald's fans had been calling on the company for years to make Egg McMuffins, hash browns and other early morning treats available at lunch or dinner time. The menu change clearly has paid off for Mickey D's.\n\nEasterbrook also said that mild weather in the quarter helped.\n\nThis was the second consecutive quarter of domestic same-store sales growth for the fast food giant. But McDonald's isn't just staging an impressive comeback in its home market. Same-store sales rose 5% worldwide.\n\nThe company said there was broad strength across Asia and Europe -- and solid sales gains in emerging markets like Russia and China.\n\nRelated: Burger King, Wendy's and McDonald's in fast food price war\n\nShares of McDonald's (MCD) were up 1% in late morning trading Monday and hit a new all-time high. McDonald's was one of the top stocks in the Dow last year and has held up well so far in what's been a volatile 2016.\n\nMcDonald's has outperformed rivals such as Burger King owner Restaurant Brands (QSR), Wendy's (WEN) and KFC/Taco Bell parent Yum Brands (YUM). It also has done better than some popular fast casual restaurants -- chains like Panera (PNRA) and Chipotle (CMG).\n\nRelated: McDonald's not planning to spin off its real estate assets\n\nEasterbrook deserves credit for owning up to many of the big problems facing the company -- most notably a stale menu that did little to excite the taste buds of its customers.\n\nMany diners were shunning McDonald's in favor of places like Five Guys, Smashburger and Shake Shack (SHAK).\n\nBut since Easterbrook became CEO, McDonald's has added several new burgers -- such as the Pico Guacamole and Buffalo Bacon -- and also gave diners more choices so they could customize the sandwiches.\n\nIt also launched a new Buttermilk Crispy Chicken sandwich.\n\nIt was all part of Easterbrook's strategy to turn McDonald's into a \"modern, progressive burger company\" -- marketing jargon for tastier and fresher food.\n\nRelated: McDonald's selling more gourmet burgers\n\n\"We took bold, urgent action in 2015 to reset the business and position McDonald's to deliver sustained profitable growth,\" said Easterbrook in the company's earnings release Monday.\n\nDuring a conference call with analysts, Easterbrook said that all day breakfast sales exceeded the company's expectations. But he predicted that some of the euphoria will fade following the launch in October.\n\nThat's one reason why the company is experimenting with other new menu items this year as well. It recently introduced mozzarella sticks and is considering launches of mac and cheese and sweet potato fries too.\n\nNeil Saunders, CEO of research firm Conlumino, said in a report Monday that the new offerings -- as well as all day breakfast -- has been \"successful in attracting back lost customers, especially over the important lunchtime period.\"\n\nDuring the conference call, Easterbrook said the restaurant chain is definitely recovering market share it lost over the past few years and gaining customers from its burger rivals and other fast food (or quick service) competitors.\n\nThe company is also trying to hang on to consumers don't want to spend that much when they go to McDonald's.\n\nEasterbrook said about a quarter of its customers are very value conscious. And that's a big reason why McDonald's has recently introduced a McPick $2 menu -- 2 items for 2 dollars.\n\nHe also said the company will continue to invest more on better food quality and service to keep its momentum going."}

REUTERS/Baz Ratner/File Photo\n\nMichael Ron David Kadar, 18, who has dual citizenship and lives in Israel, made at least 245 threatening telephone calls between Jan. 4 and March 7, many targeting Jewish community centers in the United States, according to the Florida complaint.\n\nKadar also appears linked to more than 240 hoax threats called into schools in the United States and Canada between August and December 2015, forcing thousands of students to be evacuated, according to the Georgia complaint.\n\nKadar, who is Jewish, has been in custody in Israel since his arrest there on March 23. His name had been withheld by Israeli authorities pending a formal indictment, which is expected within days.\n\nU.S. and Israeli authorities have not offered a possible motive. Kadar's defense lawyer in Israel has told reporters he has a high IQ but the emotional intelligence of a 5-year-old.\n\nKadar's American-born mother said in an interview with Israel's Channel 2 that her son was home-schooled after he was unable to function in school due to a brain tumor.\n\n\"He's autistic,\" she said. \"He can't control it. He can't think straight.\"\n\nIn the same interview, Kadar's father, who is Israeli, said, \"To all the Jews in America, I want to say clearly, we are very, very sorry, from the bottom of our hearts.\" Both parents were filmed in silhouette to protect their identities.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department did not say whether it would seek his extradition.\n\nThe waves of threats against Jewish groups forced widespread evacuations and prompted concern among Jewish leaders about a resurgence of anti-Semitism. Many Jewish community centers took steps to heighten security in response.\n\nAuthorities have said the calls also went to institutions in Australia, New Zealand and Canada.\n\nTHREATS AGAINST ORLANDO FLIGHT, SCHOOLS, HOME\n\nThe complaints against Kadar provided new detail about the evidence authorities have, including a flash drive found in his laptop containing recordings of numerous telephoned threats.\n\nKadar spontaneously told officers who arrested him at his house in Ashkelon, Israel, that he \"did not do it,\" according to the Florida complaint. When asked what he meant, he referred to the Jewish community center threats, even though no officer had mentioned them, the complaint said.\n\nKadar also has a speech impediment that matched one observed in recordings of the calls, U.S. authorities said. He allegedly used masking technology to hide his location and disguise his voice.\n\nIt was not immediately clear why charges were brought only in Florida and Georgia, after Jewish centers in dozens of states were hit by Kadar's alleged threats.\n\nThe Florida complaint formally charges him with 15 threats, including against a United Airlines flight at Orlando's airport and several Jewish schools. In Georgia, he faces a single count for threatening a private residence in Athens, Georgia, in January, in part because he was not yet 18 when he made the 2015 school threats in that state and therefore cannot face charges as an adult.\n\nIn a statement, the JCC Association of North America praised the \"leadership and determination\" of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and federal investigators.\n\nU.S. authorities previously made one other arrest in connection with the threats. Juan Thompson, a disgraced journalist, is accused of making several threats to Jewish organizations while posing as an ex-girlfriend as part of a revenge plot against her.\n\nHe has denied the charges."}

{"text": "In an interview with Rachel Maddow on Tuesday, Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) announced plans for nationwide protest rallies against the Republican's latest anti-healthcare agenda. The protest events, scheduled to take place just days before Trump takes office, will focus on the on-going effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act and the recent attempts by the GOP to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.\n\n\"On January 15, for the first time in the modern history of the Democratic Party, Democrats are going to be organizing rallies all across this country in opposition to the Republican budget, which calls for throwing 30 million people off of health care, taking their insurance away, privatizing Medicare, making massive cuts in Medicaid, and at the same time giving tax breaks to the wealthy.\"\n\nIn typical Sanders fashion, the Vermont senator is encouraging local activism for the \"Our First Stand: Save Health Care\" protest rallies, calling on elected leaders to mobilize their constituents at home as opposed to gathering at the nation's capital.\n\n\"We're asking U.S. senators, members of the House, labor unions, environmental groups, senior groups, ordinary people to come together and tell the Republican Party that their priorities are absolutely backwards.\"\n\nSanders, a longtime advocate of single-payer healthcare, has been recently reminding the American people of Trump's campaign promises not to cut Medicare, Medicaid, or Social Security. According to the Inquisitr, Sanders has drawn attention to the issue using a variety of methods, including petitions, interviews, letters, and even a giant printout of a Trump tweet.\n\nMr. Trump must make it clear that he will keep his word and veto any legislation that cuts Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. pic.twitter.com/CsqkHCBaNc — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) January 5, 2017\n\nBy calling on the president-elect to keep his promises, Sanders has found common ground with Trump supporters on this topic, as Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security are issues that a majority of both Democratic and Republican voters agree on. According to polling by NASI, an overwhelming number of Americans support the safety net programs, and are even willing to contribute more to preserve and improve benefits.\n\nMr. Trump: You told the American people that you would NOT cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid. Keep your promises. pic.twitter.com/cDtICdLUjG — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) December 30, 2016\n\nAlong with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Sanders warned in a letter last month that Republicans would attempt to gut the Affordable Care Act and privatize Medicare using a fast-track budget tool. This dismantling of the healthcare system goes against the campaign promises made by President-elect Donald Trump, who vowed to the American people that he would not touch the popular safety net programs.\n\n\"Millions of Americans voted for Donald Trump after he promised not to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. He must be held to his promises and should veto any legislation which cuts these vital and necessary health programs.\"\n\nTim Fernholz at Quartz weighed in on the matter, noting that the Independent senator was at the helm of the first Democratic uprising against the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\"Democrats are planning their first major gesture of opposition to Donald Trump's presidency, and Bernie Sanders is leading the charge.\"\n\nAccording to a spokesperson, left-over donations from Sanders' presidential campaign will be used to organize the protest rallies. As the Daily Beast pointed out, this is in stark contrast to the way that the Clinton campaign spent their remaining campaign funds – by splurging on a fancy party for millionaire donors.\n\nOn January 9, Sanders is scheduled to participate in a CNN town hall, where he will discuss the upcoming protest events as well as the broader Democratic strategy going forward. Sanders was recently elected as the Outreach Chair for Senate Democrats.\n\nTo find or organize your local January 15 \"Our First Stand: Save Health Care\" protest rally, sign up here, visit the Our Revolution event page, join your local Bernie Facebook page or subscribe to the Political Revolution subreddit.\n\n[Featured Image by Win McNamee/Getty Images]"}

{"text": "The first \"gerrymander\" was drawn on a map and signed into law on February 11, 1812. Elbridge Gerry, then governor of Massachusetts, signed into law a redistricting plan designed to keep his political party in power in the upcoming election. Upset that the Federalist Party was critical of James Madison's foreign policy, Gerry signed the reapportioning plan that heavily favored his Republican party. Gerry, a man who staunchly followed his principles even against the popular actions of his colleagues, was hesitant to sign the law. The Republican legislators sponsoring and forcing through the bill redrew \"voting lines so that the Federalist vote was concentrated in a few districts, while the Republican vote was spread over many. \" The redistricting authorized by Gerry won 29 seats for the his Republican party, whereas the Federalists won a puny 11 seats.* Gerry's district of Essex was a particularly odd shape, long on one side and curved along the north end.\n\nWhen the law passed, reportedly the editor of the Boston Gazette posted the map with the newly drawn districts on his office wall, and in talking to a fellow editor, compared the shape of Gerry's district to a salamander . The editor said, \"Salamander! Call it a Gerrymander\" — the portmanteau of Gerry + salamander. Gerry's name, incidentally, is pronounced with a hard \"g\" as in \"gary,\" but over time the word \"gerrymander\" came to be pronounced with the soft \"g\" as in \"jerry,\" the pronunciation we use today. In any case, the picture of the cartoon gerrymander map was published in the Boston Gazette on March 26, 1812, with the caption: \"The horrid Monster of which this drawing is a correct representation, appeared in the County of Essex, during the last session of the Legislature.\" The word has since entered into national and international political language.\n\nGerrymandering is a current political topic today; as always, it is usually initiated by the incumbents to retain or increase their power. When gerrymandering is taught in U.S. history classes, it is likely students will be shown a picture of the original political cartoon drawn by Elkanah Tisdale for the Gazette and held here at the Library of Congress. Gerry did not win the 1812 election for his home district despite the reapportionment. He did, however, go on to become James Madison's second vice president later in 1812. He was a signer of the Declaration of Independence, a member of the House of Representatives, twice governor of Massachusetts, and (full disclosure) he proposed the founding of the Library of Congress; he'd probably be dismayed to find this idea is how his name is remembered. Nevertheless, Gerry is forever tied to an important concept in American legal history.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about modern gerrymandering and the law, here is a shortlist of some of our recent holdings, and a map of Essex County:\n\nKF4905.B85 2010 Bullock, Charles S., 1942- Redistricting: the most political activity in America.\n\nKF4930.H37 2014 Hasen, Richard L.

{"text": "Japan on Tuesday ended a two-year nuclear shutdown in the energy-hungry country, sparked by public fears following the 2011 Fukushima crisis, the worst atomic disaster in a generation.\n\nUtility Kyushu Electric Power turned on a reactor at Sendai, about 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) southwest of Tokyo, at 10:30 am (0130 GMT).\n\nThe 31-year-old reactor -- operating under tougher post-Fukushima safety rules -- was expected to reach full capacity around 11:00 pm Tuesday and would start generating power by Friday.\n\nCommercial operations are to begin early next month, a company spokesman said.\n\nThe restart comes more than four years after a quake-sparked tsunami triggered meltdowns at the Fukushima plant, prompting the shutdown of Japan's stable of reactors and setting off a pitched battle over the future use of atomic power.\n\nThe accident sent radiation over a wide area and forced tens of thousands of people from their homes -- many of whom will likely never return.\n\nDecommissioning of the crippled Fukushima reactors is expected to take decades with compensation expenses -- excluding the cost of the site's clean up -- now topping $57 billion.\n\nAnti-nuclear sentiment still runs high in Japan and television showed protesters scuffling with police in front of the Sendai plant, which is on the southernmost main island of Kyushu.\n\nLocal media said about 200 protesters gathered at the site, including former prime minister Naoto Kan who has become a high-profile anti-nuclear activist.\n\nThe resource-poor nation, which once relied on nuclear power for a quarter of its electricity, restarted two reactors temporarily to feed its needs after Fukushima. But they both went offline by September 2013, making Japan completely nuclear-free for about two years.\n\nThe country has ushered in stricter safety regulations to avoid a repeat of the accident, including more backup prevention measures and higher tsunami-blocking walls in some areas.\n\n\"It is important to restart reactors one by one from the perspective of energy security, the economy and measures against global warming, but safety always comes first,\" Industry Minister Yoichi Miyazawa told reporters.\n\nIf another atomic accident happened, he added, the government would \"deal with it responsibly\".\n\nBeefed-up safety measures are key to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's bid to get some of about four dozen reactors back up and running, as Tokyo's energy policy sets its sights on nuclear accounting for as much as 22 percent of Japan's energy needs by 2030.\n\nPower companies that own them are also keen for more restarts, fed up with having to make up lost generating capacity with pricey fossil fuels.\n\nJapan's post-Fukushima energy bill skyrocketed as it scrambled to fill the gap left by taking reactors offline, pushing the country into successive trade deficits.\n\nThose expenses were exacerbated by a sharp weakening of the yen, which pushed up costs for energy imports paid for in other currencies, particularly the US dollar.\n\nSeveral other reactors have received a safety green light from officials, but battle lines have been drawn with many local communities strongly opposed to restarts.\n\nTakashi Kato, professor emeritus at Tokyo's Seikei University, was critical of Tuesday's restart, saying Abe's close business ties were trumping safety concerns.\n\n\"Abe is not listening to the voice of the people -- he is acting as if he has been given a blank cheque,\" Kato said.\n\n\"It is big business demanding a stable supply of power by resuming nuclear reactors, not the general public.\"\n\nSafety officials have stressed that any switched-on reactor would operate under much tighter regulations than those that existed before Fukushima, the worst atomic disaster since Chernobyl in 1986.\n\n\"A disaster like that at Tokyo Electric Power's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant will not occur,\" under the new rules, Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) chairman Shunichi Tanaka said in an interview with the Nikkei newspaper published at the weekend.\n\nBut Tanaka conceded there was \"no such thing as absolute safety\", and Japan's people are sceptical as the country remains deeply scarred by the legacy of Fukushima.\n\nShort link:"}

Perhaps, a more accurate way to express it is that Terran is trying to break the current metagame.\n\nLet's trace back to the last major patch in November 2013.\n\nWidow Mine got nerfed. The 4M style has suffered due to the less ineffective area effect cover against the swarm of Zerg units. When Terran realise that Tanks still don't cut it, the metagame maintained the same for a period of time right after the patch. Thus, Terran got nerfed in TvZ. The main reason for Terran to stick to the 4M style is simply because it was (and probably still is) the best play style in TvZ. You may have watched Day9's analysis of TaeJa's TvZ style after the patch, whereby TaeJa made tactical changes to adapt accordingly. Nevertheless, the core of the style is intact.\n\nCredits to TaeJa, he might be the only Terran who still enjoys that degree of success in the match up after the patch. Even the TvZ god, INnoVation, was suffering. INnoVation decided to discard Widow Mine altogether and tech straight to Thor. But it didn't work out as he was crushed by Life in Dailymotion cup.\n\nSince then, Widow Mine has been a \"hot and cold\" unit in the match up. Some players (e.g., TaeJa) still use it like before, while others are trying to play bio without Widow Mines. This is evident in Bomber's games. He was using the usual 4M unit composition against Scarlett in IEM Singapore. Bomber then mainly used either pure bio or bio Tank in the following week against Soulkey in the Hot6ix cup. That was the state of the match up at the end of 2013: Terran had yet to found a main stream style against Zerg since the patch. Thanks to the concern surrounding the TvP match up, the TvZ match up had not received much attention.\n\nFast forward to the recent Proleague games. Flash was producing Hellbats instead of Widow Mines against Rogue. It might be due to the Roach heavy composition that Rogue was using. However, as the game stabilizes to later stage, Flash still did not opt to produce Widow Mine.\n\nWhat about mech? More and more Terran are using mech in TvZ after the patch. This trend was obvious in IEM Singapore. Mvp vs. Curious and Happy vs. DRG were just some of the examples in the tournament. But the mixed results of mech had yet to convince me that mech is the answer to the match up after the 4M nerf. Most recently, Flash used an interesting opening against Solar in Proleague.\n\n10 – Supply Depot\n\n14 – Command Centre\n\n15 – Refinery\n\n16 – Barracks\n\nThe interesting part of the build the order of barracks and refinery after a 14Cc opening. In general, you open with\n\n10 – Supply Depot\n\n14 – Command Centre\n\n16 – Barracks\n\n17 – Refinery\n\nFlash went for a refinery before barracks. This allows him to build the factory and reactor at around the same time. In short, you skip Marines for earlier reactor Hellions. Although Flash made a pair of Marines before switching the factory on the reactor due to the Zergling at the ramp, the idea is obvious. He then followed up with cloaked Banshee to transit into a standard mech. This build is likely to get punished hard on a two-players map.\n\nThe merit of this build on a big map is that you can apply Hellions and Banshee pressure earlier. Apart from the face value, the earlier pressure allows you to play slightly more greedy behind it than the \"standard\" mech builds. Flash went for a third command centre and followed with two armory for upgrades. Usually, you will add two factories and an armory after the third command centre.\n\nAll in all, mech is still far from solid in the match up. Despite the frustration of using 4M, I can see players swapping between the two styles until an actual metagame shifting innovation is done.\n\nAdvertisements"}
{"text": "We often get asked what people can do to start capoeira. The answer of course is to get to class as soon as possible! However, often people have a time gap before they can begin training, and it's for those people that I'm writing this post.\n\nAú\n\nFirstly, you're likely to encounter many movements you've never done before. This can feel uncomfortable, but don't worry, it's a normal response! To minimise your discomfort though it's a good idea to at least start to familiarise yourself with some of these movements. The most obvious one is cartwheels (or as we call it \"Aú\", which sounds a little like \"Awoo\"). Unless you're a dancer or gymnast you may never have done these, so put your hands on the ground and try hopping across from one leg to the other. Make sure you try both directions, as it's likely that you'll find one side more difficult. Don't worry about making your aú perfect, your teacher will do help you with that, just get comfortable having some weight on your hands.\n\nAdvanced Aú\n\nIf you are comfortable with aú and/or handstands (\"bananeiras\") then try doing them in a capoeira style - instead of looking at the floor put your head between your arms and try and look at something in front of you. This will be very helpful later on when you can see what your partner is doing.\n\nGinga\n\nThe next movement to familiarise yourself with is the ginga. This may be a controversial pick, but in my opinion being a little familiar with the movement helps to free up your brain when your teacher shows you how to do it \"right\", and that outweighs any bad habits you may pick up by trying it out. Depending on your group and style of capoeira the ginga may be rigidly defined or a completely free way to express yourself (or somewhere in the middle).\n\nGinga means \"sway\", and it's the distinctive, basic side-to-side movement of capoeira. There are a lot of terrible how-to videos out there, so I found this one after a short search and it shows most of the basic features: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbUxXJKitS4\n\nSquats and Lunges\n\nCapoeira works your whole body very well, but it is especially intense on the legs. You can get some advantage by practicing squats and lunges as deeply as you can: squat right down until you're practically sitting on the floor or lunge forwards (or backwards) until your knee touches. Be careful doing this if you have any knee injuries, you may need some help from someone knowledgable to correct your form. Even if you have strong legs from running or other sports you may find that the large range of motion here works parts of your muscles that you aren't used to.\n\nGround Work\n\nPut your hands on the floor and go for a walk like a monkey, or a cat, or a crocodile. Try leaving your feet in one place and walking your hands around you in a circle. See if you can do a bridge. Play! This will get you used to moving on the floor as well as working many useful muscles.\n\nFinally\n\nThe last piece of advice I can give is to get excited about your first class! Have a look at some capoeira videos online. There are thousands and they represent so many different levels of skill and styles of play. You won't be able to do everything you see on these videos straight away, but with enough work and a good teacher you will get further than you can believe right now. Things you can't dream of doing right now will become easy. The only guarantee is that there will always be some amazing movement or skill to learn, something new to train. Capoeira doesn't run out. It's an amazing thing and I can't wait to meet you in the roda some day.\n\nOf course, if you'd like to start training capoeira in Perth we'd love to have you, check our website for our class schedule!"}
{"text": "advertising\n\nSince its unveiling at San Diego Comic-Con's Star Trek 50th Anniversary panel, the latest serialized entry, Star Trek: Discovery created a good deal of controversy and curiosity. Between the upcoming show's name, the positive and negative reactions to the new ship, and the vagaries around plot, characters, and setting, fans aren't quite sure what to make of the latest Trek. What we do know about the new series is its place in the Prime timeline, rather than the Kelvin timeline of the reboots – much to the delight of old school Trekkies.\n\nThe most recent reports about the show point to a female captain, possibly of a non-white ethnicity, as well as an even newer report that suggest the timeline of the new series has been uncovered thanks to some sleuthing encouraged by none other than series executive producer Bryan Fuller.\n\nAin't It Cool News recently discussed the new Trek series with Fuller, and during their luncheon tête-à-tête, the producer dropped some hints as to the Discovery's locale on the Prime timeline. Fuller hinted at clues to the show hidden in the ship registry, saying:\n\n\"There's a big clue in the number of the ship [NCC-1031] that indicates when we're set.\"\n\nAside from the jokes Fuller made about loving Halloween during Comic-Con, Trek fans have already been picking apart the U.S.S. Discovery for clues about the new show. The new ship's call sign is listed as NCC-1031. If there's any logic to the Star Trek canon of ships, 1031 comes well before 1701, the registration of the legendary U.S.S. Enterprise commanded by one James T. Kirk. Assuming Fuller wasn't being contrarian and assuming that the universe follows along the Vulcan-like (and human) lines of logical reasoning, a lower-numbered ship precedes a higher-numbered one. In that case, the new Star Trek series will take place before the original Enterprise's five-year mission began.\n\nadvertising\n\nWhen asked about the rumored connection (once again, due to the call sign) between the Discovery and Starfleet's covert wing Section 31, Fuller remained equally coy, saying:\n\n\"There are aspects of our first season that, depending on how well versed you are in that mythology, you could either read into it a connection or not.\"\n\nWhile Fuller doesn't reveal any officially sanctioned details, his hints could be very telling. As stated earlier, there are no strict rules governing Starfleet registry numbers in the Star Trek universe. Nonetheless, running ship numbers from NX-01 (Enterprise) to NCC-1701 (Star Trek) to NCC-2000 (Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country) to NCC-74656 (Star Trek: Voyager) certainly makes it seem as though the Discovery was built before the first Enterprise. If this is true, it would place the show squarely between the Enterprise series and the 1966 classic that kicked everything off.\n\nadvertising\n\nHowever, a series set between Enterprise and the first series wreaks havoc with the existing canon. Most classic starships had numerous iterations and refits – at least some record of their construction and service exists within the storied history of Starfleet. Without any prior knowledge of the Discovery's call sign or model and make of ship (although there are other mentions of ships named Discovery in-canon), Fuller's enigmatic response to Section 31 could clue viewers in as to the reason the design of the ship – and its asteroid shipyard home – aren't included in Federation annals.\n\nFortunately, Fuller will supposedly \"spoiler it up\" about Star Trek: Discovery during the Star Trek's Television Critics Association panel on August 10. Hopefully, he'll bring with him further clarification as to the ship, its crew, and its non-cryptic designation within the Prime timeline.\n\nThe new Star Trek series will debut on CBS All Access and Netflix in January 2017.\n\nSource: AICN\n\nadvertising\n\nGive Screen Rant a Thumbs up!\n\nDefenders Season 2 Isn't 'Off the Table', Says Marvel TV Head\n\n992 Shares Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied\n\nadvertising"}

However, the judge also said he would cancel the session if he's \"satisifed\" with the government's actions to limit or revoke 2,000 three-year work permits it issued to illegal immigrants after Hanen issued an injunction that limited new permits to a two-year duration.\n\n\"This Court has expressed its willingness to believe that these actions were accidental and not done purposefully to violate this Court's order. Nevertheless, it is shocked and surprised at the cavalier attitude the Government has taken with regard to its 'efforts' to rectify this situation,\" Hanen wrote.\n\n\"The Government has conceded that it has directly violated this Court's Order in [the government's] May 7, 2015 advisory, yet, as of today, two months have passed since the Advisory and it has not remediated its own violative behavior. That is unacceptable and, as far as the Government's attorneys are concerned, completely unprofessional,\" the judge added in his order (posted here). \"Neither side should interpret this Court's personal preference to not sanction lawyers or parties as an indication that it will merely acquiesce to a party's unlawful conduct.\"\n\nSpokespeople for the Homeland Security Department and the White House had no comment Tuesday on the order, which applies to Johnson as well as Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Leon Rodriguez., Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Sarah Saldana, Border Patrol Deputy Chief Ronald Vitiello and Customs and Border Patrol Director Gil Kerlikowske.\n\nHomeland Security spokeswoman Marsha Catron confirmed Wednesday that the agency is aware of Hanen's order. \"DHS has received the District Court order and is currently reviewing it with the Department of Justice,\" she said. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.\n\nThe Obama administration has run into a series of problems in the immigration lawsuit beyond the policy and political headaches caused by Hanen's February injunction. Hanen's move halted Obama's moves to expand a program to grant quasi-legal status and work permits to more illegal immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children and to create a similar new program for illegal immigrants who are parents of U.S. citizens or green card holders.\n\nHanen and the 26 states suing to block Obama's actions have accused the administration of misleading the court about the fact that about 100,000 immigrants were given three-year work permits under the actions Obama announced in November. The judge said he was under the impression none of Obama's changes to the deferred action program had been implemented when legal arguments played out on the issue earlier this year. Justice Department lawyers have said there was no intent to mislead but that they regret any confusion.\n\nThere was some mention in court filings of the issuance of three-year permits in court papers, but the judge said oral comments by the government's lawyers led him to believe the change to three-year permits had not taken place.\n\nAfter clarifying that point in March, the Justice Department came forward in May to disclose the 2,000 issuances after Hanen's order. Government lawyers said DHS's inspector general is investigating why the three-year permits were issued despite the court injunction.\n\nA federal appeals court panel is scheduled to hear arguments Friday on whether Hanen's injunction should be overturned.\n\nHanen is an appointee of President George W. Bush.\n\n(hat tip: Josh Blackman, representing an amicus in the case)\n\nUPDATE (Wednesday, 10:46 A.M.): This post has been updated with Catron's comment."}
{"text": "By Robert Mullin\n\nCAISO last week provided an explanation of its decision to increase regulation requirements in response to the growing variability on its system.\n\nThe ISO's Department of Market Monitoring last month called attention to the sharp rise in costs from the requirements, prompting the California Energy Commission to ask the ISO to justify the move. (See CAISO Regulation Costs Quadruple as Price, Procurement Jump.)\n\nDuring a Market Performance and Planning Forum last week, CAISO said it doubled its frequency regulation service requirement from late February to mid-June in response to recurring short-term generation forecasting errors stemming from variable wind and solar resources during late winter and spring.\n\nThe forecasting problem is mostly isolated to spring, when high renewable output often coincides with periods of low loads in California. At the same time, weather patterns tend to be more erratic, often making it especially difficult to predict renewable output on a moment-to-moment basis.\n\nRegulation prices more than doubled shortly after the ISO increased its daily regulation procurement from 400 MW or less to as much as 800 MW in late February. Daily payments to regulation service providers surged from $100,000 to more than $400,000, the ISO's Monitor found last month.\n\nThe ISO rolled back regulation requirements to previous levels for summer because of more predictable weather patterns.\n\nFurther compounding the spring forecasting issue is the increasing adoption of residential rooftop solar, which is subject to the same variability as utility-scale projects. The ISO estimates it has nearly 5,000 MW in rooftop solar in its balancing area, with new installations added daily. Variability in behind-the-meter rooftop output complicates matters by causing loads to skew from forecasts depending on whether the sun is shining.\n\nThe problem \"happens more in the off-season — with more of the clouds coming in,\" said Amber Motley, CAISO short-term forecasting manager. \"Timing and forecasting of [generation] ramps are very difficult. Forecasting cloud coverage is difficult.\"\n\nVariable wind production can also be a factor, with cold fronts making it difficult to predict the timing of wind ramps and changes in wind direction causing intermittency.\n\nClyde Loutan, ISO senior advisor for renewable energy integration, said weather changes can occur too quickly to incorporate revised forecasts into the real-time market run. He also pointed out that forecasting errors are not covered under the ISO's real-time contingency dispatch process, which sets aside generation to allow the system to recover from major disturbances.\n\n\"So you have to rely on regulation,\" Loutan said.\n\n\"Seems like it's more a failure of the forecast,\" said Dan Williams, CAISO markets analyst at Portland General Electric. \"And that should be changed by changing the market rather than rolling it into regulation.\"\n\nLoutan countered that he didn't know of any forecaster that could reflect the intermittency in the five-minute market.\n\n\"When you think about how these markets were designed, they were really designed for conventional units,\" he said.\n\nLoutan also pointed to a clear financial incentive driving the ISO's increased requirement.\n\n\"Back in January we had some pretty bad days when we didn't control the frequency well enough,\" he said. \"For 11 hours, we had a hard time controlling the system. We found out that we were running out of regulation.\"\n\nIf the condition had persisted longer than 30 consecutive minutes, the ISO would have been subject to as much as $1 million in NERC penalties, he said.\n\nCarolyn Kehrein, principal consultant for the Energy Users Forum, suggested that increased regulation costs should be allocated to intermittent resources if the forecasting problem continued and the ISO didn't develop new tools to deal with it. She said increased costs for intermittency should encourage the \"right kind\" of renewable development, such as geothermal.\n\nWei Zhou, senior project manager with Southern California Edison, agreed with applying the cost-causation principle to the problem.\n\n\"This is something that we're looking at long-term,\" said Loutan, referring to the forecasting issue at large. \"But for now we just wanted to explain why we increased our regulation procurement.\""}

The end was immediate, apart from a handful of fanatical holdouts, resistance in the city had crumbled. The 28th Army of the 1st Ukrainian Front and the 2nd Army of the 1st Belorussian Front came together on the Charlottenburg Chaussee, the main civic artery from central Berlin to the west at the Charlottenburg Palace.\n\nBerlin 1945.\n\nGerman forces seeking to escape had attempted a breakout the night before. The remaining Wehrmacht forces, low on ammunition, food and morale desperately attempted to flee, while berlin was now nothing but rubble and ruins and with Soviet armour and infantry pouring into the cracks of the failing German units, it was this night in a last ditch effort to escape, a small group of infantry supported by a lone panther tank made a break out to the west using the bombed out and wrecked features of the gardens, this small group would be the last of berlins forces to escape encirclement. Only those who passed through the Tiergarten had success evading capture or death amongst the Soviet lines, several other attempts were made that night but all but the attempt at the tiergarten failed horribly. Though a few of those successfully escaped to the Western front only to fall into the hands of the western allies.\n\nAt dawn, forces of the Soviet Union captured the Reich Chancellery, Clearing it room by room, it was a bloody battle to the last. When victorious they hoisted the Flag of the Soviet union above the ruins.

{"text": "By Jonathan Landay and David Rohde\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - In his first call as president with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump denounced a treaty that caps U.S. and Russian deployment of nuclear warheads as a bad deal for the United States, according to two U.S. officials and one former U.S. official with knowledge of the call.\n\nWhen Putin raised the possibility of extending the 2010 treaty, known as New START, Trump paused to ask his aides in an aside what the treaty was, these sources said.\n\nTrump then told Putin the treaty was one of several bad deals negotiated by the Obama administration, saying that New START favored Russia. Trump also talked about his own popularity, the sources said. The White House declined to comment. It referred Reuters to the official White House account issued after the Jan. 28 call, which did not mention the discussion about New START.\n\nIt has not been previously reported that Trump had conveyed his doubt about New START to Putin in the hour-long call.\n\nNew START gives both countries until February 2018 to reduce their deployed strategic nuclear warheads to no more than 1,550, the lowest level in decades. It also limits deployed land- and submarine-based missiles and nuclear-capable bombers.\n\nDuring a debate in the 2016 presidential election, Trump said Russia had \"outsmarted\" the United States with the treaty, which he called \"START-Up.\" He asserted incorrectly then that it had allowed Russia to continue to produce nuclear warheads while the United States could not.\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson said he supported the treaty during his Senate confirmation hearings. During the hearings Tillerson said it was important for the United States to \"stay engaged with Russia, hold them accountable to commitments made under the New START and also ensure our accountability as well.\"\n\nRelated Video:\n\nFor more news videos visit Yahoo View, available now on iOS and Android.\n\nTwo of the people who described the conversation were briefed by current administration officials who read detailed notes taken during the call. One of the two was shown portions of the notes. A third source was also briefed on the call.\n\nReuters has not reviewed the notes taken of the call, which are classified.\n\nThe Kremlin did not immediately respond to requests for comment. CONCERNS OVER PHONE CALLS\n\nThe phone call with Putin has added to concerns that Trump is not adequately prepared for discussions with foreign leaders.\n\nTypically, before a telephone call with a foreign leader, a president receives a written in-depth briefing paper drafted by National Security Council staff after consultations with the relevant agencies, including the State Department, Pentagon and intelligence agencies, two former senior officials said.\n\nJust before the call, the president also usually receives an oral \"pre-briefing\" from his national security adviser and top subject-matter aide, they said.\n\nTrump did not receive a briefing from Russia experts with the NSC and intelligence agencies before the Putin call, two of the sources said. Reuters was unable to determine if Trump received a briefing from his national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nIn the phone call, the Russian leader raised the possibility of reviving talks on a range of disputes and suggested extending New START, the sources said.\n\nNew START can be extended for another five years, beyond 2021, by mutual agreement. Unless they agree to do that or negotiate new cuts, the world's two biggest nuclear powers would be freed from the treaty's limits, potentially setting the stage for a new arms race.\n\nNew START was ratified by the U.S. Senate in December 2010 by a vote of 71 to 26. Thirteen Republican senators joined all of the Senate's Democrats in voting for the treaty, although Republican opponents derided it as naive.\n\nThe call with Putin was one of several with foreign leaders where Trump has turned to denounce deals negotiated by previous administrations on trade, acceptance of refugees and arms control.\n\nIn a phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Trump questioned an agreement reached by the Obama administration to accept 1,250 refugees now being held by Australia in offshore detention centers.

{"text": "United States Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump sparked fresh controversy late on Friday after he appeared to refer to the potential assassination of his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton for the second time.\n\n\"I think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons. Disarm immediately,\" Trump told a rally in Miami. \"Take their guns away ... let's see what happens to her.\"\n\n\"Take their guns away, OK? It'll be very dangerous,\" he continued.\n\nClinton's campaign manager Robby Mook slammed the comments, saying they ought to be \"out of bounds for a presidential candidate\".\n\n\"Whether this is done to provoke protesters at a rally, or casually or even as a joke, it is an unacceptable quality in anyone seeking the job of commander in chief,\" said Mook in a statement quoted by CNN.\n\nThe comments came a month after Trump was accused of encouraging gun owners to assassinate Clinton if she wins the November 8 presidential election.\n\n\"Hillary wants to ... essentially abolish the Second Amendment,\" Trump said at a rally in North Carolina in early August, referring to the US Constitution's enshrinement of the right to bear arms.\n\n\"By the way, and if she gets ... to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is. I don't know,\" he continued.\n\nTrump at the time denied the comments were an incitement to violence, saying he was encouraging guns rights activists to take to the ballot box and vote for him.\n\n'Birther' Movement\n\nFriday's comments came just hours after Trump, who for years had questioned Barack Obama's nationality as part of the Birther Movement, acknowledged for the first time that the president was a native-born US citizen.\n\n\"President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again,\" Trump said in an appearance at his company's newly opened hotel in\n\nWashington.\n\nThe US Constitution requires the president to be a citizen by birth.\n\nObama, the first African-American president, was born in Hawaii to married university students. His mother was a Kansas native, and his father was a foreign student from Kenya.\n\nClinton's campaign blasted his comments as \"disgraceful,\" while Obama himself laughed off the issue, telling reporters he had \"no reaction\" to Trump's apparent reversal.\n\n\"I'm shocked that a question like that would come up at a time when we've got so many other things to do,\" Obama said before meetings Friday at the White House.\n\n\"Well, I'm not that shocked, actually. It's fairly typical. ... I was pretty confident about where I was born. I think most people were, as well. And my hope would be that the presidential election reflects more serious issues than that.\"\n\nMore reversals\n\nWhile campaigning on Friday in South Florida, which has a large Cuban-American population, Trump also said that if he is elected president, he will reverse Obama's efforts to normalise relations with Cuba — unless the country abides by certain \"demands\".\n\nAmong those, he said, would be religious and political freedom for the Cuban people and the freeing of all political prisoners.\n\nTrump says he will \"stand with the Cuban people in their fight against communist oppression\".\n\nThe comment marks yet another reversal for the Republican candidate, who previously said he supported the idea of normalised relations, but wished the US had negotiated a better deal.\n\nREAD MORE: Here's why Donald Trump might win\n\nTrump also said that the US has a broader obligation to stand with oppressed people - a comment that seems at odds with his \"America first\" mantra.\n\n\"The next president of the United States must stand in solidarity with all people oppressed in our hemisphere, and we will stand with oppressed people, and there are many,\" he said.\n\nHe added that the people of Venezuela \"are yearning to be free, they are yearning for help. The system is bad. But the people are great.\"\n\nTrump has often cited the country as a model of a failed state, warning that if Clinton is elected, she will turn the US into Venezuela."}
{"text": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel | Sean Gallup/Getty Images Angela Merkel: refugee policy misunderstood, not mistaken The AfD is on its way to the Bundestag, while the CDU will lose influence in Germany's upper house.\n\nBERLIN — Angela Merkel responded to her Christian Democrats' (CDU) serious setback in Berlin state elections by acknowledging shortcomings in how she communicated her refugee policy — but not in the policy itself.\n\nIn Sunday's election, both Merkel's CDU and the Social Democrats (SPD), Germany's second-largest party, plummeted, while the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) made huge gains. Founded only three years ago, the AfD now has seats in 10 of the 16 German state assemblies. It took over 14 percent of votes cast in the capital.\n\nThe chancellor stood by her decision a year ago to let hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers, many fleeing the war in Syria, into German — a policy that has put the AfD on course to enter the Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, in next year's national election.\n\n\"If one of the reasons for the bad performance of the CDU is that the direction, aim and the underlying conviction of our refugee policy were not sufficiently explained to some people, I would like to put more effort into this,\" Merkel said in a press conference on Monday.\n\n\"The reasons [for Sunday's election setback] lie in state politics, but not exclusively,\" said the CDU leader. \"I am the head of this party, and I certainly don't evade responsibility.\"\n\nMerkel, whose support is taking a battering ahead of next year's election, has also renounced her year-old mantra \"We can do it\" — her defiant response to those who doubted the country could cope with the influx of refugees, which continued until a few weeks ago.\n\n\"The sentence is part of my political work, it's the expression of its stance and its aim,\" Merkel said. \"Much has been interpreted into this … sentence. So much that I hardly want to repeat it,\" she said, adding that it had been widely misunderstood and turned into an \"empty phrase.\"\n\n\"The discussion around it has become an ever-more-unproductive loop. Some felt provoked by the sentence, and I never intended that,\" she said.\n\nThe CDU has come under constant criticism since the refugee crisis began from its more conservative Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU). Members of Merkel's party blame the CSU for the CDU's election setbacks in Berlin and earlier this month in the northeastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, where Merkel has her constituency.\n\n\"[CSU chief Horst Seehofer] left no stone unturned in trying to run the CDU down,\" said Karl-Georg Wellmann, a CDU lawmaker in the Bundestag, on German radio Monday.\n\nThe CDU looks likely to be excluded from power-sharing in the Berlin state assembly, where the SPD will need two other partners — probably the Greens and far-left Linke — to govern the capital. More seriously, the result will diminish CDU's already limited influence in the Bundesrat, or upper house of the German parliament, where the federal states are represented.\n\nSpeaking about the rise of the AfD, Merkel said on Monday she felt unable to deploy facts against the far-right party's appeal to insecurity and angst.\n\n\"I, myself, would like to respond to it with a feeling I have,\" she said, using uncharacteristically emotional language. \"I have the feeling we will emerge from these complicated times stronger than before… Who, if not us, should be capable of making something good out of this?\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday spoke out against \"uncontrolled migration.\"\n\nSpeaking before the U.N. General Assembly in New York, May said: \"I think that uncontrolled migration is not in the interests of the migrants themselves, it's not in the interests of refugees — who may find that they see less support as a result — it's not in the interests of the countries that people are coming from, traveling through or trying to get to.\""}

New documentary discussing childbirth as the most pressing global Human Rights issue premieres all over the world on Thursday September 20th.\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nFreedom For Birth World Premiere\n\nPRLog (Press Release) – Sep 13, 2012 –\n\nOttawa, Ontario – One needn't talk to many people to hear a childbirth horror story. The question Dr. Nancy Salgueiro asks is \"Women are submitting to or being forced into procedures they do not want or need when giving birth. Why are women laying down and accepting the abuses happening in childbirth?\"\n\nDr. Nancy Salgueiro, a leading expert in childbirth education and women's empowerment revealed, \"There are women and babies being victimized and traumatized by abusive treatment and unnecessary medical interventions in birth.\"\n\nDiscussions with women who have experienced childbirth uncover:\n\n• Women are given misleading information making them feel as if procedures are necessary when they are not.\n\n• Women are being told they are incapable of birthing their own baby and must trust in system that does not support normal birth.\n\n• Women are being forced to birth in institutions because of lack of access to birth attendants outside hospitals.\n\n• Women are abused and assaulted by procedures done to their bodies without consent and even after consent is withdrawn.\n\n• Women are being told they have no choices and must comply with medical orders or be threatened that their child may be taken from them.\n\nThe evidence is clear as to how to have a safe and gentle birth and yet the current birth climate is reflecting interventions not supported by research, record high rates of surgical births, and women experiencing post traumatic stress as a result of what has been termed \"birth rape\".\n\nHuman rights lawyers, film makers, and organizations like the Informed Choice Coalition are looking to change this.\n\nThursday, September 20, 2012 marks the world premier of the Freedom for Birth.\n\nFreedom for Birth is a 60 minute documentary featuring a Who's Who of leading birth experts and international Human Rights lawyers all calling for radical change to the world's maternity systems.\n\nHermine Hayes-Klein, US lawyer and organiser of the recent Human Rights in Childbirth Conference at the Hague, the Netherlands says, \"the way that childbirth is being managed in many countries around the world is deeply problematic. Millions of pregnant women are pushed into hospitals, pushed onto their back and cut open. They are subject to unnecessary pharmaceutical and surgical interventions that their care providers openly admit to imposing on them for reasons of finance and convenience. Women around the world are waking up to the fact that childbirth doesn't have to be like this and it shouldn't. Disrespect and abuse are not the necessary price of safety\".\n\nFreedom For Birth, made by British filmmakers Toni Harman and Alex Wakeford, tells the story of an Hungarian midwife Agnes Gereb. Ms Gereb has been jailed for supporting women who have chosen to give birth at home. Anna Ternovsky, a home birth mother supported by Ms Gereb decided to stand up for her right to choose the best birth for her baby.\n\nWhen pregnant with her second child, Ternovsky took her country of Hungary to the European Court of Human Rights. This landmark trial was a victory for women and has major implications for childbirth around the world.\n\nToni Harman, one of the filmmakers says, \"the Ternovsky vs Hungary ruling at the European Court of Human Rights in 2010 means that now in Europe, every birthing woman has the legal right to decide where and how she gives birth. And across the world, it means that if a woman feels like her Human Rights are being violated because her birth choices are not being fully supported, she could use the power of the law to protect those rights. With the release of \"Freedom For Birth\", we hope millions of women become aware of their legal rights and so our film has the potential to spark a revolution in maternity care across the world. In fact, we are calling this the Mothers' Revolution.\""}
{"text": "by\n\nJoanna Mather\n\nMisa Han Employers will respond to new restrictions on paid parental leave by dumping their own schemes, business leaders warn. From the start of July, next year, parents will no longer be allowed to access government-funded paid parental leave if their employer provides a more generous scheme. At present, new mothers can access 18 weeks' of pay at minimum wage, or about $11,500, as well as payments made by their employer. The government says it wants to end this \"doubling dipping\". The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry warned that employers would respond by getting rid of their own schemes, denying the government the $1 billion in savings it anticipates.\n\nChief Executive Women president Diane Smith-Gander said the \"disappointing\" change would widen the superannuation gap between men and women at a time when Treasurer Joe Hockey insisted people needed to be independent in retirement. Advertisement\n\nThis was because new parents would move off company schemes on to the government one, which does not cover super payments. \"To have [Mr Hockey] characterise the topping up of what he himself identified as an inadequate parental leave scheme as double-dipping is unbelievable,\" she said. Unsustainable \"Men control 64 per cent of super balances and women 36 per cent and women live longer than men so this is an unsustainable situation. I thought the treasurer got that.\"\n\nVodafone has promised to keep its own paid parental leave scheme, which provides 16 weeks at full pay. \"We will provide the paid parental leave regardless of anything the government does,\" the general manger of human resources, Vanessa Hicks, said. \"We provide the payment to take away some of the financial stress and we want to attract talent and retain talent during parental leave.\" ACCI chief executive Kate Carnell said businesses would withdraw their own schemes so employees could access the government one. Those paying more than the government scheme would use whatever extra money would have been spent on parental leave to boost other perks or incentives, she said.\n\n\"They'll say to employees, let's see how we can rejig your package to work best for you,\" she said. \"Maybe you might like a bonus on return to work. Or maybe you would like to work four days and we'll pay you for five.\" Ms Carnell said the government's anticipated $1 billion in savings was premised on the fact businesses would continue provide their own schemes. That premise was false, she said. Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced plans to make paid parental leave more generous in 2010 and the Coalition took the policy to two elections. Criticism\n\nThe original $5.5 billion plan was to pay new mothers their full salary plus superannuation for six months up to a limit of $150,000. That figure that was revised downwards to $100,000 in response to criticism about the cost of the scheme before Mr Abbott dumped it altogether. \"It's not double-dipping, it's double-crossing,\" said Marian Baird, an industrial relations professor at the University of Sydney. \"The government went to the electorate with a generous paid maternity leave scheme. They have now dropped that and furthermore, have taken away what women have. Australia is going backwards.\"\n\nAustralian Council of Trade Unions president Ged Kearney said the basic scheme was intended as just that, a basic scheme that would be added to by employers. \"To say women are 'double dipping' fundamentally misrepresents the paid parental leave scheme which was always intended to complement employer-based entitlements,\" she said. Mr Abbott conceded it was a disappointing development. Wrench \"It was a bit of a wrench for me, as you'd expect, given my long-term commitment to paid parental leave,\" he said on Monday. \"But nevertheless, given the circumstances that we found ourselves in, it was important that we prioritise in this way and, as I said, this is going to be a very good policy, good for families and good for the family.\" The government says about half of mothers have no access to an employer-provided scheme. They will receive 18 weeks at minimum wage, or $11,500. Parents who have access to an employer scheme that is more generous will no longer be eligible for government support."}

{"text": "EPA administrator Gina McCarthy testifies before the House Subcommittee on Energy and Power on Capitol Hill in September 2013.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency on Friday proposed the first-ever limits on greenhouse gas emissions from new power plants. The much-anticipated announcement brings the agency one step closer to fulfilling a key pillar of President Obama's sweeping climate plan — cutting carbon pollution from both new and existing power plants.\n\nSpeaking before reporters at the National Press Club, EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy touted the agency's plan as \"one of the most significant actions we can take\" to protect public health and the environment from the dangers of climate change. \"By taking commonsense action to limit carbon pollution from new power plants we can slow the effects of climate change and fulfill our obligation to ensure a safe and healthy environment for our children,\" McCarthy said.\n\nNoting the \"really long lifetimes\" of power plants, McCarthy explained that \"people are making decisions about these plants today, and that is why we need to act today.\" The standards, the administrator added, would \"ensure a clear path forward for a full energy mix.\"\n\nUnder the proposal, the EPA would require one standard for large natural gas plants, allowing an emissions rate of 1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour of power generated. Another, slightly less restrictive standard would apply to coal-fired facilities, allowing a carbon dioxide emissions rate of 1,100 lbs. per megawatt hour.\n\nEPA air officials say a modern gas plant could meet the standard but not its coal counterpart. Under the plan, the agency would require future coal plants to install equipment for capturing and storing carbon pollution on a partial scale, which officials call \"a simpler, less costly way to reduce carbon emissions.\"\n\nAgency officials present their proposal as \"both flexible and achievable.\" They point to the construction of four coal plants that will feature carbon capture and storage technology as proof that this equipment is available and ready for use. As with most technologies, they say, the cost will likely become more affordable over time.\n\nThe proposed rule essentially mirrors emissions standards that the EPA put forth in March 2012, setting off a fierce lobbying frenzy among coal companies and coal-burning utilities opposed to what they consider to be an effective ban on coal plants. Opponents say this latest proposal would have pretty much the same effect.\n\n\"We don't believe there will be any new coal plants because of this rule,\" Paul Bailey, of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, the coal industry's most public voice, said Friday. \"We think this rule is really bad for coal plants and it's really bad for carbon capture and storage, too.\"\n\n-------------------------\n\nDon't miss a single Center for Public Integrity investigation on the environment.\n\nSign up now to receive special newsletters relevant to your interest.\n\n-------------------------\n\nSuch technology, coal advocates say, has yet to be commercially proven. They note that none of the four coal plants EPA officials cite are operating — two are under construction and two are under development. For the most part, they argue, these are government-funded demonstration projects whose conditions cannot be replicated at coal plants across the country.\n\n\"Until a few months ago, no one would have believed that the EPA would have claimed that carbon capture was demonstrated technology,\" said Jeffrey Holmstead, who represents coal and utility companies at the D.C. lobbying firm Bracewell & Guiliani.\n\nCalling the new EPA plan \"surprisingly aggressive,\" he noted that the agency's 2012 proposal declined to make such a claim. He predicted the coal and utility industries will fight the agency's reliance on nascent technology as a basis for an emissions standard.\n\n\"There will certainly be a big debate over this,\" added Holmstead, who headed the EPA's air office under President George W. Bush. \"If EPA says, 'This is the standard,' there will be litigation.\"\n\nIn a statement, Trip Van Noppen, president of the environmental law firm Earthjustice, called the EPA proposal \"welcome news. Tackling carbon pollution from power plants is critical to addressing the climate crisis that we now face.\"\n\nThe EPA proposal must go through a 60-day public comment period, and the agency plans to hold a public hearing."}

{"text": "When Florence Metz turned in her Ph.D. thesis on water protection policy this year at the University of Bern in Switzerland, she thought her work was done. But then a friend sent her an email with congratulations and an order: \"Dance your Ph.D.!\"\n\nThe friend was referring to Science's annual contest, which challenges scientists to explain their research through interpretive dance. But Metz only had 3 weeks to go before the deadline. \"Everything had to go fast,\" she says, so she recruited a small army of friends to help her create a dance video that combines hip hop, salsa, and even acro-yoga. Each dance style represented a different interest group that shapes the evolution of policies around water resources.\n\nHer quick thinking paid off: Metz has bested 31 other teams to become this year's Dance Your Ph.D. winner. The judges gave her top marks not only for the work's scientific and artistic merit but how she creatively combined both. She takes home $1000 and a trip to Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, in the spring—thanks to HighWire Press, Science's online publishing platform—where she'll screen her dance video and give a talk. It is the first time a social scientist has scooped the top prize in the contest's 8-year history.\n\nThis year's crop of dances was unusually strong in traditional choreographic technique. Besides the overall prize, there are $500 prizes for four categories: biology, chemistry, physics, and social science, the last of which Metz won. Like Metz, the winners of the other three prizes all have dance training of one kind or another and used it. For biology, Pearl Lee brought her ballet skills to bear on her Ph.D. research on tropoelastin—the precursor protein that builds connective tissue—at the University of Sydney in Australia. For the winner of the physics prize, Merritt Moore, a Ph.D. student at the University of Oxford, in the United Kingdom, it was tango, which she used to explain her research on entangled photons. (Get it?)\n\nPerhaps the most elaborate of the dances, certainly in terms of costumes, came from the chemistry winner Jyaysi Desai, a Ph.D. student at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in Germany. She used dance elements from Bollywood to capture her research on the molecular nets of DNA and protein that white blood cells cast into infection sites to trap bacteria. She won the Audience Favorite award by a landslide.\n\n\"My main aim with this video was to make people laugh,\" Metz says. But she's now finding that the dance helps people understand her work better. \"This bridge between academia and the nonacademic world is crucial.\"\n\nThis year's winners:\n\nSOCIAL SCIENCE and overall winner:\n\nFlorence Metz\n\n\"Do policy networks matter to explain policy design?\" (see video, above)\n\nPh.D. student, University of Bern, Switzerland\n\nPHYSICS winner:\n\nMerritt Moore\n\n\"Exploring multi-photon states for quantum information applications\"\n\nPh.D. student, University of Oxford, United Kingdom\n\nBIOLOGY winner:\n\nPearl Lee\n\n\"Cellular interactions with tropoelastin\"\n\nPh.D. student, University of Sydney, Australia\n\nCHEMISTRY winner and AUDIENCE FAVORITE:\n\nJyaysi Desai\n\n\"Molecular mechanisms involved in neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation\"\n\nPh.D. student, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Germany\n\nThis year's judges:\n\nAllan Adams , Massachussets Institute of Technology (MIT)\n\nRebecca Saxe , MIT\n\nSuzanne Walsh , Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\n\nDimitar Sasselov , Harvard University\n\nMatt Kent , associate artistic director, Pilobolus\n\nEmily Kent , education coordinator, Pilobolus\n\nRenee Jaworski , associate artistic director, Pilobolus\n\nAnd the winners of the previous 7 years of the Dance Your Ph.D. contest."}

The lesson covers all aspects both internally and externally on the Alternator. You'll have a complete understanding on how they work. You can test yourself with the included Quiz and, the documentation covers 3D printing and assembling your very own Alternator Model. Featured Designs of the week - Pinshape - December 1, 2017\n\nFeatured on Thingiverse - December 3, 2017\n\nArticle featuring the Alternator Project on 3DPrint.com - December 8, 2017 (https://3dprint.com/196533/chris-halliday-automotive-parts/)\n\nHow I Designed This\n\nThe complete Brake Caliper project was designed in Autodesk Fusion 360 Tolerances are important when 3D Printing. The tough part is ensuring your print will work with everyone's desktop 3D printer. This can be quite a challenge. With the Educational Alternator, the fit of most pieces of the caliper were set with ~.5-.7mm tolerances in SLS Technology. My initial planning of the Alternator was to have the ability to pull the alternator part, pull the pieces off and re-assemble so you can see the inner workings and all of the components of an Alternator.\n\nStandards\n\nOverview and Background\n\nAre you curious how an automotive alternator works? Do you know that most vehicles on the road today have an alternator that is used to charge your vehicle's battery allowing you to run your headlights, stereo and even to charge your cell phone. Alternators play a crucial role in your vehicle and I have set out and put together this comprehensive lesson to help educate our youth and anyone else curious about vehicles.\n\nWhile it is great to read and learn about alternators, there is really no substitution for holding a physical part in hand and having something to look at up close. Along with the extensive lesson included, I've gone into great detail about the 3D printing aspect of the Alternator and walk you through the process of making your own alternator. This will make it a great project for your class to participate in.\n\nThe Alternator is suitable for FDM, SLA & SLS printing and has been made to fit together very well. I have included Rotor-Hollow.STL and Stator-Hollow.STL for use in SLA & SLS printing technologies. The lesson includes pertinent information relating to settings needed while 3D Printing. I'd like to thank everyone for checking out my project and I am always thrilled to hear about my projects helping to teach kids and adults all over the globe. 3D Printing is a powerful technology and education is important for our youth. Lets make learning fun! ☺\n\nLesson Plan and Activity\n\nYou'll find a complete document attached to this model titled, \"3D Learn About - Alternator.PDF\". In this document, we will cover all aspects of an alternator from the inside out. Here are just a few of the topics covered in the included document:\n\nAlternating Current to Direct Current\n\n3-Phase Winding's\n\nBearings\n\nMagnets\n\nThis automotive alternator is built to scale with only a few minor modifications to allow it to be 3D printed in the classroom. It is a Bosch alternator from a Chevrolet truck and uses only 3 bolts to help fasten it together, the rest of the alternator is completely 3D printed.\n\nMaterials Needed\n\n(3) - M5x75mm/3\" bolts\n\n(3) - M5 Nuts\n\nSkills Learned\n\nautomotive\n\nelectromagnets\n\nvehicle\n\ngenerators\n\nalternators\n\nalternating current\n\ndirect current\n\nelectronics\n\nvoltage\n\npower\n\nDuration of Lesson\n\n1-2 Hours\n\nAlternator Video\n\nLearn about the 3D Printed Alternator"}
{"text": "When spacefaring adventurers think of \"A Fish Outta Water\", the Gillian race is one of the first to come to mind. Their small pelvic fins allow limited locomotion on land. It isn't the best form of transportation however, as Gillians are absurdly slow on land and tire easily from such a task. Rather fittingly, Gillians are at home in the water, being one of the fastest races capable of swimming.\n\nSecluded from the outside world due to life mainly underwater, Gillian tech is rather primitive in terms of advancements. Their armor consists of gilded coral, with a highly pressured air bubble attached as a helmet for traveling on land. A Gillian prefers to lure targets underwater where it normally has the advantage. It then proceeds to blast the target with a high voltage shock from its trident-like weapon.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, Gillians are cowardly during first encounters with the unknown, warming up after further inspection. When offered kindness (e.g. Food, trinkets, etc), they're quick to ally themselves with alien forces.\n\nThe heavy-hitter of the Gillian species, if a Sharkillian calls you chum, it could mean one of two things; a) You're a pal. b) You're lunch. For your sake, I hope you're of the former.\n\nThe physique of a Sharkillian is more robust than that of the average Gillian. Their strength is well-known throughout Gillian society and is the main militant force in their race's army. Aside from the usual stun-based weaponry, Sharkillians have no problems going unarmed into combat. Well equipped with a natural set of serrated teeth and muscle strength, Sharkillians strike fear into even prepared forces. Records show that a Sharkillian's bite force is strong enough to thrash steel bars, possibly even denser material. Their brutish attacks are like that of an Earth shark's feeding frenzy. Simply said, crazed, brutal violence.\n\nA Sharkillian's proficiency on the battlefield is only matched evenly by their appetites. In fact, the three square meals a day are a much celebrated past time for these voracious fish. Nothing like fresh meat with a side of Pebejelly dip to get a Sharkillian going. The kind of meat, doesn't matter much. Sharkillians aren't picky (barring their kin's meat. That's just wrong, man.). Some Sharkillians even dine on the go, ripping limbs off the enemy forces piece by piece. So long as the food's good, these sharkmen will keep on thrashing enemy ranks for the Gillian cause.\n\nThe tropical climate of Tethys is bountiful with fruity delicacies. The warm weather year round guarantees steady plant growth, enabling the flora to fully take in the sunlight. Beneath the waves, traditional Gillian crops are grown on the seafloor. These crops are both harvested and used to feed friendly farm mounts (Slaugeists). Docile Pebejellies also feed on these crops for sustenance, which in turn are also harvested for their gelatinous innards which all Gillians love with a slice of bread. All and all, a relaxing farming cycle.\n\nCoconuts, mangoes, and many more succulent fruits are grown on the island chains strewn out through the Gillian's home planet. Down below, sea cucumber, lettuce, and kelp are harvested for many exotic dishes. The Hyotl culture in particular have recently started trade with the Gillian race for their delectable sea vegetation.\n\nWeapon NO.: 3\n\nType: Gun\n\nSpeed: Normal\n\n\"Bubbles! Everyone likes bubbles! Except when they get in your eyes! Didn't see that coming, didja?\"\n\nWeapon NO.: 4\n\nType: Gun\n\nSpeed: Fast\n\n\"We...aren't even sure the Gillian race made this weapon. Apex donation maybe? Doesn't matter I guess. This weapon literally brings the meaning to 'lightning warfare'.\"\n\nWeapon NO.: 5\n\nType: Spear\n\nSpeed: Slow\n\n\"A trademark weapon of the Gillian army.

But conspiracy theorists have noticed worrying signs in some of her recent videos – and a mysterious Twitter invite to join her for a \"party\" in Bethnal Green, east London. The hashtag #savemarinajoyce started trending across the world overnight and the Met Police have been inundated with calls of concern. The bizarre situation comes in the wake of a series of horrific terror attacks and mass killings across Europe – and a chilling new Islamic State warning of attacks on the UK capital.\n\nTWITTER/@MARINAJOYCE7 POSE: Marina posts photos and videos on social media\n\n\"This is too coincidental\" @KaneStunts In Marina's latest Youtube video (below) from July 22 – entitled \"Date Outfit Ideas\" – she appears distracted, wide-eyed and nervous. She keeps looking off camera and at one point a finger comes into shot – as if someone is telling her exactly what to do. Between 12 and 14 seconds into the video, it sounds as if she whispers: \"help me\".\n\nIn one previous video what appears to be a gun can clearly be seen in the background. Fans have been expressing concern for Marina's welfare over the past few days. But a tweet from her in the early hours of Wednesday morning sent netizens into panic. The vlogger wrote: \"Meet me Bethnal Green at 6.30am if you would like to join partying with me at that event. \"Bring a friend so you don't get lost.\"\n\nTWITTER MYSTERIOUS: Marina's tweet, inviting people to Bethnal Green today\n\nThe hottest girls on Instagram You may not have heard of them before, but these girls are the HOTTEST women on Instagram. With millions of followers, see the girls who are taking social media by storm! 1 / 30\n\nMunich shooter Ali Sonboly lured children to their deaths by inviting them for free McDonalds – only for him to gun them down in cold blood. Some Twitter users fear someone has taken control of Marina's account and is using her as bait for a terror plot. User @KaneStunts shared tweets warning of a new terror attack on London with the post: \"This is too coincidental, do not go to Bethnal Green tomorrow.\" Another Twitter user, @trappedjai wrote: \"I'm honestly crying right now. \"Please everyone stay safe. \"I'm begging everyone to stay home.\"\n\nTWITTER/@MARINAJOYCE7 CREEPY: Marina and friends in 'Lolita' dresses\n\nTWITTER CONCERN: People tweet their fears about the Bethnal Green meet up\n\nTWITTER KILLER: Munich shooter Ali Sonboly\n\nPeople have been quick to point out a number of violent incidents around Bethnal Green. A 13-year-old was shot in Bethnal Green in April. One showbiz journalist, Joshua Fox, who lives in Bethnal Green even felt compelled to go out and look around the area.\n\nTWITTER POLICE: Showbiz journalist Joshua Fox even called police\n\nBut the Daily Star Online may be able to explain away the Tweet. Marina previously shared a link to a Facebook event for a morning, alcohol-free rave in London, called Morning Gloryville – which starts at 6.30am. It appears Marina may have just been inviting fans to come and dance with her.\n\nFACEBOOK ADVERT: The Facebook ad for Morning Gloryville – a morning rave in London\n\nConcern for Marina's wellbeing was so great overnight that the Daily Star Online can reveal the police has been out to check on her wellbeing. She already tweeted that she was OK back on Monday – but her fans continued to express concern. Police have visited her at home and confirmed she is safe and well.\n\nTWITTER REASSURANCE: Marina Joyce tweets that she is OK to fans\n\nTWITTER PHEW: Enfield police have confirmed Marina is OK"}

We have acted swiftly and decisively to demonstrate our commitment to a culture of decency, civility, and tolerance.\"\n\nKATHY GRIFFIN APOLOGIZES FOR PHOTO SHOOT\n\nThe company previously announced its partnership with Griffin on May 10 and launched a commercial featuring the spokeswoman.\n\nSquatty Potty, which designs bathroom products, is a small family business based in Utah that was previously featured on \"Shark Tank\" and is well-known for its viral social media ad campaigns. Edwards revealed the company has sold more than four million products in the U.S. to date.\n\nHowever, Griffin's troubles don't end there.\n\nTMZ reported Wednesday the gory photo has allegedly caught the attention of the Secret Service. While the federal law enforcement agency did not directly cite the image in any of its recent tweets, it did respond to Twitter users who reported the shocking picture online:\n\nThe Secret Service also issued a warning that may have hinted at the image:\n\nLaw enforcement sources told the celebrity gossip site the Secret Service has launched an investigation into \"the circumstances surrounding the photo shoot.\"\n\nEntertainment Weekly also reported on Tuesday that CNN has expressed disapproval of Griffin's gory photo and said it is \"evaluating\" whether she will continue to participate in the network's annual New Year's Eve coverage.\n\n\"We found what she did disgusting and offensive,\" a CNN spokesperson said in a statement. \"We are pleased to see she has apologized and asked that the photos be taken down.

{"text": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Peyton Manning can't stop shouting about Nebraska's largest city. The Denver Broncos quarterback used the word \"Omaha\" loudly and often during Sunday's playoff victory over the San Diego Chargers.\n\nAccording to an NFL.com video montage, Manning barked \"Omaha\" before the ball was snapped 44 times during the game.\n\nThe reason for the word choice, if there is one, is known only to Manning and the Broncos.\n\nBut it provided some unexpected publicity for the city of 427,000, perhaps best known as the home of both billionaire Warren Buffett and the Fortune 500 insurance company Mutual of Omaha (sponsor of the old TV show \"Wild Kingdom\").\n\n\"I think it shows Peyton Manning really loves Omaha,\" Mayor Jean Stothert said Monday. \"I'll personally take him on a tour. He has an official invitation now.\"\n\nOmaha was a trending topic on Twitter during the game, and the Greater Omaha Convention and Visitors Bureau jumped aboard, tweeting: \"We certainly appreciate all the love from Peyton Manning :)\"\n\nGreater Omaha Chamber of Commerce President and CEO David Brown said he was watching the game, and he wondered how his agency could capitalize.\n\nBrown said he wants to explore the possibility of hiring Manning, one of the sporting world's top pitchmen, to shoot a promotional ad for Omaha.\n\n\"We'd be foolish not to,\" Brown said, adding that he realizes Manning's fee probably would be prohibitive.\n\nIf anything, Omaha once conjured an image of a cow town on the banks of the Missouri River.\n\nBut Doug Parrott, executive vice president for the Nebraska-based Bailey Lauerman public relations and advertising firm, said that has changed over the years because of the prominence of Buffett and national media coverage of events such as the College World Series and U.S. Olympic Swim Trials.\n\nBrown said the chamber of commerce has worked hard to woo corporations to locate to \"the Big O,\" as locals call it.\n\nOmaha is home to five Fortune 500 companies, including Union Pacific Railroad, and sells itself on, among other things, a reasonable cost of living and dependable workforce.\n\nA chamber-commissioned study last year found that 100 million people had been exposed to the \"Omaha message\" in the past decade and that the city is generally viewed positively,\" Brown said.\n\n\"But when people are asked why they feel that way, they can't bring it to a single message,\" he said.\n\nQuarterback Tom Brady of the New England Patriots has been known to say \"Omaha\" during games and so has Peyton's brother, New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning.\n\n\"Sally,\" ''Alpha,\" and \"Kentucky\" are among the many words that amount to gibberish to the typical fan, and sometimes they truly mean nothing.\n\nBut the words often are a signal to the rest of the offense to change a play or scheme — and defenses sometimes try to crack the code.\n\nIt was apparent that the Chargers associated \"Omaha\" with Manning's snap count on Sunday because he lured five different San Diego players to jump offside, an unusually high number of penalties for the same infraction.\n\nFor the city of Omaha, the value of Manning's shout-outs is impossible to calculate, Parrott said.\n\nParrott noted, however, that air time for a 30-second Super Bowl ad is $4 million this year. If Manning leads the Broncos to the Super Bowl and yells \"Omaha\" as many times as he did Sunday, well, that's lots of free exposure.\n\n\"Commercials cost money to make, and you have to come up with the idea and hire a production company to make it. It could cost $4 million just for the production, and we get it for free,\" Parrott said.\n\n\"Everybody in Omaha really needs to root for Peyton to take down Tom Brady and the Patriots so we can hear 'Omaha' in the Super Bowl.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Arnie Stapleton in Denver and AP Sports Writer Mike Marot in Indianapolis contributed to this report."}

Jaish al-Fatah announced its formation this Tuesday, reported the pro-opposition Orient News on Tuesday, the same day it launched a offensive to take regime-controlled Idlib city.\n\nThe campaign to capture Idlib is particularly significant to Nusra, which reportedly wants the city as part of its plan to eventually carve out an al-Qaeda emirate in northern Syria.\n\nNusra may have contributed up to 3,000 men to the fight, in addition to US-manufactured TOW anti-tank missiles, likely looted from the US-backed, now-dissolved Harakat Hazm last month.\n\nFor more from Syria Direct, like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter."}
{"text": "While 'hope may not be a strategy,' neither is hyperbole and empty rhetoric\n\nAfter a disastrous overseas trip and much-deserved criticism for failing to even mention our military or our troops now fighting in America's longest war in Afghanistan in his nomination acceptance speech, Mitt Romney gave a \"major foreign policy speech\" in Virgina today, at the VMI military academy; trying to narrow the lead President Obama has enjoyed on foreign policy in recent polls.\n\nTrying to sustain the momentum he gained in last week's presidential debate, Romney's speech was titled: \"The Mantle of Leadership\" (full transcript), charging that President Obama has failed to lead. Criticizing the president, Romney declared that, \"Hope is not a strategy.\" Neither is empty rhetoric, Mitt.\n\nListening to the entire speech, I was struck by the total lack of specifics or substance in the speech, as Romney went through a factually challenged litany of Obama failures, from the attack on our consulate in Libya and the murder of Ambassador Stevens, to our lack of commitment to the Syrian rebels, to poorer American relations with Israel under Obama, to lack of resolve over preventing a nuclear Iran.\n\n\nRomney tried to link the consulate attack and murder of Ambassador Stevens to poor performance—or even neglect—by the Obama Administration relative to security against terrorist attacks, without providing any evidence to back that up. Citing the thousands of deaths in Syria under the Assad regime, Romney criticized our commitment to helping the rebels but offered no real rationale for further arming unknown—and possibly radical extremists—involved in the struggle. Didn't we hear the same concern coming from the right over getting involved in Libya and, thereby, arming Al Qaeda operatives there? Now proclaiming his commitment to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and a two-state solution; wasn't that the same Mitt Romney heard on that now infamous 'secret video' (where he dissed 47% of America) dismissing the chance of any lasting peace in the Middle East (VIDEO)? On Iran, Romney promised new, stronger sanctions, yet offered absolutely no details on what those would be, or how they would differ with those already imposed by the Obama Administration, which have virtually crippled Iran's economy and ravished the value of their currency. This is the same Mitt Romney who recently met with Israel's ultra-conservative Prime Minister, Benjamin \"Bibi\" Netanyahu, giving Israel tacit approval for an Israeli pre-emptive strike on Iran—now claiming that Obama's policies have, \"set back the hope of peace in the Middle East and emboldened Iran.\"\n\nJust as Romney 'jumped the gun' and—without any concern for the facts—criticized the Adminstration's response to the recent violent demonstrations in the Muslim World, arising from the provocative anti-Muslim video trailer released on the Internet, Romney charged, \"Unfortunately, this president's policies have not been equal to our best examples of world leadership.\"\n\nInterestingly, after previously citing Russia as our most dangerous 'geopolitical foe' and citing the trade challenges with China and weakness of Obama on their trade and currency practices in his campaign ads…Romney gave only passing mention to either nation in his speech!\n\nThe speech will continue to be analyzed throughout the coming days, but most military and political analysts have already cited it as misleading, lacking substance and unlikely to do much to either bring down Obama's strong poll position on foreign policy or boost Romney's. Especially considering some glaring factual errors. Namely that Obama has made \"deep and arbitrary cuts\" to the defense budget (despite defense spending increases), or that Obama \"hasn't signed a single free trade agreement in four years\" (despite the many refinements to the South Korea F.T.A. under Obama, finally bringing it into force this year).\n\nincredulously, implying American military weakness (despite the largest military budget in the world), Romney claimed that, \"The size of our Navy is at levels not seen since 1916,\" promising more naval ship building and carrier task forces in the Persian Gulf. I'm sure Romney's Neo-conservative advisors and the military-industrial complex were very, very pleased with his speech.

{"text": "Genocide according to The American Heritage Dictionary is defined as \"The deliberate destruction of an entire race or nation. The Holocaust conducted by the Nazis in Germany and the Rwandan genocide are examples of attempts at genocide.\"\n\n\nAn upcoming report from the \"U.S. Holocaust Museum\" will clearly define the actions of ISIS against the Yezidi and other minorities as genocide. Which, according to several reports, will be followed by the Obama admiration designating the actions of ISIS as genocide, in a few weeks.\n\n\nShould the United States declare the actions of ISIS genocide, then it requires the application of the UN convention against genocide, adopted in 1948. Unfortunately the UN convention is not specific on what that action should be. According to the convention:\n\n\n\"Article I: The Contracting Parties confirm that genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish\"\n\n\nThis convention describes what genocide is and who may be punished, from heads of state to private individuals. It does not however give any indication as to the extent the world powers may go to prevent or how to punish. This was evident in the past as actions in Bosnia, Rwanda and Darfur were defined as genocide and some of the perpetrators were caught and punished, long after the fact.\n\n\nWith the exception of Darfur actions has been after the fact and even in Darfur the combined UN/African Union mission is too small to effectively protect civilians. Additionally while the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar Bashir it is unlikely to ever be served.\n\n\nThere is no doubt that what ISIS is doing is genocide, they have admitted it, in the case of the Yezidi that they intend to destroy the people and the culture. The questions now are, why it has it taken the world so long to come to this conclusion and what do they intend to do.\n\n\nNow more than one year after the start of ISIS attacks into Iraq and the genocidal slaughter of the Yezidi, Christian, and Muslims who disagree, the US is prepared to declare it genocide. Then what? While the US did declare what happened in Darfur genocide a declassified State Department memo advised then Secretary of State Colin Powel that making \"a determination that genocide has occurred in Darfur would have no immediate legal--as opposed to moral, political or policy--consequences for the United States.\" The determination was however the first time a US official had called an ongoing conflict genocide.\n\n\nThe administration is going to study the report for a few weeks before making a determination. The problem is that by doing so the White House and the State Department are concerned that by declaring ISIS is committing genocide what will this do to the US commitment to Iraq from a military standpoint. Unlike Darfur the United States has a political stake and military forces on the ground.\n\n\nBy failing to declare genocide and committing all available resources to the fight the US and the rest of the world is condoning the actions of one of the most barbaric organization that has infected the world in a long time. The preamble to the UN resolution, formally known as \"The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide\" states \"in order to liberate mankind from such an odious scourge, international co-operation is required.\" International co-operation cannot happen if each county is more concerned over internal politics or ideology then about the moral correctness of position.\n\n\nThe Kurdish Peshmerga with the help of the US and anti-ISIS international coalition have just liberated the town of Shingal which will protect the Yezidis and allow them to return to their homes, but it will not eliminate ISIS. To do so will require a full out assault by multi-national forces who will not give up until all vestiges of ISIS are gone. Until that time the scourge of genocide will continue to haunt mankind and the failure of all nations to rid us of it will render all conventions and treaty's calling for its end as meaningless pieces of paper.\n\n\nPaul Davis is a retired US Army military intelligence and former Soviet analyst.

{"text": "David Cameron is being urged to renege on his pledge to stand down before the next general election amid claims from senior Tories that the candidates currently seeking to replace him are \"hopelessly ill-equipped\" to become the next Prime Minister.\n\nA senior Tory MP told The Independent on Sunday that he would raise the issue with Mr Cameron during private talks in Downing Street because of the \"great resentment\" the leadership speculation is causing the party.\n\nIn an apparently off-the-cuff remark in the run-up to the last election, Mr Cameron revealed that he would not seek a third term in No 10. He said if he were re-elected he would serve the full five years and then step down.\n\nNo 10 has insisted that Mr Cameron intends to stick by the pledge – and is determined to stay for \"the vast majority of the Parliament\". But there has also been speculation that the Prime Minister could quit soon after the EU referendum – perhaps as early as 2017.\n\nThe two frontrunners to succeed Mr Cameron – the Home Secretary, Theresa May, and the Chancellor, George Osborne – have been joined by a host of lesser-known ministers. The Education Secretary, Nicky Morgan, last year announced that she was considering standing, while the Business Secretary, Sajid Javid, has been heavily tipped as a standard bearer of the Thatcherite right.\n\nMinisters outside the Cabinet, including Priti Patel, Penny Mordaunt and Andrea Leadsom, have also been tipped. And Robert Buckland, the Solicitor General, last month said he could stand if no one from the One Nation wing of the party emerged.\n\nMeanwhile, Liam Fox, the former defence secretary who now sits on the back benches, has emerged as a contender after becoming the leading figure in the campaign for Britain to leave the EU.\n\nThe jockeying for position has sparked anger among Tory MPs, with a senior Tory saying Mr Cameron needed to order ministers to \"get back in their box or resign\" as it was beginning to dominate everything.He said: \"Boris is out of control. He's only got two or three supporters. Theresa's got a maximum of 10. George is the Crown Prince and is getting on with it, but most of us are 'none of the above', thank you.\"\n\nSpeaking to The IoS, Sir Alan Duncan, a former minister, said Mr Cameron's off-the-cuff remark during the election campaign had sparked an unhelpful focus on the Tory leadership.\n\nHe said: \"A casual comment in an interview should not be taken as permission for everyone to start playing leadership games. There is no enthusiasm for any sort of leadership antics at the moment. Anyone who is playing that game needs to realise that it is causing great resentment and it will backfire immediately.\n\n\"Most of those who are trying to put their name in the frame are hopelessly ill-equipped to step into the Prime Minister's shoes and should just shut up and back off.\"\n\nSir Alan's intervention comes after the former chancellor, Ken Clarke, admitted that he couldn't see any \"giants\" in the race to replace Mr Cameron. He also claimed that the next Tory leader could emerge from nowhere just a few weeks before Mr Cameron steps down.\n\nMr Clarke said Mr Johnson was \"undoubtedly the biggest personality on the block\", but he needed to develop a following not \"entirely [based] on his personality\". He added: \"The public loves Boris, but he has to answer the question, 'What would you do if you were Prime Minister?'\"\n\nWhen Mr Cameron announced that he would stand down before 2020, he claimed that reducing the deficit and fixing the economy was \"half done\" and he wanted to \"finish the job\" of education and welfare reform. But he said: \"There definitely comes a time where a fresh pair of eyes and fresh leadership would be good\", adding: \"I've said I'll stand for a full second term, but I think after that it will be time for new leadership. Terms are like Shredded Wheat – two are wonderful but three might just be too many.\"\n\n\nThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.\n\n\nSign our petition here"}
{"text": "Perceptions of Vulnerability and Changes in Behavior\n\nAbout two-thirds of investigative journalists surveyed (64%) believe that the U.S. government has probably collected data about their phone calls, emails or online communications, and eight-in-ten believe that being a journalist increases the likelihood that their data will be collected. Those who report on national security, foreign affairs or the federal government are particularly likely to believe the government has already collected data about their electronic communications (71% say this is the case), according to a new survey of members of Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) – a nonprofit member organization for journalists – by the Pew Research Center in association with Columbia University's Tow Center for Digital Journalism.\n\nThus far, concerns about surveillance and hacking have mostly fallen short of keeping many journalists from pursuing a story or a source; Just 14% say that in the past 12 months, such concerns have kept them from pursuing a story or reaching out to a particular source, or have led them to consider leaving investigative journalism altogether.\n\nStill, these concerns have led many of these journalists to alter their behavior in the past 12 months. Nearly half (49%) say they have at least somewhat changed the way they store or share sensitive documents, and 29% say the same of the way they communicate with other reporters, editors or producers.\n\nAnd among the 454 respondents who identify as reporters, 38% say that in the past year they have at least somewhat changed the way they communicate with sources.\n\nWhen it comes to external protection from digital threats like surveillance and hacking, these investigative journalists do not put much stock in their internet service providers (referred to as ISPs). Just 2% have \"a lot of confidence\" their ISP can protect their data from being accessed by unauthorized parties, while 71% have not much or no confidence at all.\n\nNews organizations get mixed reviews for their ability to protect the security of their employees' communications. Among those who work for news organizations (589 of the 671 journalists surveyed), half say their employer is not doing enough to protect journalists and their sources from surveillance and hacking, while about the same share (47%) says they are doing enough. Just 21% say their organization has taken steps or implemented policies in the past year to protect journalists and their sources, while 36% say their organization has not, and 42% do not know. About half (54%) report getting no formal training or instruction on electronic security issues from professional sources such as journalism associations, news organizations or journalism schools.\n\nStill, other issues are more pressing for the profession than surveillance and hacking. When asked to rank four challenges facing journalists today, an overwhelming majority (88%) of journalists identify decreasing resources in newsrooms as their top concern. No other issue comes close. Following far behind are: legal action against journalists (5%), electronic surveillance by governments or corporations (4%) and hacking targeted at journalists or news organizations (1%). Furthermore, relatively few journalists (27%) have spent at least \"some time\" in the past 12 months researching how to improve their electronic security.\n\nOverall, these data paint a complex picture in which investigative journalists on the whole feel vulnerable to surveillance and hacking, but not to the degree that most are changing their journalistic practices dramatically or investing energy into figuring out how to do so. And nearly all of those surveyed (97%) say that for today's journalists, the benefits of digital communication like email and cellphones outweigh the risks. Just 3% say the risks outweigh the benefits.\n\nAbout This Survey\n\nThe analysis in this report is based on an online survey conducted from December 3-28, 2014, with a representative sample of 671 journalists who are members of Investigative Reporters and Editors, Inc. (IRE). The 671 investigative journalists include a mix of reporters, producers, editors, data specialists, photojournalists and others, and comprise a wide range of coverage areas.\n\nThe survey was written and analyzed by Pew Research Center staff, and field work was conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates International (PSRAI). Email invitations containing individualized survey links to access the online study were sent to 2,723 investigative journalists in the United States who are members of IRE. Journalists also had the option of returning a print version of the survey through the mail. For more detailed information, see the Methodology section."}
{"text": "After the DEA moved to further constrain Americans' access to medically miraculous CBD oil by classifying it alongside heroin and cocaine, Britain chose compassion and common sense — and just classified cannabidiol (CBD) as a medicine.\n\nOn Monday, Britain's Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) decided CBD — which can treat illnesses and conditions from severe childhood epilepsy to autism to cancer — warranted the classification as a medicine based on credible evidence of its efficacy.\n\nThus, unlike in the U.S. — where the substance is now considered devoid of medical benefit by the DEA — CBD meeting quality and regulatory standards may be legally obtained by any British citizens who need it, reports High Times.\n\n\"We have come to the opinion that products containing cannabidiol (CBD) used for medical purposes are a medicine,\" an MHRA spokesperson said in a statement on the agency's website.\n\nOur primary concern is patient safety and we wish to reiterate that individuals using cannabidiol (CBD) products to treat or manage the symptoms of medical conditions should discuss their treatment with their doctor. MHRA will now work with individual companies and trade bodies in relation to making sure products containing CBD, used for a medical purpose, which can be classified as medicines, satisfy the legal requirements of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012.\n\nThis rational approach stands in sharp and tragic contrast to draconian drug laws in the U.S., where, as of January 13, CBD oil — which does not contain the psychoactive chemical THC, which gives people a high — and all cannabinoids will be considered dangerous substances.\n\nHealthcare and cannabis rights advocates have excoriated the DEA's brash and baseless move, noting lives will now be in jeopardy.\n\n\"The whole policy around this plant is just so illogical,\" Robert J. Capecchi, director of federal policies at the Marijuana Policy Project, told Vice. \"Even when you look at the criteria you're supposed to be looking at under the law, they're just not following it. It's just a stupid policy for lack of a better term.\"\n\nTHC-containing cannabis — also medically beneficial for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder, among many other conditions — still remains as a Schedule I substance in the U.S., and is not considered medicine in Britain.\n\nBut the latter has taken steps in the right direction with the new classification for CBD — a complete reversal of cease and desist orders sent by MHRA to vendors only months ago, as High Times notes, ordering it to be \"removed from sale in the UK.\"\n\n\"The change really came about with us offering an opinion that CBD is in fact a medicine,\" Gerald Heddel, director of inspection and enforcement at the agency, explained to Sky News, \"and that opinion was based on the fact that we noted that people were making some quite stark claims about serious diseases that could be treated with CBD.\"\n\nDecades of government propaganda about the putative dangers of 'marijuana' — amplified exponentially by President Nixon's administration's agenda to, in essence, criminalize black people and the anti-war left — still linger in the stigmatization of all the cannabis plant's myriad derivatives.\n\nDespite the DEA's war on cannabis and its users, onerous prohibition has been voted out in an increasing number of states — forcing those who need it to uproot their lives and move, in order not to face arrest over their medicine. Medical research into cannabis and cannabinoids continues to evince the miraculous assets the plant offers. In just one example, as High Times explains,\n\nIn early December, researchers from the University of Alabama found that CBD oil reduces both the frequency and severity of seizures in children and adults with with severe, intractable epilepsy. In two-thirds of the 81 participants, the severity was reduced by at least 50 percent.\n\nIn classifying CBD as medicine, MHRA recognizes such benefits — and the improved health of British citizens — eclipse the value in blindly continuing dangerous and inaccurate propaganda.\n\nSadly, the highly profitable war on drugs and influence of pharmaceutical corporations have the DEA feigning ignorance about cannabis and CBD — at the expense of people's lives.\n\nClaire Bernish writes for TheFreeThoughtProject.com, where this article first appeared."}
{"text": "'In Meat We Trust' Argues We Got The Meat Industry We Asked For\n\nEnlarge this image iStockphoto iStockphoto\n\nIn Meat We Trust An Unexpected History of Carnivore America by Maureen Ogle Hardcover, 368 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?\n\nThe meat on your dinner table probably didn't come from a happy little cow that lived a wondrous life out on rolling green hills. It probably also wasn't produced by a robot animal killer hired by an evil cabal of monocle-wearing industrialists.\n\nTruth is, the meat industry is complicated, and it's impossible to understand without a whole lot of context. That's where Maureen Ogle comes in. She's a historian and the author of In Meat We Trust: An Unexpected History of Carnivore America.\n\nOgle's book examines the pipeline that meat takes today from field to table by trying to understand its roots. She starts all the way back in Colonial America, when settlers found so much available land that they were able to raise livestock they could never have afforded in Europe. Meat, Ogle writes, became a status symbol in early America.\n\nMuch has been made of the ugly details of the modern meat industry, from Upton Sinclair's The Jungle to Michael Pollan's Omnivore's Dilemma to various exposes and articles on slaughterhouses. The industry's roots, though, stretch back more than a century, when Americans left their farms for the big cities, leaving a vast urban population with a cash income and a hankering for meat.\n\n\"As more people moved to cities, the gap between the amount of livestock and meat that could be produced constantly lagged the demand on the part of consumers,\" Ogle told me in a recent interview.\n\nOgle ties the rise of gigantic meat companies and industrial meatpacking facilities not to post-World War II subsidies and corporate takeovers, but to the rise of cities. Those urbanites wanted meat — and they wanted it cheap.\n\n\"As a result, farmers, and urban voters, and the USDA and politicians all agreed that farming in the United States needed to be much more efficient and needed to run more like a factory than what many people think a farm should be like,\" Ogle says. All \"in order to reduce farmers' production costs and, therefore, keep the cost of food down.\"\n\nThe demand for vast quantities of meat at cheap prices led to meat producers pushing for efficiency and squeezing every bit of profit from every animal. That meant the rise of giant feedlots fattening animals on corn feed, and huge meatpackers processing animals at factory speed and scale. The industrial meat system, Ogle argues, is a supply and demand problem.\n\n\"As long as the demand is there, we're going to continue to have these very large industrial systems, because that's the only way to satisfy demand,\" Ogle says. \"You're not going to satisfy demand with small farmers.\"\n\nIt's that kind of thinking that has opened Ogle up to frequent criticism on social media since the book was published on Nov. 12. In the introduction to the book, Ogle writes, \"The battles over production and consumption of meat are nearly as ferocious as those over gays, gun control and marriage.\" Now, Ogle is in the middle of vicious debates on the efficacy of the way meat is raised and processed. (Check the comments under recent interviews with WNYC's The Takeaway and Salon.)\n\nOgle has been accused of being a shill for big industry and of being anti-small farmer. But the book doesn't shy away from the realities of the modern meatpacking industry and presents it in realistic detail. Ogle says she doesn't want to pick a side, but merely present a nuanced look at an important issue that has been turned into political sound bites.\n\nUltimately, Ogle finds there is a fundamental disconnect in the way many of us view meat. We want it; we want it cheaply; we want it made in a place where we don't have to deal with the sights and sounds of slaughtering animals; and we don't want it to come from factory farms. Something, Ogle says, has to give."}
{"text": "A regulatory filing shows Aetna made more than $7 million in donations to conservative political groups.\n\nNEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Insurance giant Aetna inadvertently disclosed more than $7 million in donations to conservative political groups in a regulatory filing made earlier this year, according to a Washington-based advocacy group.\n\nDocuments obtained and distributed by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington show that Aetna made a $3 million donation to the American Action Network and a $4.05 million donation to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in 2011.\n\n\nAetna made the disclosure in a year-end regulatory filing with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, an organization that sets insurance industry standards and provides regulatory support.\n\nA subsequent amended filing, made in June, does not list the donations. The authenticity of the documents was confirmed to CNNMoney by the NAIC.\n\nAdvocates of campaign finance reform say the disclosures, first reported by trade publication SNL Financial, are extremely unusual, and represent the first known major donations from a publicly traded company to political organizations that are not required to reveal the source of their funding.\n\nAmerican Action Network is organized as a 501(c)(4) group, and has deep roots in conservative circles. Former Sen. Norm Coleman, a Republican from Minnesota, is on the board of directors, as is former Rep. Vin Weber, a member of Mitt Romney's economic team.\n\nThe Chamber of Commerce is Washington's most powerful business lobby. While the organization does not endorse candidates for president, it is expected to spend tens of millions of dollars this election cycle to influence other races.\n\nThe regulatory filing puts the insurance company in the unusual position of having voluntarily disclosed donations to groups that are attractive for the very reason that they do not reveal the source of their donations.\n\n\"I think Aetna screwed up. I don't think they needed to disclose this,\" said Melanie Sloan, the executive director of CREW, an advocacy group that opposes corporate political spending.\n\nAetna (AET, Fortune 500) provided CNNMoney with a letter from CEO Mark Bertolini that acknowledged donations to the groups, but claimed the funds were meant for educational purposes.\n\n\"No funds were provided to these organizations for lobbying purposes; however, we have provided funds to these organizations for educational activities,\" Bertolini said.\n\nBy law, American Action Network, a tax exempt group, must limit itself to \"charitable, educational, or recreational purposes.\" But in practice, the phrase \"educational activities\" is often used as a euphemism to describe so-called issue ads.\n\nIssue ads can indirectly express support for or opposition to a candidate but may not explicitly urge the viewer to vote for or against that candidate. Critics of such advertising call them thinly disguised campaign commercials.\n\n\"Educational activity is a term of art that has been applied to electioneering communication,\" said Kathy Kiely, a managing director at the Sunlight Foundation, a group that advocates for transparency in government.\n\n\"When they talk about education, you have to ask: 'Have you ever seen an advertisement from American Action Network that is not political?' \"\n\nAsked for documentation that supported Aetna's claim that the money was specifically donated for educational activities, Aetna referred CNNMoney to American Action Network and the Chamber.\n\nA representative from American Action Network would only say that the group does not discuss its donors, and the Chamber of Commerce did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSloan found Aetna's explanation unconvincing.\n\n\"Everyone knows what American Action Network does. And everyone knows what the Chamber does,\" Sloan said. \"This is all just a fiction.\"\n\nThe issue of political contributions is not a new one for Aetna.\n\nAt the company's annual shareholders meeting in May, an individual associated with the Service Employees International Union Master Trust submitted a proposal that called for the disclosure of additional information on political activity by the insurer.\n\nBertolini said that the company's disclosures are adequate.\n\n\"We agree that transparency and accountability are important,\" Bertolini said, adding that the company complies with all state and federal laws. \"We don't believe that additional disclosures are warranted at this time.\""}
{"text": "Three new studies released this month lent weight behind the increasingly popular idea that funneling money into fossil fuels is not only harmful for the environment, it's also potentially calamitous for the global financial system.\n\nReports by the U.K. government's Environmental Audit Committee, the European Union Parliament Greens-European Free Alliance Group and Canberra-based think-tank The Australia Institute all touched on what's known as the \"carbon bubble.\" The carbon bubble describes the overvaluation of fossil fuel assets that will have to be left unburned in order to limit Earth's surface temperatures to 2°C above the preindustrial level. To meet this 2 C (3.6 F) goal—a target agreed by governments in lieu of a more concrete plan to avoid dangerous climate change back in 2010—the majority of the current estimated reserves of oil, gas and coal will have to be left untouched to avoid harmful climate change. But instead of taking these climate policies and risks into account, growing numbers of climate campaigners, policy-makers and financial experts say that stock markets have instead inaccurately valued companies with large holdings of fossil fuels by assuming their assets will all be usable, when in fact they could be left stranded and devalued.\n\n\"Financial stability could be threatened if shares in fossil fuel companies turn out to be overvalued because the bulk of their oil, coal and gas reserves cannot be burnt without further destabilizing the climate,\" warned the U.K.'s EAC chair Joan Walley. The European study looked at the estimated risk for E.U. financial institutions face with a carbon bubble, finding that the exposure amounted to over $1.38 trillion. It concludes that \"a carbon bubble shock would cause significant losses for E.U. financial institutions,\" adding that \"the losses for all E.U. banks, insurance companies and pension funds combined would be €350-400 billion ($485 billion to $554 billion).\" The Australian Institute's report targets investors, particularly decision ]makers at religious funds, universities, public authorities and private foundations because of the supposed additional ethical or responsible investment obligations they may face.\n\nThe arguments put forward by these groups, especially in reframing the climate change debate in terms of financial risks, has been gaining ground for some time. Already institutions have taken notice, with the head of the OECD, Angel Gurría, stating that \"the looming choice may be either stranding those assets or stranding the planet.\" More promisingly still, Norway announced in February that it would set up an expert group to debate ending fossil fuel investments into its $840 billion sovereign wealth fund (gleaned from Norway's surplus oil wealth).Norway has already sold out of 27 coal and gold mine over environmental concerns. If Norway does decide to move out of other fossil fuels, it would throw huge weight behind the growing fossil fuel divestment movement.\n\nYet not everyone is convinced, including those that share environmental concerns. The basic premise of the carbon bubble, that governments ensure that we stay within 2 C (3.6 F) temperature rise, would in turn mean drastically cutting down on our carbon consumption. Economist Richard Tol points to the patchy and failing regulatory policies from the U.S. to the E.U. and China as evidence that the regulation has not gone far enough to make this a reality. Craig Mackenzie, head of sustainability at U.K.-based Scottish Widows Investment Partnership told the Guardian that the idea that fossil fuels pose a huge threat to the global economy is false. Mackenzie says that investors are already aware of the risks to share prices and will react accordingly if climate policies are more aggressively enforced. But, says Mackenzie, the most problematic aspect of the carbon bubble argument is the way it uses scaremongering tactics. \"Suggesting that action on climate change might cause economic melt down sounds to me like the kind of thing you might hear from the Tea Party Republicans not from the European green movement.\"\n\nThe more likely scenario, and one that is already playing out as a result of severe and unusual weather events around the world, is that climate change will strand assets in different sectors of the economy—making it a concern for far more than just fossil fuel companies. Ultimately one thing investors and climate campaigners will agree on is the need for clearer climate policies from governments to deal with and mitigate these changes, rather than uncertainty that fuels speculation and inaction."}
{"text": "Most economists agree that advances in robotics and AI over the next few decades are likely to lead to significant job losses. But what's less often considered is how these changes could also impact social mobility. A new report from UK charity Sutton Trust explains the danger, noting that unless governments take action, the next wave of automation will dramatically increase inequality within societies, further entrenching the divide between rich and poor.\n\nThe are a number of reasons for this, say the report's authors, including the ability of richer individuals to re-train for new jobs; the rising importance of \"soft skills\" like communication and confidence; and the reduction in the number of jobs used as \"stepping stones\" into professional industries.\n\n\"Traditionally, jobs like these have been a vehicle for social mobility.\"\n\nFor example, the demand for paralegals and similar professions is likely to be reduced over the coming years as artificial intelligence is trained to handle more administrative tasks. In the UK more than 350,000 paralegals, payroll managers, and bookkeepers could lose their jobs if automated systems can do the same work.\n\n\"Traditionally, jobs like these have been a vehicle for social mobility,\" Sutton Trust research manager Carl Cullinane tells The Verge. Cullinane says that for individuals who weren't able to attend university or get particular qualifications, semi-administrative jobs are often a way in to professional industries. \"But because they don't require more advanced skills they're likely to be vulnerable to automation,\" he says.\n\nSimilarly, as automation reduces the need for administrative skills, other attributes will become more sought after in the workplace. These include so-called \"soft skills\" like confidence, motivation, communication, and resilience. \"It's long established that private schools put a lot of effort into making sure their pupils have those sorts of skills,\" says Cullinane. \"And these will become even more important in a crowded labor market.\"\n\nRe-training for new jobs will also become a crucial skill, and it's individuals from wealthier backgrounds that are more able to do so, says the report. This can already be seen in the disparity in terms of post-graduate education, with individuals in the UK with working class or poorer backgrounds far less likely to re-train after university.\n\nThe report, which was carried out by the Boston Consulting Group and published this Wednesday, looks specifically at the UK, where it says some 15 million jobs are at risk of automation. But the Sutton Trust says its findings are also relevant to other developed nations, particularly the US, where social mobility is a major problem.\n\nSocial mobility is already a big problem in America\n\nOne study in 2016 found that America has become significantly less conducive to social mobility over the past few decades. \"It is increasingly the case that no matter what your educational background is, where you start has become increasingly important for where you end,\" one of the study's authors, Michael D. Carr, told The Atlantic last year. Another report found that around half of 30-year-olds in the US earn less than their parents at the same age, compared to the 1970s, when almost 90 percent earned more.\n\nIt's important to note, though, that there is disagreement about how bad the impact of automation on the job market will be. Some reports have suggested that up to 50 percent of jobs in developed countries are at risk, while others point out that only specific tasks will be automated — rather than whole professions. Economists also note that new categories of jobs are likely to be created, although exactly what, and how many, is impossible to accurately predict.\n\nThe Sutton Trust report also says that there is some reason to be optimistic about the coming wave of automation, particularly if governments can encourage people to train for STEM professions (those involving science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).\n\n\"From a social mobility perspective there are two important things about the STEM sector,\" says Cullinane of the UK job market. \"Firstly, there doesn't seem to be a substantial gap in the income background of people taking STEM related subjects, and secondly, there isn't a resulting pay gap for those who come from different backgrounds. If the STEM sector is going to be the main source of growth over the medium to long term, that's a real opportunity to leverage social mobility there.\""}
{"text": "China has removed a controversial animal test requirement for some types of cosmetics, a move praised by animal rights advocates who hope it signals an end to a practice widely scorned elsewhere.\n\nStarting Monday, the China Food and Drug Administration will stop requiring animal tests on so-called ordinary cosmetics, including shampoos and certain skin-care products. Instead, manufacturers can opt for alternative methods using existing data on ingredient toxicology or tissue culture when they conduct risk assessments.\n\nThe new rule does not apply to imported products or any special-use products, including hair dyes and sunblocks. While some industry specialists have cautioned against interpreting this policy shift to mean any big changes in practice in the short term, animal welfare advocates were quick to welcome the development.\n\nOn Sunday, more than 50 members of an international anti-animal testing movement celebrated on the streets of Dalian, a coastal city in Liaoning Province in northeastern China. Wearing bunny ears, the campaigners carried 100 cardboard cut-outs of rabbits, the animal most used in cosmetics testing, at the city's iconic Xinghai Plaza and invited members of the public to pose for photos with them.\n\n\"It's a significant departure,\" said Troy Seidle, director of research and toxicology for the Humane Society International, one of the nongovernmental organizations behind the Be Cruelty-Free campaign in China and co-organizer of the Dalian event. \"Certainly it's the first time we've seen an animal test requirement being removed from Chinese regulations for cosmetics,\" he added.\n\nAs many as 300,000 rabbits, guinea pigs, mice and other animals are used to test cosmetics in China every year, according to the Humane Society International.\n\nChina began requiring safety supervision of cosmetics in 1990, when it required that all special-use products be tested on animals for skin and eye irritation before they could be placed on the market.\n\nIn February 2012, the China Food and Drug Administration extended mandatory animal testing to the ordinary products, effectively shutting a multibillion-dollar market to international manufacturers like The Body Shop and Lush cosmetics, both based in Britain, which were committed to nonanimal testing methods.\n\nChina has a fast-growing market in cosmetics, importing nearly $1.7 billion last year, up 10.7 percent from the year before.\n\nFollowing the 2012 regulatory change, some foreign companies, like Avon and Estée Lauder, loosened their no-animal testing policy in order to continue to sell in China.\n\nEstée Lauder said it was simply heeding a foreign law by paying for animal tests on their products in a government-mandated laboratory in China, but critics assailed the company's practice.\n\n\"For decades Estée Lauder enjoyed the support of consumers who believed the company's ban on animal tests was permanent,\" Kathy Guillermo, senior vice president at People for Ethical Treatment of Animals, an advocacy group, said in an email. \"When the company quietly resumed its support for animal tests, it did not bother to inform those consumers.\"\n\nDespite the attention and raised expectations among animal rights groups, the celebration in Dalian was accompanied by an understanding that China is still a long way from ending animal tests.\n\n\"The regulation was written with certain caveats (i.e. other technologies need to be available, etc.),\" Erin H. Hill, vice president for program development at the Institute for In Vitro Sciences, wrote in an email. \"Since many of these have not been met, it is likely that the C.F.D.A. will continue to conduct their post-market surveillance as they have in the past.\"\n\nIn its 2013 announcement of the changes, the national drug safety regulator required provincial food and drug regulators to run sample testing on new products after the manufacturer has filed its toxicology statement. Lack of the know-how and the right materials for in vitro testing — procedures using tissues rather than live animals — means some manufacturers will most likely fall back to animal testing.\n\n\"You can change the policy but whether the day-to-day testing practice is going to change is still anyone's guess,\" said Mr. Seidle. \"It is going to be very slow-go for the time being,\" and \"we can't expect China to get there overnight. It's just not reasonable.\""}

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Sunday called on \"all parties to exercise their responsibility to preserve the cultural heritage of Mali,\" saying the attacks \"are totally unjustified.\"\n\nIrina Bokova, head of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, on Saturday urged the Ansar Dine fighters \"to stop these terrible and irreversible acts\" after militants smashed mud-walled tombs in Timbuktu.\n\nOn Monday, the Islamists, who claim allegiance to Al Qaeda, tore open the door to the Sidi Yahia mosque, telling townspeople they were wiping out \"idolatry\" at the monuments to Sufi Islamic saints and scholars.\n\n\"In legend, it is said that the main gate of Sidi Yahia mosque will not be opened until the last day [of the world],\" said the town imam, Alpha Abdoulahi, according to Reuters news agency, which reached him in Timbuktu by telephone.\n\nIn radio and television interviews from Senegal, the newly appointed chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Fatou Bensouda, warned the rebels that destruction of religious and cultural heritage could lead to war crimes charges.\n\n\"The only tribunal we recognize is the divine court of Sharia,\" the Associated Press quoted Ansar Dine spokesmen Oumar Ould Hamaha as saying in response to Bensouda's warning.\n\nThe AP said Hamaha justified the destruction as a divine order to pull down idolatrous constructions \"so that future generations don't get confused, and start venerating the saints as if they are God.\"\n\nTimbuktu had been developed as a tourist attraction, with locals operating hotels, guest houses and guided tours for visitors to the ancient sub-Saharan trading post and Islamic educational center.\n\nHamaha told the AP that Ansar Dine opposes tourists' coming to the religious sites, saying they \"foster debauchery.\"\n\nUNESCO put Timbuktu and the nearby Tomb of Askia on its List of World Heritage in Danger last week, after the Ansar Dine rebels seized the region that has been beset by a three-way civil war since a March 22 coup deposed Mali's government. The Islamist radicals have been fighting for territory with Taureg separatists since the latter defeated Mali government troops in the spring, leaving the capital Bamako rudderless and incapable of putting down either rebellion in the remote north.\n\n\"Timbuktu was an intellectual and spiritual capital and a center for the propagation of Islam throughout Africa in the 15th and 16th centuries,\" UNESCO notes on its website. \"Its three great mosques, Djingareyber, Sankore and Sidi Yahia, recall Timbuktu's golden age.\"\n\nThe sites designated as important cultural heritage represent \"the power and riches of the empire that flourished in the 15th and 16th centuries through its control of the trans-Saharan trade,\" UNESCO recalls in its description.\n\nFundamentalist Salafist Muslims have also attacked Sufi heritage sites in Libya and Egypt over the past year, and Al Qaeda-allied Taliban militants a decade ago blew up two 6th Century Buddha figures carved into a mountainside near Bamiyan, in central Afghanistan, on the same grounds that they idolized false gods.\n\nALSO:\n\nWar crimes court staff accused of spying released in Libya\n\nNew 'green-on-blue' attack in Afghanistan kills 3 British troops\n\nWife of former Tunisian dictator apologizes, denies wrongdoing\n\n-- Carol J.

{"text": "SEATTLE — A lawsuit filed Thursday accuses Seattle Mayor Ed Murray of sexually molesting a teenage high-school dropout in the 1980s, and in interviews with The Seattle Times, two other men claim he abused them.\n\nThe mayor denied the allegations through his personal spokesman Jeff Reading.\n\n\"These false accusations are intended to damage a prominent elected official who has been a defender of vulnerable populations for decades,\" said a statement issued by Reading. \"It is not a coincidence that this shakedown effort comes within weeks of the campaign filing deadline. These unsubstantiated assertions, dating back three decades, are categorically false.\"\n\nMurray was elected mayor in 2013 after a long career in the Legislature, where he led efforts to legalize gay marriage in the state. As mayor he pushed to increase the city's minimum wage to $15 an hour and address the homelessness crisis in Seattle.\n\nIn the lawsuit filed in King County Superior Court, a 46-year-old man, identified only by the initials, D.H., said Murray \"raped and molested him\" over several years, beginning in 1986 — when he was 15 and addicted to crack cocaine, and when Murray was in his early 30s.\n\nThe man said he met Murray on a city bus, and Murray invited him back to his apartment, propositioning him for sex and haggling over the price.\n\nMurray paid him $10 to $20 for each of at least 50 encounters over the next four to five years, the lawsuit said.\n\n\"I have been dealing with this for over 30 years,\" the man, now sober for a year, told the Times.\n\nHe said he was coming forward as part of a \"healing process\" after years of \"the shame, the embarrassment, the guilt, the humiliation that I put myself through and that he put me through.\"\n\nThe man also said his father's recent death freed him of a desire to keep the abuse secret.\n\nThe newspaper also reported that two other men said they knew Murray when they lived in a Portland, Oregon, center for troubled children. Jeff Simpson and Lloyd Anderson accused Murray of abusing them in the 1980s and paying them for sex and said they'd be willing to testify about it, the Times said.\n\nThe Times said one of them talked with a social worker and detective at the time. No charges were filed and an entry in an old Multnomah County district attorney's database indicates the office considered but rejected a felony third-degree sodomy case in May 1984. Any other police and child welfare records would have been destroyed by now, officials said.\n\nSimpson and Anderson raised the allegations a decade ago in calls to reporters and Washington state lawmakers, and they repeated them in recent interviews with the Times.\n\nReading's statement acknowledged those accusations.\n\n\"The two older accusations were promoted by extreme right-wing anti-gay activists in the midst of the marriage equality campaign, and were thoroughly investigated and dismissed by both law enforcement authorities and the media,\" the statement said.\n\nSimpson, 49, said Murray — whom he thought of as a father — raped him over several years, starting at age 13, and in later years, paid him.\n\n\"I would really like for him to admit it and to take responsibility,\" Simpson told two Times reporters who visited him unannounced in Portland. \"I don't necessarily think that he destroyed my life but I believe a lot of the problems I have stemmed from this.\"\n\nSimpson tried to bring a lawsuit against Murray in 2007, with Anderson's support, but his lawyer withdrew from the case. In 2008, Simpson started calling media organizations and lawmakers in Olympia, saying Murray, then a state senator, was a pedophile who had sexually abused him.\n\nBefore his political career, Murray — one of seven children in an Irish Catholic family — considered the priesthood. He spent a year at a seminary in 1976 before studying sociology at the University of Portland, a private Catholic institution, according to news profiles.\n\nHaving sex with a child under 16 — the age of legal consent in Washington in 1986 and today — constitutes rape of a child under state law. The statute of limitations on any crime would have expired long ago.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and says D.H. has not previously made any financial demands of Murray."}
{"text": "New St. Pete Pier\n\nFor the second time in two years, St. Petersburg, Florida, is looking to transform its pier into a destination park.\n\nIs the pier park the new riverwalk? For years, it seemed that all cities could talk about were waterfront developments. Encouraged by the success seen in San Antonio above all, cities such as Philadelphia and Milwaukee have invested in their own historic riverwalk programs. Riverwalks aren't going anywhere. (Philadelphia, in particular, is ramping up to build some dramatic developments along the Schuylkill River.) But in several cities—namely New York, London, and Washington, D.C.—the most exciting new water-themed developments are taking a different shape. In Florida, St. Petersburg has just announced eight finalist designs for the city's proposed New St. Pete Pier, the latest iteration of the historic St. Petersburg Pier. First built in 1889 as a railroad tressle, the city's pier has evolved several times over the last 125 years. The finalist designs under consideration are below. There's one problem with these pier designs: St. Petersburg has tried to build this kind of pier park before. And only last year, it was struck down by residents.\n\nYet the Concerned Citizens of St. Pete, the organization that rallied the opposition to the Lens proposal, appears to approve of the next-generation round of finalists currently under consideration. What the latest designs share in common—and what distinguishes the eight finalists from the Lens design approved in 2012 and overruled in 2013—is the preservation of the signature Inverted Pyramid design built back in 1973.\n\nThis saga is quite different from the NIMBY-style opposition that's greeted some reuse projects attempted by U.S. cities in recent years. For starters, St. Petersburg was ahead of the curve: Decades before the High Line opened, the city had already converted an aging piece of infrastructure into a cultural amenity. And that's the pier that people liked. The Concerned Citizens of St. Pete disapproved of Michael Maltzan's design specifically, and of changing the Inverted Pyramid scheme generally. Voters seemed to agree with the Concerned Citizens. While pro-Lens activists complained that the ballot referendum was poorly worded—asking voters to vote yes in order to say no—nearly two-thirds did so nevertheless. The preservation requirement for the 1973 Inverted Pyramid pavilion may prove to be a burden on the site, limiting its potential as a new landmark destination. After all, the New St. Pete Pier still has to do all the things required of a brand new pier park, such as Pier 44 in New York (designed by Heatherwick Studio) or the 11th Street Bridge Park in D.C. (designed by OMA and OLIN)—just without a fancy design scheme to carry all those new features.\n\nConsider Destination St. Pete Pier, one of the eight finalists. The legend for the diagram includes (but is not limited to): a fishing pier, tram stops, a water taxi stop, kayak docks, a \"Grand Hammock,\" restaurants, waterfalls, a small-event lawn, retail, and other kinds of spaces. All of these new uses are anchored to a central design that St. Petersburg has lived with for decades. This design entry isn't alone in reusing the Inverted Pyramid scheme. (Some of the finalists offer more pronounced adaptations.) Like all the other finalists, this one adds tons and tons of programming to the pier. It seems to be a requirement of off-shore parks that they offer all things to all people. \"As you walk toward the Pier Head, you will encounter a new, unique St. Petersburg experience every 60 seconds,\" the entry promises. What remains to be seen is whether St. Petersburg can build enough support for what may be, in the end, a pricey renovation of a 1970s design. Now, the city will ask residents to rally around a more modest scheme, one that includes all the bells but none of the whistles, as it were. This approach might very well work. (And St. Petersburg deserved kudos for pivoting fast to a new plan for addressing the pier, whose pyramid is aging and pier approach crumbling.) If the scaled-down pier park concept fails to inspire people, though, the city might be out of options."}
{"text": "Don't be fooled by counterfeit imitations when completing your game library.\n\nBootleg games are illegal copies of legitimate games. There are four quick and easy ways to spot if a Nintendo DS cartridge is a bootleg. If suspicious, check multiple items – not all bootlegs will have the same flaws.\n\n#1 – Cartridge won't boot in a Nintendo DSi unit:\n\nAs the newest version of the DS system on the market, the Nintendo DSi includes a newer version of the operating system from the manufacturer that does a better job at detecting bootleg software and rejecting it with an error message. After launching the game, you'll see the message below displayed on the bottom screen.\n\nNon-booting DS screen\n\n\nPower down the system, remove the cartridge and re-insert it. Power the system back on and try to launch the game. If you receive this error again, it's very likely you have a bootleg game.\n\n\n#2 – Cartridge Construction is of low quality:\n\nTwo things you can quickly check without having a Nintendo DSi handy is the quality of the cartridge's construction. First, with any Nintendo DS cartridge you'll notice a seam down the middle of the side. If you tug on this with a fingernail, the cartridge should not separate at all. If it does, you've got a bootleg.\n\nBack of cartridge\n\n\nSecond, look at the back of the cartridge. Here, you see a bootleg cartridge on the left and a real cartridge on the right. Inside the Nintendo Racetrack logo, you'll notice that outlined in blue, the real cartridge has the registered trademark logo ® after the word \"Nintendo\". This is missing from the bootleg. Also, above the gold contact points, there are white letters and numbers. While the letters in this picture say \"Nintendo\", not all cartridges will – but all legitimate cartridges will have white letters above these gold contact points.\n\n\n#3 - Matching the Serial Numbers:\n\nEach published title has a serial number unique to itself. This serial number can be found on the front of the cartridge and on the back of the game case, next to the UPC. On the cartridge, you''ll find the serial number in the format of NTR-XXXX-YYY, where XXXX is the unique serial number for that game, and YYY represents the region, such as USA.\n\nSerial numbers\n\n\nOn the back of the game case, you''ll find the serial number again, in the format of NTR-P-XXXX, again where XXXX is the unique serial number. These two serial numbers will always match on a legitimate copy of the game. Also, compare this serial number to the string of letters printed in black on the back of the cartridge. The first four letters on the back will always match this serial number as well.\n\n\n#4 – The Case of the Odd Case:\n\nThere are three types of DS Game Cases. The standard US case is black and has a slot for holding Game Boy Advance games that is solid. Newer \"eco-friendly\" DS cases have no GBA slot and feature a cut-out recycling symbol behind the manual. The Japanese case is black and has a slot for holding Game Boy Advance games that is in three pieces. The European case is clear and thicker, to accommodate game manuals in multiple languages. Games sold in the US are NEVER sold in the European style cases and rarely ever sold in the Japanese style cases. While there are a few exceptions to the Japanese cases, if you spot a US game in a Japanese case, it should draw your attention to look at the game itself more closely.\n\nEuropean vs. US case\n\n\nJapanese vs. US case\n\n\nNew style US case\n\n\nIn the photo on the left, you'll see a European-style DS case on the left side and a US-style DS case on the right side. In the photo on the right, you'll see a Japanese-style DS case on the left side and a US-style DS case on the right side.\n\nYou can find further information about Nintendo's Anti-Piracy program on the official website. There are tips on how to identify counterfeit software for all consoles, not just the DS family, and photos for each category too."}
{"text": "Plug Pulled On 'Plan B,' House Breaks For Christmas\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jacquelyn Martin/AP Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner was dealt a major defeat Thursday night. After spending most of the week trying to round up votes for his \"Plan B\" to extend tax cuts for virtually everyone, he pulled the measure without a vote and sent the House home for Christmas. The clock keeps ticking toward the end of the year, when automatic tax increases and spending cuts are set to hit.\n\nEarly Thursday, Boehner expressed confidence not only that his bill would pass but that the Democratic-controlled Senate would feel so much pressure, it would be forced to consider it, too.\n\n\"I am not convinced at all that when the bill passes the House today that it will die in the Senate,\" Boehner said early Thursday.\n\nIt turns out he was wrong — very wrong. And the problem was his fellow Republicans. Boehner's bill would have extended tax cuts for income up to a million dollars. But it also would have raised taxes on those who make more than that.\n\nThat made some conservatives, like Rep. Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, uncomfortable.\n\n\"I want to protect everybody,\" Mulvaney said. \"I think everybody pays too much in taxes so I am looking for some way to protect everybody.\"\n\nAround the time the bill should have been up for a vote, Boehner gathered his conference in the basement of the Capitol and told them he wouldn't bring it up. His whip team had counted the votes, and they didn't have enough.\n\n\"He couldn't get the votes for this proposal,\" said Steve LaTourette, a retiring representative from Ohio. \"At the end of the day, you can't make people vote.\"\n\nMany of the unconvinced were freshmen elected in the Tea Party wave of 2010.\n\nRep. Tim Huelskamp of Kansas, the most vocal of the bunch, said the speaker was asking his members to take a vote that violated conservative principles. The conservatives rebelled.\n\n\"This is not Republican material,\" said Huelskamp. \"I think that's probably why they wisely pulled the plug and said, 'OK, let's regroup.' But regroup and reassess — you know, what exactly do Republicans stand for? — and pushing things that we can pull together on instead of divide ourselves on.\"\n\nThe speaker is stuck, said LaTourette. \"He can only play with the cards he's dealt. The voters have populated our conference with this set of representatives, and he does his best to work with them. But sometimes your best isn't good enough in the face of some people that just don't want to find common ground.\"\n\nJack Pitney, a professor of politics at California's Claremont McKenna College, feels for Boehner.\n\n\"To quote the great philosopher John Belushi in Animal House, my advice to the speaker: 'start drinking heavily,' \" he said.\n\nPitney can't figure out why the speaker would make such a public push if he didn't have the votes lined up to begin with.\n\n\"If he brings a proposal to the president, the president's going to say, 'Look John, how do I know you're going to get the support of the members of your conference?' That's an extremely weak hand to be presenting when you're dealing with the president. Where this ends up, I don't know,\" Pitney said.\n\nTo those on the inside, the end game isn't any clearer.\n\nCalifornia Rep. Buck McKeon, a Boehner ally, walked out of the conference meeting discouraged, saying, \"I don't know how we can get out of this mess.\"\n\nMcKeon added that the speaker might not get any credit for it, but Boehner wants to do what is right. \"And he thinks with divided government we should be able to do big things, and we can't do anything, and this is really, really sad,\" McKeon said.\n\nThe White House issued a statement late Thursday night saying the president will work with Congress and hopes to find a bipartisan solution quickly.\n\nThere's not much time left.

But fire officials say they are certain it is human-caused.\n\n\"I saw this boy lob a smoke bomb down into the ravine,\" hiker Liz FitzGerald told Willamette Week. \"I saw his friend or a guy that was there with him videotaping it with his phone. I looked over, and I said, 'Do you realize how dangerous that is?' \"\n\nFitzGerald said she got out of harm's way and helped police track down the group of teenagers.\n\nThe flames have led to the closure of part of Interstate 84. Hundreds of homes have been evacuated so far in Oregon and neighboring Washington state, and officials say more could be coming.\n\n\"Fire burning right along a major interstate, closing 40 miles of road, threatening homes — this is a big deal,\" Dave Thompson, a spokesman for the Oregon Department of Transportation told The Oregonian. \"This happened fairly suddenly. It blew up.\"\n\nThe blaze, ignited along a popular hiking trail, moved quickly enough to strand more than 140 hikers Saturday in the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, according to local media.\n\nThe Spokesman-Review reports that the hikers banded together to ensure nobody was left behind, and that when one person struggled, the group would stop to provide assistance. An Air Force medic and a U.S. Forest Service worker met up with the group and helped coordinate a rescue.\n\nFirefighters hovering overhead in a helicopter were able to lower directions toward a safe passage via a yellow ribbon.\n\nAs the group tried to make its way out, according to the newspaper, the flames came as close as 300 yards. They hiked into the night, some people using their cellphones to light the way over creeks and bridges. At one point, they lay down to rest.\n\n\"Some people were trembling. We were all cold on the ground,\" hiker Merribeth Midtlyng told the newspaper. \"A bear actually came into our area and no one stirred. ... After all we'd been through, it seemed irrelevant to our circumstances.\"\n\nA group of firefighters armed with provisions reportedly reached the group by early morning Sunday and led them 11 miles toward waiting buses that took them to safety.\n\nOregon Public Broadcasting reported Wednesday that the fire was at 0 percent containment. Fire officials say the estimated containment date is not until the end of the month.\n\n\"Though fire activity slowed Wednesday morning, it still threatens numerous communities, tourist attractions and resources in Oregon's scenic Columbia River Gorge. Those include the Bull Run Watershed, the source of 1 in 5 Oregonians' drinking water,\" OPB reports.\n\nSince it began over the weekend, the Eagle Creek Fire has merged with a second blaze, called the Indian Creek Fire. On Tuesday night, the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office tweeted that \"the fire has slowed way down for now.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service Portland said early Wednesday that thanks to shifting winds, the ash that had been raining down on parts of the city Tuesday should be ending and that the air quality should be improving.\n\nThe Eagle Creek Fire is one of dozens of wildfires burning across the Western United States. The Oregonian has compiled an interactive map of all of the current active wildfires across the West.\n\nThe New York Times reports:\n\n\"Meteorologists say it has been an unusually dry summer in a region known for rain. It has not rained significantly in Seattle since June ... and meteorologists say it has been more than 50 days since measurable precipitation fell in Portland, Ore.\""}
{"text": "Sonic Boom officially welcomed the public to its brand-new space in the Robertson Building at 215 Spadina Ave. last month (and held a massive funeral party for its former Honest Ed's digs ). The change of address for the iconic record store, which has spent the last 13 years serving audiophiles in the Annex , with a newer location in Kensington Market , comes reluctantly after the sale of Mirvish Village forced them to vacate the lower portion of Honest Ed's . Thankfully, the big move hasn't wiped out the store's inventory or aesthetic.\n\nMany frantic hours were spent prepping the new Boom for its grand opening on September 27. The space was most recently used as an American Apparel factory outlet , and while the staff already had their work cut out for them to exorcise the ghosts of improperly dyed metallic jeggings from the premises, an equally difficult task was combining inventory from two separate stores into one unified location.\n\nAs you may recall, Sonic Boom's original Bloor Street flagship was bigger than the one in Honest Ed's, hence the second branch in Kensington Market to house the overflow of vinyl and old-school paraphernalia. But with these new digs measuring a solid 13,000 square feet and centrally located on the southern edge of Chinatown, it made sense to bring everything together under one roof again.\n\nWalking up Spadina's east side, I was immediately greeted by the storefront's expanse of large windows, one emblazoned with the distinctive orange and blue logo. These massive glass panes will soon be filled with Sonic Boom's signature window displays designed by Tim Oakley, but for now they let a flood of sunlight wash over the front room. High ceilings and exposed wooden beams make for a decidedly more urban-chic feel than previous iterations of the shop.\n\n\"The top floor is kind of a smaller representation of the store as a whole,\" says owner Jeff Barber. It has a little of everything, including new releases on CD and vinyl, audio accessories like Urbanears headphones and Crosley turntables, plus Herschel bags and other fashion accessories. The entirety of their book collection is shelved along the back-right wall, with a pretty replete catalogue of 33â…\" paperbacks that's tough not to geek out over.\n\nThe merch on this level is accented with a bit of quirky decor that'll be new to you unless you visited the Bathurst location during it's final days. The \"Captain Fantastic\" Elton John pinball machine is charming and totally makes sense in the midst of all this vintage music gear; the animatronic stuffed bear looming over a container of batteries may need to be explained to me, though.\n\nDescending down the stairs at the back of the room leads me into the vastly bigger basement, which contains the bulk of the music selection. The rows-upon-rows of new and used stock will be totally recognizable to any previous Sonic Boom patron - every music genre is still well-represented here, though with particular emphasis on rock and indie.\n\nA pretty sizable DVD and Blu-ray collection is starting to fill out the front half of the room, while display cases towards the back show off cool box-set and oddball collectables (for example: thanks to this setup, I now know that a Celine Dion/Anne Geddes collabo exists. Amazing).\n\nThat back end of the basement is where Sonic Boom will continue the tradition of in-store concerts, which in the past have featured the likes of Dinosaur Jr., Sloan, Aimee Mann and The Weakerthans , just to name a handful. The stage isn't set up yet, but the stack of guitar amps and mic stands against the wall are a sure enough sign of live tunes to come.\n\nLeaving the Annex behind was surely a tough sell for both Sonic Boom's customers and crew, who've come to consider the store an integral part of the neighbourhood. But the new address' increased foot traffic, expanded space and close proximity to Queen and Spadina's many hip hangouts should ensure that not much will change for Toronto's largest independent music shop. \"We're sad to leave the Annex,\" Barber says, \"but we're excited about becoming a part of this neighbourhood.\"\n\nWriting by Shazia Khan.

{"text": "With local crews preparing boats for the reopening of the Texas shrimp season in about a week, the Brownsville-Port Isabel shrimp fleet once again received a much-needed blessing Wednesday courtesy of Father Mark Watters.\n\nIn the shade of a large, open-air shed at Zimco Marine on the Brownsville shrimp basin, diesel exhaust fumes from the idling trawler \"Miss Opal\" borne through the crowd by a stiff south wind, Watters led prayers against the industry's tough times and the negative emotions they produce, and delivered a rousing sermon in the manner of a coach's pre-game pep talk.\n\n\"Use the fear and turn it into fuel to praise God and change your life forever,\" he insisted.\n\nWatters also prayed for a bountiful harvest and safety for crew members before boarding the cheerfully festooned Miss Opal for a circuit around the basin's white-capped waters to bless individual vessels and crews.\n\nThe crowd of several dozen included Brownsville Navigation District Commissioner Ralph Cowen and Chairman John Wood, Texas Department of Agriculture assistant commissioner for Water and Rural Affairs Dan Hunter, and Bobby Champion Jr., Texas Coastal Marketing coordinator for the agricultural department.\n\nGary Graham, a professor and marine fisheries specialist with Sea Grant Texas at TexasA&MUniversity, was also in attendance, and said that excessive freshwater in the bays due to heavy spring rains has hindered development of the brown shrimp that the local fleet largely depends on.\n\nNot just the size but also the volume of shrimp appears to have been affected, he said.\n\n\"I'm concerned with the overall number of shrimp that are going to be produced from our Texas base this year because of all the freshwater,\" Graham said.\n\nWith the end of the rains and salinity levels in the bays returning to normal, late crops are coming on farther up the coast, though the size of the shrimp is very small, he said. Fortunately for shrimpers, the animals are \"highly migratory,\" Graham said.\n\n\"We hope that Louisiana has a good crop of brown shrimp, because we can go fish off Louisiana as well,\" he said. \"I've spent more time in a boat off Louisiana than I have from Texas.\"\n\nThere's also the chance for a good white shrimp harvest. White shrimp, which benefit from large amounts of freshwater, are a near-shore variety not heavily fished by the local fleet, Graham said.\n\n\"Some of the guys do it, but mainly these boats are geared up for the deepwater brown shrimp,\" he said. \"If you go up to Port Arthur, that fleet there, 90 percent of them fish white shrimp.\"\n\nEven if the brown shrimp are on the small side small this season, closing the season for two months each year has generally been successful in producing larger individual shrimp for harvest, Graham said.\n\n\"That's worked well for us for many, many years,\" he said. \"Right now with the pricing situation the way it is, there's a huge price differential between a large shrimp and a medium or small shrimp. Big ones is what we want.\"\n\nSince shrimp is an annual crop, a dismal year can potentially be followed by a record-breaker, Graham said.\n\n\"That aspect of the annual crop is so important,\" he said. \"The industry should be there as long as we can get recognition for our Texas shrimp.\"\n\nAndrea Hance, executive director of the Texas Shrimp Association, said Graham's forecast of smaller-than-normal shrimp is \"not what we want to hear.\"\n\n\"We certainly hope that the prices come up just a little bit,\" she said. \"Right now they're really low. The only shrimp that we're actually making money on are the colossal-sized shrimp, because (foreign) farms can't grow their shrimp to be that size. If we're stuck harvesting the smaller shrimp then our prices are going to be suppressed.\"\n\n\"Colossal\" isn't a precise term, but generally indicates fewer than 12 or 15 shrimp per pound, Hance said.\n\n\"We're just going to have to hope and pray we come out ahead,\" she said. \"A good year this year is if we pay back what we borrowed.\"\n\nsclark@brownsvilleherald.com"}
{"text": "On Friday, a Supreme Court of Nova Scotia judge struck down a law that allowed people who believed they were being \"cyberbullied\" to apply for legal protections. But in striking down the law, in favor of constitutional rights, the judge also returned the province to its previous void of legal protections for people experiencing online abuse.\n\nThe Cyber-safety Act was passed in the wake of the highly-publicized death of Rehtaeh Parsons with the goal of offering protection in severe cases like hers. The 17-year-old attempted suicide and later died after she was relentlessly harassed by her peers, who circulated a photo she alleged showed her being raped.\n\nBut the Cyber-safety Act's definition of \"cyberbullying\" — essentially, the repeated use of technology to cause harm to another person's well-being — has drawn criticism for being too broad.\n\nThat criticism became abundantly apparent in the case of two feuding businessmen: Robert Snell tweeted and blogged snide remarks that Giles Crouch believed were aimed at him. In one case, after the two men saw each other in the street, Snell tweeted, \"You see someone and want to clothesline them … That is normal, right?\" Crouch applied for and obtained a Cyber Protection Order against Snell under the Cyber-safety Act, but that order was voided today by Supreme Court of Nova Scotia justice Glen McDougall.\n\nRelated: Rehtaeh Parsons' Death Inspired a Cyberbullying Law in Canada — But Does It Hurt Free Speech?\n\nThe judge sided with lawyer David Fraser, who argued the act infringed on two sections of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Fraser argued the definition of \"cyberbullying\" cast a broad net and violated section 2 (b), which guarantees freedom of expression, and the judge agreed, calling the Act a \"spectacular failure\" in its breadth.\n\nFraser also pointed out to the court that legislation allowed complainants to apply for and receive a protection order without the alleged perpetrator of the harassment having any say in court. In his client's case, Snell wasn't aware Crouch had asked for such an order until a police officer served him with it, which the judge agreed violated section seven of the Charter, which guarantees the right to life, liberty and security of the person.\n\nFraser didn't ask the judge to throw out the law. Instead, he wanted the act amended, which would allow Nova Scotians to continue to apply for its protection.\n\nWhen VICE News spoke to the lawyer in August, he said it was unlikely the court would throw out the Act in its entirety.\n\nIn an interview Friday, Fraser agreed that a void currently exists in protections for harassment, but said severe cases of online harassment have protections under existing laws. In Parsons' case, for example, there were criminal harassment and child pornography charges that could have been applied, but at least initially, law enforcement failed to apply them.\n\nRelated: Canada's New Cyberbullying Law Is Targeting Teen Sexting Gone Awry\n\n\"In severe cases of online harassment, I actually don't think that there's a void. We do have existing laws under the criminal code and civil remedies that are available in those extreme cases,\" Fraser said.\n\n\"The bigger question to ask, and I think the Cyber-safety Act actually created a little bit of a diversion from that: why were the existing laws not actually applied by the police and the prosecutors at the time?\"\n\nHowever, Fraser said that any legislation that addresses that existing gap has to properly define \"cyberbullying.\" His definition would include intent to cause harm, and would take into account vulnerabilities of the complainant and their relationship to the alleged harasser.\n\nFraser added that any new \"cyberbullying\" legislation should include a proper defense, such as fair comment and the defense of truth — both valid defenses in civil defamation law.\n\n\"Do I think that there is a place for a law like a Cyber-safety Act that does provide relief for victims of cyberbullying that might not amount to criminal conduct, or that would allow you to deal with situations outside of the criminal justice system, which is a pretty blunt instrument, I do.\"\n\nFollow Hilary Beaumont on Twitter: @hilarybeaumont"}

But the hike was also due \"to improved access to previously inaccessible areas of Borno state, where the IDP population is now well over 1.6 million.\"\n\nThe IOM said the new figure covered internally displaced people (IDPs) in the northeastern states of Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Taraba and Yobe as well as the central state of Nassarawa and Abuja.\n\nIt urged the government as well as the international community to step in quickly as many were in dire need of food and shelter.\n\n\"Many IDPs, especially in host communities, have yet to receive basic items including food and shelter,\" said Enira Krdzalic, IOM Nigeria Chief of Mission.\n\n\n- Suicide bombers -\n\n\n\"It is very important for the authorities and for humanitarian partners to speed up the delivery of adequate assistance to these people,\" she added.\n\nAttacks by Boko Haram, seeking to impose a strict Islamic system in northern Nigeria, have killed at least 15,000 people since 2009, with the group's campaign also waged across Nigeria's borders.\n\nIn recent weeks suicide bombers, many of them women, have staged attacks in Nigeria, Cameroon and Chad.\n\nThe IOM said the majority of those displaced (92%) now live in host communities while the remainder live in camps or camp-like sites.\n\nBut Manzo Ezekiel, spokesman for the state-run NEMA, said the agency was already aware of the increase in IDPs and denied this was solely due to the upsurge in Boko Haram attacks.\n\n\"We are aware of the new figure of 2.1 million displaced people but it should be noted that there were other factors that brought about the increase apart from the Boko conflict,\" he said.\n\n\"We have people displaced by communal violence in states like Nassarawa and Taraba included in the figure,\" he said.\n\nEzekiel said there were also thousands of Nigerians who fled the country but were just returning home.\n\n\"For example, some 9,000 Nigerians recently came back from Cameroon and were received and camped by NEMA in Adamawa state,\" he said.\n\nHe said the agency has been meeting the needs of the displaced people.\n\n\"NEMA is on ground providing them with food, shelter and drugs,\" he said.\n\n\"Our appeal is for those affected to come to the camps so that we can attend to them. We cannot go to people's homes to give relief to them. They have to come to the camps and the collection centres to receive support,\" he said.\n\nEzekiel said only eight percent are in the camps while the majority are staying with their host communities.\n\n\"For them to be reached, they have to register with NEMA so that we will know exactly those we have to take care of,\" he added.\n\nTo fight Boko Haram an 8,700-strong Multi-National Joint Task Force, drawing in Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Cameroon and Benin, is expected to deploy soon."}
{"text": "North Korea appears to have made some progress in developing its intermediate-range Musudan missile after a series of embarrassing failures earlier this year, the Defense Ministry said after Pyongyang tested-fired two of the missiles Wednesday.\n\nThe Defense Ministry said the North fired the first Musudan — which could reach as far as Guam — from the eastern coastal city of Wonsan at around 5:57 a.m. That missile burst into pieces and fell into the sea.\n\nSouth Korea's Joint Chief Staff said that launch was assumed to be a failure, and Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani also hinted that it was unsuccessful, saying \"there seems to have been fundamental technical problems with the missile and its engine.\"\n\nBut about two hours after the first launch, at 8:03 a.m., the North lobbed a second missile from the same area that reached an altitude of over 1,000 kilometers and flew approximately 400 kilometers before falling into the Sea of Japan.\n\nNakatani said Pyongyang had shown \"some capability\" with the midrange missile, which has a potential range of 2,500 to 4,000 kilometers, and could target not only Japan, but much of Asia and the Pacific, including U.S. military bases in the region.\n\n\"This achievement means that the North now has more missiles that can reach Japan,\" Nakatani said. \"The impact of the matter poses a grave concern to Japan's national security.\"\n\nIn an email to The Japan Times, U.S. Navy Cmdr. Dave Benham, a spokesman from the military's Pacific Command, said: \"The missiles were tracked over the Sea of Japan, where initial indications are they fell.\" He added that NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command) had determined the launches did not pose a threat to North America.\n\nUntil Wednesday, North Korea had conducted four test-firings of what appeared to be Musudans since mid-April — all ending in apparent failures.\n\nJapan was quick to react to the latest salvo.\n\nIn Oita Prefecture, where he was campaigning for next month's Upper House election, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe denounced the most recent provocation, telling reporters that the act \"simply cannot be tolerated.\"\n\nDeputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Koichi Hagiuda said that Japan had lodged a stern protest with Pyongyang via its embassy in Beijing.\n\nThe U.S., which led the charge to impose some of the harshest sanctions yet at the United Nations in March, also blasted the launch.\n\n\"These provocations only serve to increase the international community's resolve to counter (North Korea's) prohibited activities, including through implementing existing U.N. Security Council sanctions,\" State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nJapan had been on alert for a launch after Nakatani ordered the Self-Defense Forces on Tuesday to prepare to intercept any ballistic missiles that flew near Japanese territory and waters.\n\nThe launch came just three days before the 66th anniversary of the eruption of the Korean War. The Korean Peninsula remains in a technical state of war because the 1950-53 conflict ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty.\n\nNakatani said Pyongyang could further intensify its saber-rattling, and that Tokyo was bracing for any further provocations.\n\nTuesday's launch underscores that Pyongyang is resolved to continue pursuing its nuclear ambitions despite the U.N. sanctions, which explicitly ban the hermit nation's use of ballistic-missile technology.\n\nAt the North Korean Worker's Party Congress in May, supreme leader Kim Jong Un was defiant, lauding his country's successful nuclear test in January and satellite launch in February.\n\nKim has been calling on the U.S. to start peace talks, but Washington argues that Pyongyang should first denuclearize before any conversation begins.\n\nMeanwhile on Wednesday, senior diplomats and experts from all countries involved in the six-party North Korean denuclearization talks attend a two-day security forum in Beijing.\n\nRepresentatives from North Korea — participating in this year's North Asia Cooperation Dialogue for the first time since 2012 — joined officials from Japan, the U.S., South Korea, China, and Russia.

The attempted hacks occurred tens of thousands of times over a period of 46 days, beginning while Vice President Mike Pence was still the governor of Indiana.\n\n\"We know that between November 1 and December 16, we were scanned with about 14,800 scans, nearly 15,000 different times,\" DHS Indiana Secretary of State Connie Lawson told The Daily Caller.\n\nLike Georgia, Indiana did not give DHS permission to scan.\n\nThomas Vessely, IT director for the Indiana secretary of state, told TheDCNF that \"we kindly declined [DHS] assistance because we were very comfortable in the work we were doing in monitoring our election system.\"\n\nSo why did DHS allegedly go for it anyway?\n\nLawson said she \"always assumed it was because I was the incoming President of the National Association of Secretaries of State and because we declined their assistance.\"\n\nGeorgia also declined \"help\" from DHS regarding its election system.

It wasn't a Russian IP address mucking around in the state's affairs, but an IP address belonging to DHS, he said.\n\nWhen Idaho \"looked at IP addresses that tried to get into our system,\" it didn't find \"a single IP address from a foreign country,\" but one from \"our own Department of Homeland Security.\"\n\nDenney also told the Post Register, \"I don't know what they [DHS] penetrated, or what they tried, I just know their IP address showed up as hitting our website. I don't know what they were doing. It would have been nice if they had told us.\"\n\nDenney expressed frustration that DHS conducted penetration tests without any warning or permission, adding that other secretaries of state across the country are also really concerned about what the election system designation of critical infrastructure will mean in the long run.\n\nA DHS spokesman said it will address Denney's concerns, but \"when DHS conducts a cybersecurity scan of a network or system, we do so only with the cooperation and consent of the system owner.\"\n\nSimilar hacking accusations by states that gave DHS permission to probe\n\nAfter Georgia accused DHS of trying to hack its computer network and voter registration database, and DHS denied it , West Virginia Secretary of State-Elect Mac Warner accused DHS of attempting to hack West Virginia election records too, just as agency had allegedly tried to hack Kentucky's\n\nKentucky later claimed the alleged DHS IP address did not access \"public voter information and online voter registration websites.\" Kentucky had granted DHS permission to conduct regular scans and concluded the \"IP address made no attempt to scan, attack, or infiltrate our system and that the visits appeared to be regular web traffic.\"\n\nWarner's claims about the West Virginia election records hack by DHS were disputed by then Secretary of State Natalie Tennant.

{"text": "Loading ... Loading ...\n\nIn another devastating blow to the 4th Amendment, on Monday, the Supreme Court ruled that evidence of an alleged crime can be used against a defendant even if police did something inappropriate or even illegal to obtain it.\n\nIn a split 5-3 decision, the justices voted to reinstate the drug-related convictions of Joseph Edward Strieff. In the case of Strieff, he was illegally detained during a \"concededly unconstitutional detention,\" which eventually led to the discovery of drugs inside his vehicle.\n\nIn Strieff's case, a trial court judge later found that the officer did not have enough evidence to initially stop and question him. But the judge ruled that Strieff's subsequent arrest on an outstanding traffic warrant justified the search — implying that the use of criminal behavior to catch criminal behavior is just.\n\nThe Utah Court of Appeals agreed with the trial court that the drug evidence was admissible at trial, but, in a moment of logic, the Utah Supreme Court last year reversed that decision.\n\nThe Utah Supreme Court noted in its January 2015 decision that the case presented \"a gap of substantial significance\" in terms of prior rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court on Fourth Amendment issues, and that other courts that have addressed the issue have come to \"substantially different conclusions\" regarding search and seizure law.\n\n\nThe Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule allows criminal defendants to suppress \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" — that is, evidence obtained as a result of a search or seizure that violates the Fourth Amendment. The reason this rule exists is due to the obvious conflict of interests in cops breaking the law to enforce the law.\n\nHowever, thanks to Monday's ruling by the Supreme Court, that is exactly what will happen now. Police have essentially been given a free pass to violate the rights of individuals — just so long as they find evidence of a 'crime.'\n\nOn Monday, the logic applied by the Utah Supreme Court in 2015, was thrown to the wayside in a handout to the police state.\n\nGiven the reality of the militarized police state rising up from the horrors of the war on drugs, the fact that cops can now legally act illegally to bust people for possessing arbitrary substances is chilling.\n\nAs if breaking the law wasn't enough, prior to this ruling, police were no longer required to even give the appearance of an understanding of the laws they're tasked with enforcing, thanks to a recent court decision surpassing even the veritable green light previously granted in Heien v. North Carolina.\n\nIn the Heien case, the Supreme Court ruled a \"police officer's reasonable mistake of law gives rise to reasonable suspicion that justifies a traffic stop under the Fourth Amendment.\" A motorist's broken tail light caused an officer to make a traffic stop — during which evidence of a separate violation of the law was discovered in the vehicle.\n\nBut in North Carolina, a broken tail light wasn't illegal, thus not sufficient cause to justify the stop — nor the arrests stemming from it, lawyers argued, because that would be a violation of unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court ruled the officer's ignorance of the law essentially didn't matter — effectively allowing police around the country the ability to make stops if they 'reasonably' believe the cause for the stop is legal. Plainly, police can stop and search you despite ignorance of the law.\n\nNow, in U.S. v Shelton Barnes et. al. — a case that seemed to slip by largely unnoticed — even that flimsy justification has been deemed too constricting of police power, and police ignorance can actually be used against you in a trial.\n\nOn Monday, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said in dissent that the decision in Utah vs. Edward Joseph Strieff, is a blow to constitutional rights.\n\n\"The court today holds that the discovery of a warrant for an unpaid parking ticket will forgive a police officer's violation of your Fourth Amendment rights,\" Sotomayor wrote.\n\nSotomayor's dissent was joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Elena Kagan.\n\nNow, police need not understand the law, or even abide by the law — to enforce the law. In what world is this considered acceptable?\n\nHelp Us Be The Change We Wish To See In The World."}
{"text": "A nature trail leads away from the campgrounds in the center of Reston, Virginia's Lake Fairfax Park. (Fritz Hahn/The Washington Post)\n\nHuman beings love being outside — an estimated 8 billion visits are made annually to natural protected areas, a number that's larger than the total world population.\n\nBut could spending time in natural scenery also have larger implications for how we behave politically, or how we treat one another?\n\nA new study suggests the answer is yes.\n\nThe paper, just out in the Journal of Environmental Psychology, is by psychologist John M. Zelenski and several other colleagues from Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada. In the study, the researchers wanted to test the idea that there's a link between actually experiencing the natural world, and behaving in a sustainable way. \"We hypothesize that participants exposed to nature will make more cooperative, and thus sustainable, choices,\" they wrote.\n\nHow do you study this idea? The research design was a series of experiments with college undergraduates, who, in the first of three studies, were asked to watch a 12 minute video. In some cases, it was a nature video — BBC's \"Planet Earth,\" no less. In others, it was a documentary about New York City's impressive — but also quintessentially urban — architecture.\n\nThen the subjects played a game that the researchers called a \"fish-themed commons dilemma.\" In the game, a group of people decide how many fish to catch over the course of a number of \"seasons.\" Players receive 10 cents per fish caught (but it costs 5 cents to travel out to sea to catch them); the ocean initially contains 50 fish; and over seasons, fish regenerate at a fixed rate.\n\nThe participants were playing against other simulated fishermen who had been programmed to \"behave relatively cooperatively,\" rather than greedily (i.e., catching too many fish to maximize their profits, but ultimately crashing the fishery).\n\nThe results showed, sure enough, that those who had watched the nature video \"harvested significantly fewer fish per season.\" And moreover, the virtual oceans in which they fished supported sustainable fishing for longer. In contrast, those who watched the architecture video harvested more fish early on, going for the money.\n\n\"By season 15, 49.09% of the architecture condition's oceans went extinct, compared to 28.57% in the Planet Earth condition,\" wrote the authors.\n\nIn several subsequent studies, meanwhile, the researchers modified the experimental conditions in order to test the strength of the results, a common practice in psychology studies. Thus, in another study, three different nature videos now showed a forest, a pack of wolves hunting, and a destructive flood. The architecture videos, meanwhile, showed an exciting Las Vegas scene and an old rundown house. Thus, people saw both pleasant and unpleasant images of nature and a built environment.\n\nEven so, the nature focused videos once again had the effect of \"producing more pro-social responses\" in the fishing game. \"These effects do not depend on nature's pleasantness,\" noted the authors.\n\nSo why does viewing nature — as opposed to something constructed by humans — seem to have this effect? The authors say they don't know the exact mechanism, though they speculate that it has something to do with \"shifting people's preferences from immediate gratification to larger but more distant payoffs.\"\n\nThe study also evokes E.O. Wilson's well-known biophilia hypothesis, which suggests that we have an evolutionary yearning to be in natural environments and among other creatures due simply to where we ultimately come from, back in deep time. The idea here, wrote the authors, is that \"we evolved in natural environments and, thus, they still support optimal human functioning.\"\n\nIf nature exposure works to change our behavior and make us more cooperative, there could be considerable implications for environmental campaigns. Thus, the authors suggest that climate change advocates might consider using nature-focused messages, rather than economic or national security framings, to advance their cause. After all, global warming is ultimately an issue of the people of the world dumping too much of their waste into the atmospheric commons, and thus far failing to cooperate adequately on strategies for reduction.\n\nThe overall results, the paper concluded, also \"suggest that societies might consider investing more in nature.\""}
{"text": "DIY gardening is on the rise in Tokyo, reflected in the city's changing landscape and on its dinner plates.\n\nTucked away in an oasis of calm in Tokyo's Setagaya ward, Yoshi's apartment is like many others in urban Japan, save for one key difference. If you crack the window in his living room you'll find a good-sized ledge with a number of pots where the 31-year-old white collar worker tends to his growing \"mini-farm\".\n\n\"This is my little garden,\" he told The Diplomat, pointing to different pots from which tomatoes and other low maintenance greens can be seen sprouting. \"I really like the idea of growing some of my own food, even if it's just a small part of what I eat.\"\n\nWhile Yoshi's crops may be modest, he is part of a global trend: an increasing number of urbanites are developing a green thumb. The movement – urban farming or DIY gardening – operates on the belief that localizing our food production is a good idea indeed.\n\nAs National Geographic points out, a number of pressing issues have put food production at the forefront, from the population explosion and environmental toll taken by agriculture to the use of energy (transportation linked with distribution) and habitat loss. As an added bonus, it makes cities greener to boot. Tokyo is no exception.\n\nWhile fruits and vegetables can be seen growing on city dwellers' balconies from Singapore to Seoul, this trend has gained momentum in disaster-prone Japan, spurred on most significantly by the nuclear meltdown in Fukushima.\n\n\"Fukushima absolutely triggered a greater interest in urban gardening,\" Justin Potts of Umari, a Tokyo-based group that organizes agricultural and business projects, told The Diplomat. \"The reason for this is understandable. People want to know where their food comes from.\"\n\nStill, panic does not enter the equation for most Tokyoites. In the popular imagination the megalopolis calls to mind Blade Runner-esque cityscapes – neon, maze-like networks of alleys, chaotic jumbles of electrical wires, and an overwhelming presence of concrete and glass. But take a closer look and you'll see many signs of organic life in Japan's capital.\n\nIn an article on the Tokyo Fruit Layers project, Tokyo-based DIY gardening evangelist Chris Berthelsen, along with Jess Mantell and Jared Braiterman, tells us not get lost in the concrete jungle. \"Look closer,\" the article reads. \"Plants come out to chew at the borders. The persistence of nature reveals Tokyo as livable and humanscaled, hands-on and delicious – a surprisingly productive fruit basket.\" Other benefits are explained here.\n\nPotts seconds this view. \"At a lot of old homes around Japan you see that many people have some great little gardens,\" he said. \"A few pots of this and that: people are looking once again at the value of growing their own food and knowing fully where it all comes from.\"\n\nAccording to the essay coauthored by Berthelsen, Mantell and Braiterman, Tokyo imports more than 60 percent of its food, \"but informal local edibles maintain a vital force in city life.\" This includes more popular types of produce in Japan – peaches, pears, blueberries, persimmons, yuzu – as well as more exotic varieties, from bayberries to mountain cherries.\n\n\"Tokyo's informal urban agriculture transcends functionality, utility and technique,\" the artist suggests. \"Its landscape is more humane than that. This city has vast potential for being a center of fruit production, and understanding its fruit layers can help make urban life more social, resilient and delicious.\"\n\nThere remains one question: can urbanites who have never stepped foot in a field truly take on the role of farmer?\n\nPotts makes an important point. \"You can't live on a few tomatoes on the porch,\" he said. \"But bringing the source of the food closer to the dinner table – there are new ways of doing that. And it largely involves connecting it to a larger community.\"\n\nAs Potts suggests, the quest to tap Tokyo's full agricultural potential cannot be achieved by the city's residents alone. Outside expertise from Japan's bountiful heartland have become increasingly involved, as we will explore tomorrow."}

We are heartbroken, afraid, confused and guilty. Guilty for not being able to fix a world that feels broken, guilty for caring, guilty for not caring.\n\nYour numbness? It's normal. And it doesn't mean you don't care.\n\nChoosing to disconnect is a defense mechanism to help protect yourself, says Lindy Schultz, spokesperson for the Community Reach Center which provides supportive mental health services in Colorado. \"If you feel like can't even manage to follow it in the media, it's too much — it's a normal response to want to unplug. You can become vicariously traumatized by overloading on the media.\"\n\nYour heartbreak, your fear? That's normal, too — even if you've never been to the location of the attack or don't personally know anyone who was there.\n\nJust by reading about these tragedies and learning about the lives lost and those forever scarred, you might experience a trauma reaction, the University of Norte Dame's Counseling Department states on its website.\n\n\"It is difficult to predict what type of trauma reactions you will experience following a disastrous event,\" the department states. \"It is important to allow yourself permission to have your reactions, and take care of them both by yourself and by asking for help from others, as best you can.\"\n\nDaniel Antonius, who has studied terrorism and how it affects us, says news coverage and social media play a role in our mental exhaustion when it comes to tragedy.\n\nSeeking information during times of tragedy is normal and \"can be used to restore some sense of normality in people's life,\" says Antonius, director of the psychiatry department at the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at the University at Buffalo. But, that has a significant downside \"in which people live and relive the attacks when they watch or read stories about them,\" Antonius says. \"This overexposure can cause increased fear, anxiety and helplessness.\"\n\nIf you are having trouble, here are some things the University of Rochester's Counseling Center recommends:\n\nReach out to your friends and family and other support systems.\n\nDo something for someone else.\n\nGo to a quiet place. Noise and chaos might contribute to your state of mind.\n\nTake a long hot bath or shower.\n\nGet a good night's sleep.

{"text": "Since 1990, the fraction of Americans with no religious affiliation has nearly tripled, from about 8 percent to 22 percent. Over the next 20 years, this trend will accelerate: by 2020, there will be more of these \"Nones\" than Catholics, and by 2035, they will outnumber Protestants.\n\nThe following figure shows changes since 1972 and these predictions, based on data from the General Social Survey (GSS):\n\nCredit: Allen Downey\n\nThe GSS, which surveys 1,000–2,000 adults in the U.S. per year, includes questions related to religious beliefs and attitudes. Regarding religious affiliation, it asks \"What is your religious preference: is it Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, some other religion, or no religion?\"\n\nIn the figure, the dark lines show the fraction of respondents in each group for each year of the survey until 2016. The shaded areas show predictions, based on a statistical model of the relationship between year of birth, age, and religion.\n\nReligious beliefs are primarily determined by the environment people grow up in, including their family life and wider social influences. Although some people change religious affiliation later in life, most do not, so changes in the population are largely due to generational replacement.\n\nWe can get a better view of generational changes if we group people by their year of birth, which captures information about the environment they grew up in, including the probability that they were raised in a religious tradition and their likely exposure to people of other religions. The following figure shows the share of people in each religious group, for birth years from 1880 to 1995:\n\nCredit: Allen Downey\n\nAmong people born before 1940, a large majority are Protestant, only 20–25 percent are Catholic, and very few are Nones or Others. But these numbers have changed rapidly in the last few generations: among people born since 1980, there are more Nones than Catholics, and among the youngest adults, there may already be more Nones than Protestants.\n\nHowever, this view of the data does not show the effect of age. If religious affiliation increases or decreases, on average, as people get older, this figure could be misleading.\n\nFortunately, with observations over more than 40 years, the design of the GSS makes it possible to build a statistical model that estimates the effects of birth year and age separately. Then we can use the model to generate predictions, by simulating the results of future surveys. The details of this methodology are in a longer version of this article (see links below).\n\nAre these predictions credible?\n\nSocial changes are generally unpredictable. At any point another \"Great Awakening\" could reverse these trends. But among social changes, demographic predictions are relatively safe; the events they predict have, in some sense, already happened. The people who will turn 40 years old in 2037 are turning 20 this year, and we already have data about them. The people who will turn 20 in 2037 have been or soon will be born. So these predictions will only be wrong if current teenagers are more religious than people in their 20s, or if current children are being raised in a more religious environment. But in both cases, the opposite is more likely to be true.\n\nIn fact, there are reasons to think these predictions are conservative:\n\nSurvey results like these are subject to social desirability bias, which is the tendency of respondents to shade their answers in the direction they think is more socially acceptable. To the degree that apostasy is stigmatized, we expect these reports to underestimate the number of Nones. As the visibility of nonreligious people increases, they might be more willing to be counted; in that case, the trends would go faster than predicted. The trends for Protestants and Nones have apparent points of inflection near 1990. Predictions that include earlier data are likely to underestimate future trends. If we use only data since 1990 to generate predictions, we expect the fraction of Nones to exceed 40 percent within 20 years.\n\nA longer version of this article is available from my blog, \"Probably Overthinking It.\" It applies the same methods to predict changes in other aspects of religion: belief in God, interpretation of the Bible, and confidence in the people who run religious organizations.\n\nThe data I used and all of my code are available in this Jupyter notebook."}
{"text": "Death is part of life itself and as in the previous games, The Sims 4 features a series of different ways to die. Drowning is the only traditional way to die that has been removed since there's currently no swim pools in game, however all the other ways are still available. There's also three new ways to die originated from the new dynamic emotion system. If you're looking for different ways to kill your sims, then keep reading.\n\n1. Starvation\n\nThe basics of life are always present in The Sims, which makes it no surprise that eating is essential to keep your sims alive. Food restriction for too long will lead your sims into imminent death.\n\nHow to trigger this death: Abstain from eating for several days.\n\n2. Old Age\n\nNo one lives forever and there's nothing more full-filing than living a complete long life. In The Sims 4, players can live properly during their elderly phase but eventually their body will give up and natural death will occur.\n\nHow to trigger this death: Live a healthy life until the end of your elder days.\n\n3. Fire\n\nBeing cautious in the kitchen will mostly avoid this type of death but it can always happen, especially if your sims is not experienced enough in culinary methods. When you're caught by a fire and you're unable to extinguish it in time, your sims will be consumed by the flames.\n\nHow to trigger this death: Start a fire and let the flames get close. A good way to trigger a fire is to use a cheap oven and an inexperienced cooker.\n\n4. Electrocution\n\nAnother death path that has been featured in all Sims games is the electrocution. This is not an easy way to die, simply because the chances to get electrocuted are low. Still, your sims can suffer an accident and be shocked to death, literally.\n\nHow to trigger this death: Repair electronic objects repeatedly with a handiness inexperienced sims. Eventually, the event will generate.\n\n5. Overexertion\n\nGoing beyond your body's capabilities in The Sims 4 will activate an unexpected way to die, death by overexertion. This type of death can occur at any age from the young adult stage beyond and there's several ways to trigger it.\n\nHow to trigger this death: Push your sims to the limits with physical exercise (until you get the -40 sore uncomfortable moodlet), then WooHoo. Your sims will go over the limits and perish.\n\n6. Embarrassment\n\nDying from embarrassment sounds ridiculous but it's one of the new death possibilities in The Sims 4. To unlock this death you need to humiliate your sims in many ways. Peeing in your pants, having an awkward social encounter or having another sims invading your privacy will drive your sims insane and overly depressed, which can be lethal.\n\nHow to trigger this death: Embarrass your sims in several ways until he/she can't handle it anymore.\n\n7. Laughter\n\nAnother death generated by emotions is the laughter. It literally means that your sims can die from laughing too much. Just as the electrocution, this event has low probabilities to happen so patience is the main key.\n\nHow to trigger this death: Get your sims into the playful mood and repeat jokes and funny interactions.\n\n8. Laganaphyllis Simnovorii (Cow Plant)\n\nMature Cow Plants can devour sims causing immediate death. This type of plant is rare and hard to get, you can see how to get one here.\n\nHow to trigger this death: Try to get the Cow Plant's cake.\n\n9. Social Services\n\nEven though this is not a real death it works as such. If sims don't take proper care of their child, the social services will take them away and there will be no further contact, working as if the child died (at least to the family).\n\nHow to trigger this death: Do not feed your child for several days.\n\nHere's a full list of possible ways to kill your sims but be aware that ghosts do not exist anymore and certain deaths won't leave a grave behind.\n\nComments\n\ncomments"}
{"text": "Major events in the history of SGI and Priesthood\n\n\n1941\n\n\nDivision between Soka Kyoiku Gakkai and the priesthood surfaced because of the priesthood's obedience to the authorities' demands during the II World War to regard the Emperor as superior to the Buddha.\n\n\n1952\n\n\nAfter the war ended, the second president, Mr Toda was banned in 1952 from entering the Head Temple, because of Soka Gakkai's youth demand of an apology from a priest who cooperated with the military authorities.\n\n\nToda wrote: \"I thought I'd receive a reward for my loyalty in rebuking slander of the Law, but instead of praise, they handed me a reproof: 'You're banned from visiting the head temple!' My disciples replied in unison, 'Then we won't visit either, so there!'\" People are Sovereign\n\n\n1979\n\n\nThe priesthood banned P. Ikeda from giving guidance, demanded his resignation from presidency, and demanded absolute obedience of the organisation to the priesthood. P.Ikeda turned that setback into a victory through focusing on world wide movement and strengthening SGI.\n\n\nDespite the pressure and harassment, lay believers never stopped assisting the Head Temple, donating land, buildings and branch temples: \" …the Soka Gakkai built a total of 356 temples, of which 320 were built while I was president. Also, over the years, we conducted countless group pilgrimages to the head temple – the aggregate attendance coming to more than 70 million\".\n\n\nPeople are Sovereign\n\n\n1980-s\n\n\nMany members were questioning the conduct and the expensive life style of some priests (using members donations), Ordinary members raised their complaints about local priests excessive demands for conducting spiritual services, such as at marriages or prayers for the deceased (and which required considerable donations).\n\n\nTogether with the monopoly on issuing Gohonzon, the priesthood objected to considering lay believers as one of the Three Treasures (being: the Buddha, the Law and Samgha or the Community of Practitioners), asserting that the Treasure of Community is that of the Priests-only. Another matter of disagreement was the concept of Heritage of the Law, with the priesthood asserting that the heritage belongs only to one person (the High Priest), excluding laity.\n\n\n1990\n\n\n\"Then, in December, as 1990 was rapidly drawing to a close, the priesthood suddenly sent the Soka Gakkai with a letter of inquiry. It contained a list of the most ridiculous charges – such as the accusation that singing Beethoven's great hymn to universal human freedom, 'Ode to Joy', constitutes 'praise for non-Buddhist teachings'.\n\n\nFurthermore, the priesthood demanded a response to their charges within seven days\". People are Sovereign\n\n\nSGI request for dialogue with the priesthood was rejected by the Head Temple - assuming that lay believers will leave SGI organisation and register in temples. Members, however, submitted a petition asking for the resignation of the High Priest. Finally, the SGI was excommunicated from the Head Temple (28 November 1991), a date recognised by SGI as the day of spiritual independence of ordinary people.\n\n\n\"We must ensure that the common people are eternally free from domination by evil tyrants. The people are the base upon which all things rest, the most important factor. A power that does not rely on authorities, that is unswayed by them, is to be found in the power of humanity, of unity and of democracy. We must never allow this power to be diminished. This is the profound significance of the Buddhism of human revolution, which stimulates and nurtures this human power to the highest degree.\"\n\n\nSGI Newsletter 5821, 5826 (Dec. 2003)\n\n\n1992\n\n\nSeveral temples refused to follow the High Priest and disassociated themselves from the Head Temple (Association of Reformist Priests), giving their support to SGI. One of the basic issues between the Priesthood and the Association of Reformist Priests is the demand for the Head Temple's apology for supporting the war and for altering Nichiren's letters.\n\n\n2000\n\n\nThe Priesthood completes destruction of its Head Temple, the Shohondo building, which was donated by the Soka Gakkai.\n\n\n_________________________________________________\n\n\nBack to: Nichiren Shoshu & S G I\n\n\nHomepage"}
{"text": "Jets defensive lineman Shaun Ellis said the Jets did not realize Painter had replaced Manning on his first series — does that seem possible? — but Ellis claimed that, unlike Jets fans, they did not celebrate his departure.\n\n\"We want to beat them at their best,\" Ellis said. \"Hopefully, we can see them again this year. Good things happen to good teams. We're on the progress of being great. Good teams get chances. We have to make sure we take advantage.\"\n\nThe Jets' history has been pockmarked by crushing disappointments, but if they fail to make the playoffs, after the Colts gift-wrapped their opportunity, Coach Rex Ryan may need to carry tissues with him for the entire off-season. Left for later will be questions about what, exactly, the Jets will have proved by beating backups to get into the playoffs. For now, Ryan, just a few days after saying his Christmas list included a wish that Manning not face the Jets, played down the lucky break the Jets received.\n\nPhoto\n\n\"I feel fortunate that we were able to win the game,\" Ryan said. \"Our guys played great. We found a way to win. This football team beat 14 teams, so they earned the right to play it the way they wanted to. We were just going to line up and play, whoever was out there.\"\n\nBefore the game, Caldwell was circumspect about how long his starters would play, but Bill Polian, the Colts' president, has said that an undefeated season was never the team's goal.\n\nCaldwell said afterward that he had studied how teams had performed in recent years, trying to perfect the delicate balance between resting players and keeping a team sharp. He decided that going into the third quarter with a lead, he would begin to pull his starters. He said that he told the players of the plan during the week and then at halftime, and that he did not consider reinserting Manning after the Colts lost the lead.\n\n\"The most important thing is to make certain that we are operating on all cylinders come the playoffs,\" Caldwell said. \"The most important season is the one coming up.\"\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nManning had not been sharp before he was pulled — he went 14 of 21 for 192 yards — but the Jets had not sacked him and had hit him only once. Still, the Jets had taken a lead on a 106-yard kickoff return by Brad Smith to open the second half, the longest play in Jets history. That play meant that even though Manning led the Colts to a touchdown on his only drive of the second half, the Colts led by only 5 points when he departed. And Manning's absence meant there was little reason for Mark Sanchez to put the ball in the air.\n\nPhoto\n\nAfter Manning's departure, the Jets ran the ball 24 times and passed it only 5, an obvious indication that the Jets had no fear the Colts would score again. And there was little worry that the Jets would lose the fourth-quarter lead, particularly because their running game was able to chew up the clock against the Colts' defensive backups.\n\nFor the Jets, the Colts' decision was an extraordinary gift. If the Jets had lost, they would have been eliminated from the playoffs. Instead, Caldwell's decision to ease up will probably be second-guessed unless the Colts win the Super Bowl. The Colts have rested players in years past and have sometimes looked flat in their first playoff game. And in choosing to rest his starters with the game in doubt, Caldwell also endangered the playoff chances of a handful of A.F.C. teams that needed a Jets loss to help them.\n\nNot surprisingly, Colts fans booed loudly each time Painter took the field.\n\nBut the more immediate issue is how players like Manning will respond to the rest, and to their first loss of the season. With a tight expression on his face, Manning was clearly frustrated with the decision.\n\n\"We tried to score as many points as we could, we put Curtis Painter in a tough position,\" Manning said. \"This was our organizational philosophy that we stuck with. We still had a chance to win the game. Until any player in here is the head coach, as a player you follow orders and you follow them with all your heart.\"\n\nEven if their hearts broke a little bit Sunday."}
{"text": "From RelicWiki\n\n\nRaven\n\n\"I am Raven, airborne death!\"\n\nThe Raven is a form of ground attack aircraft armed with two Dark Lances and one Splinter Cannon. They are often used to annihilate the enemy's armour to make it easier for Raiders to move about the battlefield. Once they are done, they will continue to take down infantry until a path has been created for the main attack forces.\n\nTactics\n\nBy itself, the Raven is a decent anti-infantry vehicle and can even do moderate damage to vehicles. However, it is fragile and not as cost effective as Reaver Jetbikes against infantry. The key to the Raven is using it as a compliment in a quick moving advance. Be sure to travel with units equipped with Dark Lances, such as Ravagers or Scourges. Warp Beasts eat through armor fast too if you have them. The Raven can render enemy vehicles and structures impotent with the Short Circuit ability, and its partners can then quickly slice the target up with Dark Lances or teeth before they have a chance to strike back. This greatly increases the survivability of the powerful but fragile Dark Eldar. While Short Circuit is recharging Ravens can fulfill an anti-infantry role, using its mobility to escape when outmatched. Against other air units, Short Circuit should often be avoided. Many are weak enough that against Dark Lances they will drop too fast for Short Circuit to be worthwhile, others are fast enough to retreat until Short Circuit wears off.

{"text": "DETROIT - Detroit Red Wings coach Mike Babcock might have been exaggerating slightly when speaking about his team's record in Philadelphia.\n\n\"I don't think we've won in Philly since Christ was a kid,\" Babcock said.\n\nIt only seems like that. The Red Wings have lost eight consecutive games in Philadelphia, getting outscored 33-13, since winning there when it mattered the most - in Games 1 and 2 of the 1997 Stanley Cup finals en route to a sweep.\n\nThey'll have another chance Saturday at Wells Fargo Center (7 p.m., Fox Sports Detroit) and will turn to backup goaltender Jonas Gustavsson in an effort to snap the streak.\n\nGustavsson, who turned 30 on Friday, made 30 saves in a 1-0 overtime victory over Toronto last Saturday, his lone appearance thus far.\n\n\"It's going to be a new challenge,\" Gustavsson said. \"I put that (first win) behind me and I'm going to go out there and do my best.\n\n\"It's always good to get the games in; that's when you learn, gain experience. You try to take advantage of the practices, too.\"\n\nThe Red Wings (4-1-2) rank fourth in the NHL in goals-against average (1.66) and are the only team that hasn't allowed a power-play goal (21-for-21).\n\nJimmy Howard has been their best penalty killer but will get a break Saturday, watching in the only building he said he has never played in.\n\n\"Howie's never played there?\" Babcock said.\n\nThen he turned to Howard, who was sitting in his stall, and said, \"Howie, you're not getting to play in Philly, buddy! I didn't know that. ... Maybe that's why we never win there.\"\n\nSince their last regular season victory in Philadelphia on Jan. 25, 1997, with Mike Vernon in goal (also the starter in the Cup finals that year), the Red Wings have started four goalies in Philly - Chris Osgood (0-4), Joey MacDonald (0-2), Curtis Joseph (0-1) and Gustavsson (0-1).\n\nDetroit's all-time regular season record there is 13-38-11 (W-L-T).\n\nThe Flyers (2-3-2) historically have been a big, physical team that likes to rough it up, especially at home. Asked if they still play like that, Red Wings defenseman Jonathan Ericsson said, \"Maybe not as much, but I think they still have that mentality. That's the Philly way of playing.\"\n\nBut, he added, \"You need to have some quickness on your team. If you have big guys you usually don't get the quickness at the same time. I think they have a good mixture there but probably not as many hard-hitting big guys anymore.\"\n\nThe Flyers' blue line is banged up. Braydon Coburn and Andrew MacDonald are out four weeks with lower-body injuries and Kimmo Timonen is out until at least January with blood clots.\n\nThey're led up front by Claude Giroux, Jakub Voracek and Wayne Simmonds.\n\n\"I watched them the other night (5-3 win at Pittsburgh); I thought they played real well, real solid through the neutral zone,\" Babcock said. \"I think their power play is impressive, they got the puck back. I was really impressed with Simmonds, I thought he had a heck of a game. The (Sean) Couturier line was solid. I didn't know who (Pierre-Edouard) Bellemare, their second line center, was but he looks like a good player. They've got good depth up front. They look like a real good team. We'll have our hands full.\n\n\"We've got to get started and compete. We had a heck of a win (Thursday, 4-3 in overtime over Pittsburgh), really stuck with it and found a way to get a win.

But the football juggernaut will no longer have to file yearly tax forms that publicly disclose details like executive pay, including for commissioner Roger Goodell, who made $44 million in 2012.\n\nIn a letter dated Tuesday to team owners and members of Congress, Goodell called the decades-old tax-exempt status a \"distraction\" that has \"been mischaracterized repeatedly,\" and whose end \"will make no material difference to our business.\"\n\nbusiness business false after3th true Economy & Business Alerts Breaking news about economic and business issues. Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You're all set! See all newsletters\n\n\"The fact is that the business of the NFL has never been tax exempt,\" Goodell wrote. \"Every dollar of income generated through television rights fees, licensing agreements, sponsorships, ticket sales, and other means is earned by the 32 clubs and is taxable there.\"\n\nSince 1942, America's biggest sports empire has qualified as a 501(c)(6) non-profit, the same designation given to business leagues, trade groups and organizations like the American Medical Association. Central bodies for hockey and golf, the National Hockey League (NHL) and The PGA Tour, also file as nonprofits, because the tax code says they work to promote their industries, not as for-profit enterprises.\n\nThe NFL has defended its nonprofit status by pointing out all of its teams are for-profit entities, and the billions they make from TV contracts, tickets sales and merchandise are already taxed. Earlier this month, an NFL spokesman The Washington Post that the league office \"has always been a nonprofit because it does not engage in income-producing or profit-making activity.\" The NFL has defended its nonprofit status by pointing out all of its teams are for-profit entities, and the billions they make from TV contracts, tickets sales and merchandise are already taxed. Earlier this month, an NFL spokesman told The Washington Postthat the league office \"has always been a nonprofit because it does not engage in income-producing or profit-making activity.\"\n\nBut congressional leaders have routinely questioned whether sports leagues deserve the tax break. \"For every dollar that goes out in a case like this, that's a dollar my constituents have to pay in income taxes,\" said Maine's independent Sen. Angus King last year.\n\nThe NFL is following a similar play by Major League Baseball, which opted to forgo its tax-exempt status in 2007. The National Basketball Association (NBA) and NASCAR both file as for-profit companies.\n\nJust how much the NFL's headquarters in New York will need to start forking over in taxes remains unclear. A congressional committee Just how much the NFL's headquarters in New York will need to start forking over in taxes remains unclear. A congressional committee estimated the NFL would need to pay about $10 million in taxes, a drop in the bucket for a league where team revenues add up to nearly $10 billion a year.\n\nBut the NFL's executives will gain cover from criticism over their paychecks. The league's 2013 tax filing revealed that, besides Goodell's $44 million, six other executives drew seven-figure salaries and 298 employees made $100,000 or more.\n\nSome lawmakers on Tuesday celebrated the shift. Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), who last year called for stripping the NFL of its nonprofit status because of its refusal to force the Washington Redskins to change the club's controversial name, called it a \"victory for tax payers, and a long overdue step.\" She added, however, that dropping the tax break \"doesn't mean you can ignore the need for the NFL to abandon a racial slur as a team name.\"\n\nNot everyone was so congratulatory. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said in a statement Tuesday that the league's \"sacrifice of its tax-exempt status seems more like a PR stunt than a real gain.\""}
{"text": "OTTAWA — Conservative leadership candidate Andrew Scheer says universities should lose federal funding if they fail to protect freedom of speech on campus.\n\nA \"troubling trend\" has surfaced where small groups on campus can shut down events, prevent guest speakers from giving lecture and ban activities or clubs they disagree with, Scheer said in an interview Wednesday. \"Campuses are no longer the bastions of free speech that they once were.\"\n\nRecent examples include a pro-life group having its event cancelled at Wilfrid Laurier University; a student newspaper at McGill refusing to print pro-Israel articles; and protest surrounding University of Toronto professor Jordan Peterson for his views on gender pronouns.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who come to campus who say things that are outrageous. And I vehemently disagree with them. That I find offensive. Professors or guest speakers who say terrible things about everything from Christianity to capitalism,\" Scheer said.\n\n\"I just don't go to them. It's as simple as that. And it doesn't bother me. It doesn't keep me up at night. It doesn't make me want to go and tip a car over.\"\n\nPeterson has struck a public nerve with his refusal to adopt people's preferred gender pronouns and concerns around the effect of Bill C-16, the Liberals' gender discrimination bill, on freedom of speech.\n\nThe bill, which is currently making its way through the Senate, would add gender identity and gender orientation to the Canadian Human Rights Act, thus making it illegal to discriminate against someone on those bases.\n\nIt would also add these terms to a list, in the Criminal Code, of identifiable social groups that may motivate hate crime or \"advocating genocide.\" (The list already includes sexual orientation, sex and other characteristics — ethnicity, language, disability, etc.)\n\nCacophonous student protests have surrounded Peterson since he made comments last fall dismissing non-binary gender identities and suggesting using the wrong pronouns could suddenly become a crime. One rally resulted in an activist being charged with assault. Peterson received warnings from the university, too, and publicly wondered whether a proposal for federal grant money had been rejected because of the controversy.\n\nScheer, who opposes C-16, held up Peterson's right to articulate his point of view as an example of why more incentives are needed to counteract political correctness on campus.\n\n\"People can disagree with him. People can refute his points, and stand up for what they believe in. But what bothers me is this sense of shutting out any kind of dissent on certain issues. I believe that Canada is a mature enough country that we can have these debates,\" Scheer said.\n\nUnder Scheer's proposed policy, fostering and protecting free speech would become a criterion on public post-secondary institutions' grant applications to federal agencies such as the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, Canadian Institutes of Health Research and Canada Research Chairs.\n\nWhat bothers me is this sense of shutting out any kind of dissent on certain issues\n\nThe goal isn't to create an extra layer of bureaucracy, Scheer promised. \"I would instruct the minister to work with these bodies and come up with an easy way to test for it. I imagine in the early days it would be as simple as responding to complaints.\"\n\nIf a university had several incidents and identified a problem on campus, it could show that it was doing something about the problem, he explained, whether pressuring student unions through financial means or putting better security plans in place.\n\nStudents, and not institutions, are often the source of controversial actions on campus — but \"I do believe the university does have a responsibility to step in and prevent small rabble-rousing groups from having an impact,\" said Scheer.\n\nGroups can be loud and proud about controversial views on either end of the spectrum, as long as they don't prevent others from exercising their rights, Scheer said. \"If universities are allowing small radical groups to infringe on that, I think they have a responsibility to prevent that.\"\n\nScheer will face fellow frontrunners including Kevin O'Leary, Maxime Bernier and Kellie Leitch at a final leadership debate in Toronto next week.

{"text": "Alexander McCobin, president and co-founder of Students for Liberty, says pro-liberty students should put aside their disagreements and fight together for a free society.\n\nIn Hong Kong, some are all too willing to make hay out of any connection of inspiration to outside groups. A US-based institution that helps students abroad stand for liberty may sound suspicious to those wary of 'foreign influence', a term loaded with local political significance – and usually little substance. Worldly young Hong Kongers see things differently and are willing to take inspiration from successful, principled organisations, no matter their pedigree.\n\nBuild it, and they will come\n\nOne such source of inspiration is the Students for Liberty. Visiting Hong Kong, the founder and visiting president of Students for Liberty (SFL), Alexander McCobin, recalls the early days of the group, now arguably the largest student and libertarian organisation in the world. First established in 2008 as a volunteer body, the SFL was not ambitious to expand beyond its national border, but focused on providing supports to local student groups that share their libertarian values.\n\n\"We didn't want to go global in the beginning,\" Mr McCobin says. \"We asked other people about the idea and the general advice was not to do it. And we didn't know what we could offer to other student groups as foreigners.\"\n\nIt was the overseas groups, as it turned out, that came to seek SFL's guidance and assistance in leadership and organisational issues so they could replicate the success of the American student movement.\n\nOf the students, by the students, for the students\n\nThe result is the world's fastest growing and most influential student and alumni-led platform with about 2,300 affiliated groups. Only about 1,000 are based in the US. There are eight regional executive boards with charter members in every inhabited continent. Their annual international and regional conferences attract hundreds of thousands of participants throughout the year, expanding the libertarian community. Three weeks from now, thousands are expected to attend the 9th International Students for Liberty Conference (ISFLC16) in Washington, DC, featuring Russian feminist punk band Pussy Riot (famed for earning the ire of officials and jail time for their views and antics), North Korean defector and human rights activist Park Yeon-mi, and Prince Hans-Adams II, reigning Prince of Liechtenstein.\n\n\"Instead of going into local political and policies, we focus on providing leadership training to students,\" Mr McCobin says, \"Each individual organisation has its own view of what liberty means, and our mission is to help them achieve their goals.\"\n\nMr McCobin cites the successful story of the SFL's Brazilian branch, where local students took a leading role in sparking protests against economic stagnation and corruption in the country.\n\nTo Hong Kong student leaders: Much to learn, you still have\n\nMr McCobin explains the recipe to minimise the impact of internal conflicts among the 2,300 groups is a decentralised approach, a people-oriented 'life project' and, most importantly, a stress on mutual respect among member groups. The focus on training individuals is crucial as leadership in university groups changes rapidly as student leaders graduate. Training individual leaders enables them to more effectively promote freedom and perhaps, as alumni, contribute to SFL's continued efforts.\n\nIt's a big tent approach. \"You need a moral high ground to unite everyone within the group, and for us it is the three big principles of economic liberty, social liberty and intellectual liberty,\" Mr McCobin adds. \"There is no place in the world that has no internal fighting. Our doctrine is that we come together on the 90% we agree upon, and respect each other [on the 10% on which] we may disagree.\"\n\nHong Kong is a newcomer to the SFL family. Only a few months ago, the first Hong Kong student, Louis Lo, joined the SFL's Charter Teams programme, an initiative to build networks with students in places without a well-established SFL presence. Mr Lo recently concluded SFL Hong Kong's second seminar in Hong Kong. Outside of the normal pro-establishment, pro-democracy continuum, it is attracting students interested in options during a time of political and intellectual ferment in Hong Kong.\n\n\nWhile Hong Kong students may be famously academic, Mr McCobin is a believer in experience. \"You sometimes learn more outside of class,\" he concludes."}
{"text": "Getty Images\n\nEach school day, millions of students move in unison from classroom to classroom where they listen to 50- to 90-minute lectures. Despite there being anywhere from 20 to 300 humans in the room, there is little actual interaction. This model of education is so commonplace that we have accepted it as a given. For centuries, it has been the most economical way to \"educate\" a large number of students. Today, however, we know about the limitations of the class lecture, so why does it remain the most common format?\n\n(MORE: Should Teachers Be Allowed to Share Their Lesson Plans?)\n\nIn 1996, in a journal called the National Teaching & Learning Forum, two professors from Indiana University — Joan Middendorf and Alan Kalish — described how research on human attention and retention speaks against the value of long lectures. They cited a 1976 study that detailed the ebbs and flows of students' focus during a typical class period. Breaking the session down minute-by-minute, the study's authors determined that students needed a three- to five-minute period of settling down, which would be followed by 10 to 18 minutes of optimal focus. Then — no matter how good the teacher or how compelling the subject matter — there would come a lapse. In the vernacular, the students would \"lose it.\" Attention would eventually return, but in ever briefer packets, falling \"to three- or four-minute [spurts] towards the end of a standard lecture,\" according to the report. This study focused on college students, and of course it was done before the age of texting and tweeting; presumably, the attention spans of younger people today have become even shorter, or certainly more challenged by distractions.\n\nMiddendorf and Kalish also cited a study from 1985 which tested students on their recall of facts contained in a 20-minute presentation. While you might expect that recall of the final section of the presentation would be greatest— the part heard most recently — in fact the result was strikingly opposite. Students remembered far more of what they'd heard at the very beginning of the lecture. By the 15-minute mark, they'd mostly zoned out. Yet these findings — which were quite dramatic, consistent and conclusive, and have never yet been refuted — went largely unapplied in the real world.\n\n(MORE: Why Grit Is More Important Than Grades)\n\nEven Mittendorf and Kalish themselves did not take these findings to their natural conclusions. Having established that students' attention maxed out at around 10 or 15 minutes, they did not question whether hour-long lectures should be the dominant use of class time. Instead, they recommended that teachers insert \"change-ups\" at various points in their lectures, \"to restart the attention clock.\" This may have been a pragmatic incremental step, but if attention lasted 10 or 15 minutes while passively listening, it is questionable why valuable time in classrooms with teachers and peers should be devoted to lecture at all.\n\nWith the Internet, lectures can in fact be divided up into shorter, sub-15 minute sessions, and be delivered outside the classroom. So what do we do with that class time? Here we can take inspiration from the humanities seminar, where any \"information delivery\" happens outside the classroom through student reading, allowing class time to be entirely devoted to teacher-moderated discussion. This also happens in many business schools, where students read a case study ahead of time and the teacher leads a conversation about the issues facing the company or executive described in the case. With engineering or science, class time can be used for students to collaboratively tackle more challenging questions or projects. The main point is that when humans get together to learn, we should replace passivity with interactivity.\n\n(MORE: Won't Back Down: Why This Education Movie Matters)\n\nWhen we free ourselves from the notion of one person delivering information at the front of a classroom at a set pace, it allows us to completely rethink our assumptions of what a classroom or school can be. We could then consider having multiple teachers in the same room working with students of multiple skill levels and age groups. A bell would no longer need to be rung to artificially stop one subject and to start the next. Ironically, by removing lecture from class time, we can make classrooms more engaging and human.\n\nMORE: How to Get — And Keep — Someone's Attention"}

{"text": "I made a desperate attempt to finish this gorgeous project over Thanksgiving, but sadly I failed. So here I am finishing it over winter break. I didn't want to drown in this sweater (my sheep one, unfortunately, has stretched with time and someone not long ago mistook it for a dress, which is not how I intended it--not into the shapeless sweater look!!) so I figured I could sub worsted for bulky and go down two needle sizes.\n\n12/22: All the charts are FINALLY done, and I sewed in the majority of the loose ends. Finishing on projects like this is so daunting--I still have to seam the underarms and shoulders (kind of, my shoulders ended up wonky). I like set-in sleeves better, esp. for colorwork projects where you can see the floats between the raglan decreases, so I considered rewriting the pattern, but laziness and a desire to wear the sweater took over.\n\nThese amazing charts are too fabulous, but I was not wowed by the quality of the knitting instructions, especially for the price of the pattern. Will make better notes on potential mods/issues once I finish.\n\n12/23: DONE OMG IT'S BEAUTIFUL. I'm so glad I went down two needle sizes from suggested and used worsted; it fits like a glove. Just need to steam it into submission and will get pics!\n\n12/28: No project is truly done without pics, so here they are. I ended up having to reinforce the decrease line between the sleeves and body because I thought it looked sloppy. I think if I knit this again I would just do set-in sleeves. I have so much midnight heather left, I need to figure out something to do with it all.\n\nGauge: 5 st = 1 in. in pattern on US 8\n\nMeasurements of finished sweater:\n\n-length from bottom edge to beginning of armhole: 17.5\"\n\n-circumference: 35\" (17.5\" front and back after blocking, no ease)\n\n-length from bottom edge to center neck below the ribbing: 20\"\n\n-length from bottom edge to top of left and right shoulders: 24\"\n\nThe ribbing at the bottom edge is 3\" long. The neck ribbing is 1.5\" but was rather improvised, so I do not remember how many I picked up or how I decreased for it.\n\nMods:\n\n-Disregarded the initials at the bottom of the chart. Did not want.\n\n-Made the neck ribbing longer and added some decreases so that it would not be a boatneck.\n\n-Reinforced decrease line between arms and body.\n\n-Worked the right sleeve in MC stranding so that the gauge would be similar to the left.\n\n-Added three extra rounds of ribbing at hips to make sweater hang better.\n\nThings you might find weird about this pattern:\n\n-The yoke chart works, but it is very strange, because you have to follow it in a circle. I didn't find it overly difficult, but I wasn't too concerned with following it exactly.\n\n-As someone else mentioned, the raglan decreases come every row instead of every other row, which created an exaggerated gap between arms and body. Ended up having to seam around the decrease line so that it looked neat, otherwise there would've been visible floats.\n\n-The way the neckband is written lends itself to a boat neck or (worst case scenario) a floppy neck, so if you want a traditional sweater neck you may need to increase the length of the ribbing.\n\nYes, this pattern is expensive. Ordinarily I wouldn't pay so much for a pattern, particularly an imperfect one, but it's incredibly beautiful. The chart is a work of art. I prefer to look at it as, \"Could I ever buy a sweater like this, that fits me so well, for less than $50 total cost to me?\" (what I paid total for materials + pattern in this case, not counting labor hours, since it's for me and I would've spent those hours watching TV anyway). I highly doubt it, plus it's satisfying to be able to say I made it!\n\nFailed IntSweMoDo #4."}
{"text": "Questions of why creators create, how they structure their days, and where they look for inspiration hold a strange kind of mesmerism over us mere mortals, an elusive promise of somehow reverse-engineering and absorbing genius through voyeurism. In 2003, artist Joe Fig began interviewing famous painters about how, where, and why they do what they do. The result was Inside the Painter's Studio (UK; public library) — an anthology of 24 conversations with some of today's most revered contemporary artists. Among them was legendary photorealist Chuck Close, who despite his paralyzing 1988 spinal artery collapse remains one of the most prolific, disciplined, and sought-after artists working today.\n\nIn the interview, Close echoes Tchaikovsky and Jack White in the supremacy of work ethic over \"inspiration\":\n\nI was never one of those people who had to have a perfect situation to paint in. I can make art anywhere, anytime — it doesn't matter. I mean, I know so many artists for whom having the perfect space is somehow essential. They spend years designing, building, outfitting the perfect space, and then when it is just about time to get to work they'll sell that place and build another one. It seems more often than not a way to keep from having to work. But I could paint anywhere. I made big paintings in the tiniest bedrooms, garages, you name it. you know, once I have my back to the room, I could be anywhere.\n\nWhen asked about the motto or creed by which he lives, Close puts it even more forcefully, negating the notion of creative block:\n\nInspiration is for amateurs — the rest of us just show up and get to work. And the belief that things will grow out of the activity itself and that you will — through work — bump into other possibilities and kick open other doors that you would never have dreamt of if you were just sitting around looking for a great 'art idea.' And the belief that process, in a sense, is liberating and that you don't have to reinvent the wheel every day. Today, you know what you'll do, you could be doing what you were doing yesterday, and tomorrow you are gonna do what you did today, and at least for a certain period of time you can just work. If you hang in there, you will get somewhere. […] I never had painter's block in my whole life.\n\nIndeed, like many famous creators, Close enacts this belief in his own daily routine:\n\nOn a typical country day I am painting by nine, and I usually work until noon. Three hours in the morning. I will have lunch either at my desk, or if it's nice I will go to the pool. Of if it's really nice I will go to the beach for an hour. Have lunch on the beach perhaps, and then I come back and I paint from one to four, another three hours, and about then the light is failing, and I am beginning to fuck up. So then my nurse usually comes at four, and I stop working, clean up, have a big drink, and that's a typical day. I work every day out there, every single day.\n\nClose closes by offering emerging artists some words of advice on creative autonomy:\n\nI think while appropriation has produced some interesting work … for me, the most interesting thing is to back yourself into your own corner where no one else's answers will fit. You will somehow have to come up with your own personal solutions to this problem that you have set for yourself because no one else's answers are applicable. […] See, I think our whole society is much too problem-solving oriented. It is far more interesting to [participate in] 'problem creation' … You know, ask yourself an interesting enough question and your attempt to find a tailor-made solution to that question will push you to a place where, pretty soon, you'll find yourself all by your lonesome — which I think is a more interesting place to be.\n\nThen again, there's always the question of whether it's at all possible — or desirable — to fully purge ourselves of influences, given everything we create is an amalgamation of our lived experience, our \"personal micro-culture,\" without which we'd be unable to come up with \"new,\" combinatorial ideas.\n\nImages courtesy Princeton Architectural Press / Joe Fig"}
{"text": "Warning: This story contains major spoilers from the season finale of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Read at your own risk.\n\nIt wouldn't be an Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. season finale without a shocking twist.\n\nJust when things were settling down after the Inhumans vs. S.H.I.E.L.D. battle, Fitz (Iain de Caestecker) and Simmons (Elizabeth Henstridge) finally addressed their feelings for one another and decided to go on a date to test the waters. Naturally, things go awry after Fitz accidentally unlocks the crate housing the Kree stone—the same stone that the Inhumans said was lethal to their kind in the wrong hands. Turning into liquid form, the stone absorbs Simmons before reforming as if nothing ever happened.\n\nFear not, Henstridge is signed on to return for season 3, so Simmons has not met a grim fate. \"Usually if it's something really bad, you get a call,\" the actress tells EW on the set of the ABC super series.\n\nBut, really, what the heck just happened to Simmons? \"Part of me was thinking, if this is some sort of Inhuman thing then maybe this is like the mist, and it's some sort of gel, and maybe I'll have superpowers, but I don't think I will,\" Henstridge says. \"I think I'm somewhere. I think it transports me somewhere. We've had so many theories on set. 'Maybe she can go back in time and kill Ward,' or 'Maybe she goes back in time and for whatever reason Fitz doesn't know who she is and no one knows who she is,' or 'Maybe she goes invisible and no one can see her,' or 'What if she's just trapped inside the rock?' That would be terrible. There have been so many theories, but I think it's a transportation device.\"\n\nHenstridge, however, at least appreciated that Fitz and Simmons got to have a long overdue discussion about their feelings for each other before her disappearing act. \"Having had that conversation, in her mind, whatever happens to her, she's thinking, 'Well, I know Fitz is going to come and get me because he's my boyfriend now,'\" she says with a laugh.\n\nOn the plus side, this happened to a \"more accomplished\" and field-ready Simmons, versus the green agent we met in the pilot. \"Her main asset is still her mind,\" Henstridge says. \"She's had basic combat training, but she's by no means a fighter. I do think she's much better at manipulating, lying a little bit or being cleaver in that way, so I do feel much more confident that wherever she is, she's better equipped—maybe not as well equipped as she can be.\"\n\nUltimately, Henstridge says she wasn't worried about Simmons' fate, just feeling fortunate to have been along for the ride. \"Honestly, I'm pinching myself that I'm still in it,\" she says. \"We've done 44 episodes now and I've been in every single one. It's such a joy to be here. As an actor, you get it—you get that at any point, for the good of the show, you might be killed off or out for a few episodes. At this point, the show is bigger than me or anyone in it. I was more excited about it. I definitely thought, 'Well, I'll wait for a call or not.' It's a strange feeling at this point. We've done two seasons. I never want it to end, but if it ended, I feel like I've really gotten to know this character. If this was the start of the first season, I'd probably be hyperventilating, but I have a strange zen about the whole thing. It's probably because I read it.\" Henstridge then pauses before reassuring herself as much as the fans, adding, \"They would've called me.\"\n\nMarvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. will return to ABC this fall.

{"text": "If you're an ecommerce business or selling any sort of products to consumers, you've likely come across product recommendation systems. Anyone making a purchase from bigger online brands like Amazon or NetFlix has likely been recommended books to buy or videos to watch. Indeed, many marketers and sales consultants have written about the effectiveness of product recommenders increasing sales.\n\nWhat do product recommenders do?\n\nThe problem solved by product recommenders is simple to state but difficult to do: take all your customers' past behaviors and find which products they are likely to buy next. Such recommendations solve two problems:\n\nDetermine the next product to buy. Most companies have too many products for customers to easily manage and browse. Giving them a ranked list, optimized for their tastes, will make it easier for them to buy something new. Lead lists for outbound campaigns. Similarly, if you are a company with a large number of customers, choosing which to contact or e-mail can be a costly decision. Product recommenders let you rank which customers are likely to buy a certain product, so you can target your sales efforts more effectively.\n\nOne of the most well-known forms of product recommendation is called \"collaborative filtering\". In one form of this filtering, customer purchase histories are compared to each other. Those with similar purchases are then grouped together and products that the group likes, but which a certain individual in the group has yet to buy, will be recommended.\n\nAs an example, suppose you are someone who has previously watched all Star Wars and Indiana Jones movies, but nothing else. A collaborative filter could see that others who have similar patterns have also watched the lesser-known \"American Graffiti\", and this would then be recommended to you.\n\nBest-in-class recommendation engines\n\nMost product recommenders, particularly for smaller companies, suffer from what is known as the \"cold start\" problem. If you have too few recommendations or if a customer has never made a purchase, how do you know what to recommend? More importantly, once they start buying, how do you make the recommendation as accurate as possible?\n\nAt Canopy Labs, we approach the problem through \"cross-domain\" recommendations. Rather than taking past purchases by themselves, we look at all aspects of a customer's behavior to better understand what they are like and make recommendations. Here is the data we take into account:\n\nEmail activity. Imagine that every email communication you send your customers were also a product. Those who open e-mails and click links are implicitly showing their preferences for content and offers. We use this to group people in a similar way we group through purchases.\n\nImagine that every email communication you send your customers were also a product.

Finally, we take into account the actual purchases customers have made, just like most other recommendation systems.\n\nDepending on industry and size of the company, the way you take into account the information above differs. For example, North American fashion retailers tend to benefit from past purchases and email activity — possibly because fashion trends are somewhat similar across North America. On the other hand, local commerce sites (e.g., daily deals websites, discount sites, etc.) often require demographic information to be taken into account for their product recommenders. This is likely because many of their products are location-specific and not available in all regions.\n\nFind out more about how to personalize your emails."}

We have all, publicly or privately, spoken about our desire to be a force of positive change at VICE, a company which we believe has both a torrid history and a great deal of journalistic excellence. In light of the Daily Beast's story, we have realized how important it is that we not only push for change in private, internal meetings, but that we also must use our platform to publicly hold accountable our own workplace.\n\nIn addition, Vice's editorial union posted a statement on Twitter:\n\nVice Union statement on workplace sexual harassment: pic.twitter.com/YbGlZSuQgJ — VICE Union (@viceunion) November 15, 2017\n\nIt doesn't take a tea-leaf reader to see that these, along with a very odd (and previously unbylined, now attributed to Oliver \"Oli\" Coleman) Page Six item lightly threatening Shane Smith, plus a lot of rumors I have personally been hearing for WEEKS, portend a big story is on the way, almost certainly in the New York Times, detailing a larger investigation into the company's less than stellar record in the workplace sexual harassment department. \"Given the current wave of sexual harassment scandals,\" Coleman maybe warns, \"Vice mogul Shane Smith may regret a 2003 interview in which he brags about having sex and orgies with models he hired for shoots for his magazine.\" The whole piece is reminding everyone that Vice already aired its dirty laundry in a 2003 book that already detailed all the coke orgies, and a Vice spokesperson said something to the effect of, we definitely didn't preëmptively (let me have it) plant this item in a rag owned by Rupert Murdoch, who owns a 5% stake in our company.\n\nVice Media may be getting the full Times treatment as early as today—earlier this week, Vice News had an all-hands meeting led by Josh Tyrangiel, and this morning, the editorial leadership had a meeting as well to come up with a joint statement to be published to the sites this afternoon. A company-wide State of The Union meeting is scheduled for this morning at 11am.\n\nThe run-up to the release of this story is bigger than any other in the mediasphere to date, if surely the least shocking. Vice insiders describe the company as a place with a lot of \"Company Men (and women)\" with a culture of protecting friends of Shane Smith (reminds me of Fusion's \"F.O.I.L\"—Friends Of Isaac Lee). What happens when you throw a bunch of older punk rock bros together with a bunch of poorly paid content producers who are only there in the first place for the advertising the site would draw? I'll leave that to the New York Times, but suffice it to say that there's a reason Shane Smith is a billionaire, and it's not the editorial arm of Vice. When you have money like that, you can often shove your badly behaved dirt a little deeper under the rug rather than causing a big scene by letting it go. After all, what's a few extra aging hardcore dudes and foulmouthed editors on the payroll when you've got that sweet Unilever cash rolling in?\n\nUPDATE: Sounds like that meeting went great!\n\nAccording to several attendees of the State of Vice's Union, staffers were shown a…video? Documentary? Produced media document? A video, of some kind, at a length of greater than thirty minutes, intended to address employee questions. Employees from around the company were sat across from co-founder Suroosh Alvi, to tell them \"very anodyne things they liked and disliked\" about the company, according to one viewer. Vice CFO Sarah Broderick came onscreen assured the staff that gender pay discrimination is a problem nationwide, not just at Vice, which, thank you, Sarah!

{"text": "The Canadian Press\n\n\nOTTAWA -- For the first time, the Supreme Court of Canada has recognized a First Nation's title to a specific tract of land -- a historic decision with major implications for contentious energy projects such as the Northern Gateway pipeline.\n\nThursday's 8-0 decision, which overturned an appeal court ruling, will essentially make it easier for First Nations to establish title over lands that were regularly used for hunting, fishing and other activities.\n\nThe landmark ruling is the Supreme Court's first on aboriginal title and will apply wherever there are unresolved land claims.\n\n\"The claimant group bears the onus of establishing aboriginal title,\" Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin wrote in the decision.\n\n\"The task is to identify how pre-sovereignty rights and interests can properly find expression in modern common law terms.\"\n\nTitle, however, is not absolute, the top court declared; economic development can still go ahead on land where title is established as long as one of two conditions is met.\n\nEconomic development on land where title is established would require the consent of the First Nation. Failing that, the government would have to make the case that development is pressing and substantial and meet its fiduciary duty to the aboriginal group.\n\nIn other words, the decision places a greater burden on governments to justify economic development on aboriginal land.\n\nThe court also makes it clear that provincial law still applies to land over which aboriginal title has been declared, subject to constitutional limits.\n\nChief Roger William of Xeni Gwet'in, one of six bands that make up the Tsilhqot'in First Nation, said he welcomed the Supreme Court's decision to grant a recognition of aboriginal title to 1,750 square kilometres of territory.\n\n\"First Nations across this country have taken legal action, entered into treaty, practised their language and demonstrated use of the land and through this they have supported us -- we thank you,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe case dates back to the early 1990s, when the Tsilhqot'in First Nation first began using the courts and a blockade to stop logging operations in the area, setting off a two-decade legal odyssey that has cost tens of millions of dollars.\n\nThe Tsilhqot'in, whose territory is near Williams Lake, B.C., is made up of six aboriginal bands that together include about 3,000 people.\n\nOne of those bands, the Xeni Gwet'in, claimed aboriginal title over two areas it considered its traditional land. A forestry company attempted to secure access to those areas beginning in 1980s, eventually setting off the current court case.\n\nIn May of 1992, the Tsilhqot'in staged a blockade to prevent work on a bridge related to proposed forestry activity, which ended when then-premier Mike Harcourt promised there would be no further logging in the area without the consent of the Xeni Gwet'in.\n\nMuch of the area in dispute was turned into a provincial park in 1994, but the band and the province have been fighting over the remaining land ever since. The area at the centre of the court case represents about five per cent of what Tsilhqot'in band considers its traditional territory.\n\nThe trial, which began in November 2002 and continued for nearly five years, heard evidence that the Tsilhqot'in have been present in the area for more than 250 years.\n\nBut the trial also heard the Tsilhqot'in were \"semi-nomadic,\" with few permanent encampments, even though they saw the area as their own and protected it from outsiders.\n\nJody Wilson-Raybould, British Columbia regional chief for the Assembly of First Nations, called Thursday's decision a \"game changer.\" Unlike other provinces, British Columbia does not have modern-day treaties with its First Nations, so the ruling has significant implications.\n\n\"The court has clearly sent a message that the Crown must take aboriginal title seriously and reconcile with First Nations honourably,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\"The decision is an opportunity to truly settle, once and for all, the land question in B.C. -- where our nations are not simply making claims to the Crown under an outdated federal policy but where there must be true reconciliation based on recognition and where the outcome of negotiations is certain.\""}
{"text": "In my last post, I wrote two short stories about two goals that I had in the past that resulted in different outcomes.\n\nThe first was on my failure to make the California state track & field meet in high school, and the second was on how I accomplished my goal of getting at least 3-4 top-tier conference papers in grad school.\n\nI should be happy with reaching the second goal. However, in retrospect, I don't feel very good about it. In fact, I mentally beat myself up about it sometimes.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause I failed myself in the process of achieving the goal.\n\nHere is how.\n\nTwo problems with goals.\n\nGoals can be highly motivational, but they can also have unintended negative consequences. Here are two that I experienced.\n\nFirst, the goal may shift your priorities, and cause you to optimize for reaching the goal instead of optimizing for what you should really focus on.\n\nIn my case, the focus on paper count negatively changed my priorities. Instead of focusing on finding the big problems, I quickly learned how to spot ideas that were highly publishable. Instead of examining the problems as thoroughly as I could, I did the minimum amount of work necessary to create the data for a paper. In academia, we call these LPUs (Least Publishable Unit). I became very good at creating a LPUs around novel and publishable ideas.\n\nThis isn't good. I would have served myself better by finding big problems and tackling them as thoroughly as I could.\n\nSecond, by attaining the goal, you may actually fall short of your potential.\n\nPartway through my PhD, I transferred from the University of Colorado to Northwestern University. My expectation was that I'd graduate in 3 more years at Northwestern. I left Colorado with one top-tier paper under my belt, and hit Northwestern in full stride. In the first year there, I got two more top-tier papers.\n\nYes, that means I reached the goal!\n\nSo what did I proceed to do? I got comfortable. The next year, I published one paper, and the final year, I got a short paper into a top conference. I count all of those as 4.5 top-tier papers.\n\nI blew past the goal of 3-4 top-tier papers, but when I look back on it now, it doesn't feel good. I know I could have done way better than that if I continued to push.\n\nMy goals and their unintended outcomes.\n\nI'm not ashamed of my grad school days. I am pretty proud of the progress, and still like some of the work I did. But I know I was capable of more, and I hate knowing that.\n\nYou remember the first goal of making the California state meet? The one where I failed?\n\nThe funny thing is that I regret not making the state meet, but I don't regret anything else about it. I certainly don't feel bad about the failure. I know that I trained as hard as I could, and I feel confident that I didn't leave much at the table.\n\nIn short, my failure was a success, and my success was a failure.\n\nI've learned my lesson.\n\nThese days, I don't focus much on goals anymore.\n\nI focus on execution. I focus on learning. I focus on my craft. I focus on being good. And then being better than that. And then better.. and better..\n\nWhen I work this way, I'm always proud of myself. I don't say it in a trite \"feel-good\" sort of way. I feel genuinely proud because I am trying as hard as I can.\n\nWhat else can you ask for?\n\nOccasionally, I'll hit a milepost (which could be considered a goal). I acknowledge it, and then pat myself on the back to celebrate the progress. But then I keep moving forward because moving forward is the right thing to focus on.\n\n–\n\nP.S. This is post number #21 in a 100 day blogging challenge. See you tomorrow!\n\nFollow me on Twitter @alexshye.\n\nCheck out my current project Soulmix, your daily mix of food for the soul.

{"text": "Thursday, August 27, 2015\nWhat is it like to work at the DEA?\nDoes anyone know what it is like to work at the bench as a forensic chemist for the DEA? What kind of postings can you expect, etc?  Here's a tiny bit of helpful background: A good deal of a forensic chemist's work is instrumental analysis, says Darrell Davis, laboratory director at the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) South Central Laboratory in Dallas, Texas. Davis has been a forensic chemist for over 29 years with DEA, originally on the bench analyzing samples for the presence of controlled substances at the Southwest Laboratory in San Diego, and later managing the DEA lab in Dallas.  Davis says that the DEA's work is \"mostly analytical [chemistry], both qualitative and quantitative. \"We not only identify the controlled substance and its constituents … We also quantitate the controlled substance to let the courts and special agents know how pure the sample is. For example, we might analyze a kilogram of a cocaine-like substance and determine that 80% of that weight is pure cocaine.\"  In order to do these analyses, the chemists in Davis' lab use mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy (IR), gas chromatography (GC), and liquid chromatography (LC). \"We also use NMR [nuclear magnetic resonance] on the more complex types of samples.\" (The synthetic chemist in me wants to know - what's the other 20%?) Anyway, anyone have any experience they'd like to share? \nPosted by Chemjobber at 11:24 AM\nAs a somewhat off-topic note, it seems that the NIST meth lab explosion was on the injured security person.... http://cen.acs.org/articles/93/web/2015/08/Former-Police-Officer-NIST-Pleads.html Reply Delete\nI know that coca leaves contain alkaloids other than cocaine (benzoylecgonine, tropacaine, etc) so it's possible that other 20% is a mixture of those? I can't imagine the Columbian jungle work-up results in pure cocaine. One would have to assume they're not running massive columns? Reply Delete\nthey also used potassium permanganate to oxidize away methylecgonine cinnamate until the US authorities pushed through an embargo. It make the crystallizations little more difficult but now the coke is no longer contaminated with pro-Pakinsonian manganese impurities Delete\nThe 80% is part of the advertising. \"To be truly effective, a good narcotics agent must know and love narcotics. In fact, a good narcotics agent should have narcotics in his blood.\" \"To protect the sheep you gotta catch the wolf, and it takes a wolf to catch a wolf.\" - Alonzo Harris \"Training Day\" (2001). Delete\nA lot of cocaine is cut with all sorts of crap. Baking soda, dish detergent, salt, anything white and dry. 80% would actually be an unusually high number from what I understand. Reply Delete\nWorking for the DEA would give you a chance to say \"We got garbage.\" for samples that contain no cocaine as in the Smuggler's Blues video ( https://vimeo.com/58719183 @ 4:47). A list of impurities found in cocaine in the UK is here: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8040690.stm Reply Delete\nif I was a devious druglord, I would add a small amount of fluorescein when cutting my coke for street use. You would identify your frequent customers in a dance club just by their snouts (shining bright under the black light)... Reply Delete\nit is perfectly legal to be high as a kite unless you drive, fly or operate heavy machinery. It is illegal to possess but the moment the coke is through your snout you are not breaking law anymore, (someone just gave to you for free but you can't remember who). Delete\nA good portion of the cocaine supply these days is cut with levamisole. Anonymous above is correct though. The DEA isn't too concerned with cutting agents too much as most cutting agents are illegal. DEA only cares about illegal drugs/controlled substances, etc. You know their mantra of drugs are bad and must be made illegal at all costs. ;) Reply Delete"}
{"text": "ISIS Fires West Africa Affairs Manager But He Refuses To Leave\n\nThe Islamic State apparently is having some management troubles. ISIS has announced a new leader for its West African affiliate Boko Haram. But the man being replaced isn't going quietly.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nISIS is having some management trouble. It's having problems installing a new manager of it's West Africa affairs. ISIS claims leadership over Boko Haram, the brutal group based in Nigeria. But when ISIS accused the Boko Haram leader of being too brutal and fired him, he refused to go. Let's talk about this with NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton. She is outside Nigeria's northeastern of Maiduguri, which is the birthplace of Boko Haram.\n\nHi, Ofeibea.\n\nOFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE: Greetings, Steve. And, in fact, I'm at Muna, informal - refugees, you can call them - displaced peoples camp. And there are literally thousands of these flimsy dwellings covered in plastic and straw. They're part of the two-plus million displaced people who've been driven from their home by Boko Haram and by Boko Haram violence.\n\nINSKEEP: Goodness, that's a place certainly to discuss. What on earth is happening with Boko Haram. Would you remind people what its relationship is with ISIS? Has the Nigerian group pledged allegiance to ISIS? Is that right?\n\nQUIST-ARCTON: Indeed. About a year ago, the then-leader of Boko Haram, who goes by the name of Abubakar Shekau, pledged allegiance to al-Baghdadi, the ISIS leader. But in the last few days, ISIS is now saying that Abubakar Shekau is no longer the leader of Boko Haram. And they have appointed somebody called Abu Musab al-Barnawi. And he has recorded a diatribe saying that Shekau did not look after his fighters, let the babies of fighters die, was the - not looking after women - pregnant women while he, Shekau, was living a life of luxury with his wife.\n\nINSKEEP: So the problem here is not that he is brutal and inhumane. It's that he's accused of being brutal and inhumane to the wrong people. And so he was fired, effectively, by ISIS and replaced. But what does it mean that he's refused to go? What does that practically look like?\n\nQUIST-ARCTON: Absolutely. He was also accused of killing Muslims, and that appears to be one of the main reasons. Shekau seems to have been willing to kill anyone deemed not to be following the proper Islam. So it looks as if this move by ISIS is to put in somebody who will not be stealing the limelight and who will be following, as they see it, the tenets of Islam.\n\nINSKEEP: Are there now two factions of Boko Haram with two leaders ready to go against each other?\n\nQUIST-ARCTON: That's how it looks like, Steve. But on the ground, you get the Nigerian government that tells you Boko Haram is on the back foot now, that they have defeated Boko Haram. But here I am, Steve, just - what? - five miles from Maiduguri. And you have literally tens of thousands of women I'm seeing, and they're not able to look after their children. Their husbands aren't able to work. And they're too frightened to go back home. So despite what the government is saying, you have people who say they do not feel secure yet.\n\nINSKEEP: That's NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton.\n\nOfeibea, thanks as always.\n\nQUIST-ARCTON: Always a pleasure.

{"text": "6/16/2014 – by James Fedewa\n\n\nI moved to Pacific Beach in San Diego about 2 months before I turned 21 years old (April 1993). My initial San Diego experience was at a very impressionable time in my life.\n\n\nI only \"liked\" professional baseball and football, but the San Diego community (and local teams) only enhanced that \"like\" and grew it into a love. I quickly grew into a diehard San Diego Padres (and Chargers) fan and I have been a fanatic of those two teams for the last 22 years. Tony Gwynn was the superstar for the Padres and he became my favorite baseball player the more and more I watched and listen to him.\n\n\nLiving in San Diego, I went to as many baseball games as I could. Back in my early twenties, the Padres played at Jack Murphy Stadium, and the cheap tickets in right field were only $7 (back when baseball was considered the affordable sport), so we went to a lot of games. The best games were the Dodger/Padres of course, and Tony Gwynn always showed up and played great. Back then the Padres and Tony Gwynn were known as The Dodger Killers, as they always managed to beat their biggest rival L.A (the Giants on the other hand were quite opposite). It was Tony Gwynn's team for 20 years and San Diegans loved their perennial all-star. No matter how terrible the Padres were, San Diego always had Tony Gwynn…\n\n\nIn the 2001 season, the last season of Gwynn's career, was my most remembered of him. How he lasted on the same team his whole career made me admire him more, as he taught sacrifice. Tony did not start that season, as he had a knee injury and he was primarily used as a pinch-hitter. Most Padres fans knew it was going to be Gwynn's final season, and since he did not start that season, it made attending every game even more important (just so you can get that final glimpse of the Mr. San Diego legend). As most pinch-hitters are used, in the latter innings of close games, fans would be anxious (at a warm idle) in hope the Padres could get a runner in scoring position, then Padres fans could \"possibly\" see Tony Gwynn come in for a pinch-hit. I got to see one of those close games, might have been his last too, and Tony hit a pinch hit single, drove in the winning run and the crowd went haywire.\n\n\nI think the older we get, the more emotional we get, or we can actually recognize what we can lose even more (especially when we can relate our own experiences with those reminders of our past). The story of my favorite baseball player had so many chapters of Tony Gwynn's 20 year career, with each year (or Chapter) being so different. From a young kid and growing into the man I am today, I can feel and empathize what Tony Gwynn did then, and related it to me, and what I was doing then. Being just a fan of a guy lets me combine his career and achievements, to where I've been in my own life.\n\n\nI was always a fan of Tony Gwynn (the player, the person, the coach and the broadcaster). These \"links\" of history that we tie with the players we admire the most helps us look at ourselves (by reminding us of our own past and where we are now). I was only a fan of Tony Gwynn and I never met him, but he was Mr. San Diego and everyone in San Diego (and beyond) loved him. The moments of Tony Gwynn's career are joined and bonded together through my life, as well as other fans across the globe. Remembering what he did makes me think of where I was, when he did it. When I was 20, 30 and 40 years old, Tony Gwynn's career accomplishments remind me of several moment of my own life. When Tony Gwynn spoke, people were drawn to him. Aside his baseball accomplishments; his gift of gab, his charisma, and his smile were mesmerizing and he will truly be immortalize in my heart and with all baseball fans alike.\n\n\nTony Gwynn, Mr. San Diego, died today from cancer. He was 54 years old.\n\n\nAdvertisements"}

{"text": "Buying Reddit upvotes has always been a contentious issue where the public is EXTREMELY split:\n\nSome haven't thought about it and don't even know it's a thing. These people will purchase your products or services if they see them upvoted enough.\n\nOthers believe that Reddit's anti-spam system is unbreakable. They believe that trying to get past it can actually hurt more than it helps. These people will purchase even more of your products or services.\n\nOthers have used it to create strong, trusted and popular companies that generate profit with a very low customer acquisition cost.\n\nThe last category is represented by our clients (yep, we sell Reddit upvotes on the main page). The first two categories are people that see a comment recommending something and take it as legit without skepticism. Or they see an upvoted post reviewing a new online tool and they immediately sign up and try it. Examples can go on. In short, they make great purchasers for your products or services. Or an easy to acquire following for your cause. Or fans if you are a music artist. Etcetera.\n\nThe best marketing is word of mouth and Reddit, Hacker News and Voat are word of mouth on steroids. Reddit upvotes and downvotes can bring a lot of positive cash flow and recognition to any startup or already established business; it does it fast, in less than 24 hours. Combined with strategic comments and posts, they can ruin a competitor.\n\nYou don't have to use this strategy for direct conversions, which is what we do most. You can take it slowly and first bring a lot of Reddit traffic to your blog. Or get a lot of subscribers for your mailing list, which you'll convert later. The possibilities are really endless.\n\nThere's a reason we dislike utmost when it comes to why some people won't buy Reddit upvotes: they've been scammed before. Actually at the time when we're writing this, the first few websites that appear on Google when searching for \"buy Reddit upvotes\" are actually scams. We know because we've tried them ourselves. First off, they're slow. They won't start upvoting as soon as you place the order. They'll wait 24 hours so that moderator traffic goes off the post in cause and they can upvote it with less risk. The accounts that they use are extremely low quality and most of the upvotes won't count. They'll justify it with \"you've been downvoted as well, it's out of our control!\". Some are even so uninterested in providing a quality service that they are using software like \"Reddit Automation Bot\", \"Reddit Account Creator and Upvoater\" or \"Reddit Dominator\". With all these low quality services, your accounts will generally be banned in less than one week. If you're lucky, it can take up to ninety days. The services on Fiverr and SEOclerks related to this are even worse. Do you actually believe someone will give you 40 upvotes for five dollars? And do it manually? Just one person? No.\n\nIf it seems too good to be true, it's a scam. There's no putting it lightly when it comes to this subject: over eighty percent of the industry is a scam. Of the remaining twenty percent, most, even though they don't try to cheat you, provide a low-quality service. It's usually just one man having registered a bunch of accounts and upvoting with them through software. It's inefficient and risky. A ticking bomb waiting to be banned with everything that he's got.\n\nWe are a team of eleven persons which use Reddit ten hours per day. Most of us have been doing this for over five years. Many of the accounts that we use have received gold numerous times and have an amazing reputation in the subreddits that they're targetting. We have moderator access to over 4000 subreddits. Six of the accounts from these lists belong to us. We have the monopoly when it comes to offering a quality service, and not just on Reddit. We've helped a lot of companies become giants. We've helped politicians get elected. We're friendly. We'll keep doing this. We want to help companies succeed without huge marketing budgets.

{"text": "BY HOOK or by crook, three parties in favour of closer integration with the European Union seem set to form the next government of Moldova. With 95% of the votes counted from the November 30th election, the pro-Europeans appeared to have won about 55 seats between them in the 101-seat parliament. The parties presented themselves in lofty idealistic terms during the campaign, the pro-Brussels camp trumpeting Moldova's recent association agreement with the EU and the pro-Moscow camp its eternal love of Russia. But that is not quite the way the voters saw them. Igor Botan, a Moldovan political scientist, says that for most voters the elections represented a strategic choice between \"pro-European crooks and pro-Russian crooks\".\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\nMany citizens are questioning the election's very legitimacy, because the party they planned to vote for was blocked from participating. On November 29th Moldova's supreme court confirmed an earlier ruling that Patria, a new party led by Renato Usatii, a wealthy businessman, should be barred from the election. The court claimed that the party had been financed using illegal funds from abroad, presumably from Russia.\n\nMr Usatii's story is a window into Moldova's political snakepit. The businessman claims to have served as an adviser to Vlad Filat, a former prime minister, and to have inside knowledge of Mr Filat's corruption. Mr Filat, in turn, is widely believed to be the real power behind Iurie Leanca, the outgoing prime minister, who is widely respected. Mr Usatii positioned his new party as pro-Russian, and abruptly fled to Moscow three days before the election. His supporters say excluding his party was a nakedly political abuse of the judiciary. Even many pro-European Moldovans agree with that analysis.\n\nIn another apparent sleight of hand, a so-called \"clone party\" was created before the elections whose name and symbol were similar to the mainstream Communist Party. Dorin Chirtoaca, the mayor of Chisinau and a staunch pro-European, says he thinks the clone was created by other pro-Europeans to confuse elderly voters. It got 5% of the vote, which is less than the threshold necessary to enter parliament. If all of its votes had gone to the actual Communist Party, the pro-Europeans would have lost the election.\n\nAfter Mr Usatii was disqualified, many voters who had planned to back him instead cast their votes for a new Socialist Party. It promoted itself with pictures of its leaders meeting Vladimir Putin, and called for Moldova to enter Russia's new Eurasian customs union along with other former Soviet republics. Curiously, Moldova's Communists are far less sympathetic to Moscow; they loathe the Socialists, and say they would like to renegotiate Moldova's deal with the EU, not scrap it. This is why Russia is believed to have thrown resources and support behind the Socialists and Mr Usatii's Patria. The Communists may now back the pro-Europeans in parliament.\n\nRussia's reaction to its political setback will be critical, according to George Balan, a Moldovan official. He is charged with the rather quixotic task of attempting to reintegrate Transdniestria, a breakaway region of Moldova that has been effectively under Moscow's control since the early 1990s. Last spring, Moldovan authorities observed hundreds of young Russian men they suspected of being militia fighters entering Transdniestria, Mr Balan says. As the fighting in neighbouring Ukraine grew more intense, their numbers trailed off, but lately more are being spotted.\n\nMr Chirtoaca, whose Liberal Party is among those likely to form the new coalition, says the EU and America must now insist that Moldovan politicians crack down on corruption. But Victor Chirila, the director of the country's Foreign Policy Association, a think-tank, says the priority is to stabilise the fragile new government. One way to do so would be to seek support from the Communists. Otherwise, he says, Moldova's pro-Russian voters may feel that their pro-European fellow citizens are telling them \"you don't count and we will do what we like\". With a tenuous economy and Russia breathing down its neck, such divisions may be more than this tiny country can afford."}

{"text": "The Mennonite, known for his piercing eyes, produced herbal remedies on the side using a healing process that has \"strong Germanic roots and comes to us through Pennsylvania,\" said Rickert-Hall, who is writing a book about him.\n\nSome of Eby's healing practices, however, did scare people. They used occult books and contained charms and incantations.\n\nEby, the grandson of Bishop Benjamin Eby, one of Kitchener's first settlers, and nephew of Joseph Schneider, was feared by many.\n\nOne popular legend is that a group of boys found their way onto Eby's orchard and tried to help themselves to some apples.\n\nEby spotted them, and as the legend goes, he stared them down, paralyzing the boys with fear.\n\n\"It's one of those things where you question if he had the ability to paralyze with his eyes or if it was the fear these boys had,\" said Rickert-Hall, who is currently working on a book about the life and times of Eby, called Waterloo You Never Knew: Life On The Margins, expected to be published in the fall of 2018. \"But people were very wary of him.\"\n\nBut his legend wasn't just about his piercing eyes. \"He had a more tender side and helped a lot of people,\" said Rickert-Hall.\n\nAnna Mitchell-Hedges\n\nThe story of Anna Mitchell-Hedges and the crystal skull is one of the more recent legends in Waterloo Region.\n\nAnna's father, Frederick, was an archeologist in Belize. Accompanying her father to a dig in Belize, Mitchell-Hedges found and kept a crystal skull she discovered. Once she returned to Kitchener, she started showing it to family and friends and soon discovered the skull had healing powers.\n\nThe skull was on display at Frederick Street Mall in the 1990s, drawing big crowds before Mitchell-Hedges moved to England.\n\n\"There's a lot of folklore around the skull,\" said Rickert-Hall.\n\n\"The mall was packed and people came out to see it. It was really something to behold. To me personally, it just looked like a glass skull,\" said Rickert-Hall. \"Even in folklore, stories take on a life of their own. The reputation of this skull was so powerful that so many people came out to see it.\"\n\nHaunted buildings\n\nWhile most stories are based around a specific person, there are legends about buildings, particularly the older ones, in the region.\n\nFor example, Kitchener Collegiate Institute, which opened in 1855 as the Berlin grammar school, is known for ghostly sightings.\n\nThe sightings, Rickert-Hall said, crop up usually as construction projects are being completed. Every new extension brought out a new ghost sighting.\n\nIn Cambridge, at Galt Collegiate Institute (GCI), it is said that soldiers who graduated and died in service in the First World War returned to the school to haunt it. Founded in 1852, GCI is one of the oldest operational high schools in Canada.\n\n\"Some former students have said that at different times, in a hallway, people can be alone and they'll hear voices down the hallway. Or there will be a flash of light and they'll see movement out of the corner of their eyes,\" said Rickert-Hall.\n\nOverall, Rickert-Hall said, people are often entranced by grisly stories, such as the missing body of Reginald White, but they also like the mystery of someone like Christian Eby. While there is a certain amount of interest at historical talks that she gives around the region and beyond, Rickert-Hall says there is so much more to discover about the past in Waterloo Region.\n\n\"Our own history is understudied and unfamiliar to the people that live here,\" said Rickert-Hall.\n\nAs for whether or not she believes in the supernatural, Rickert-Hall said she always keeps an open mind.\n\n\"I'm a skeptical believer but I have an open mind. I know there's a lot of fakery, but I also believe there are a lot of things we can't explain,\" she said. \"As any kind of a researcher, if you enter into anything with a closed mind, how can you possibly find something new?\""}
{"text": "The everyday chemicals that humans ingest to relieve pain, fight depression and diabetes, or treat infection are winding up in the tissue of fish in Washington's Puget Sound.\n\nA study in the journal Environmental Pollution detected unusually high levels of drugs like Advil, Benadryl, Prozac, and even birth control pills, in the tissue of salmon.\n\nThe culprit, according to the study, is human waste.\n\n\"About 45 of the 150 chemicals we examined were found in the fish,\" said James Meador, the lead author of the study and an aquatic toxicologist working with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \"Some of them were at high concentrations. That's the kind of information that raises eyebrows.\"\n\nOver 4,000 pharmaceuticals are currently in use or in development in the United States. Many of them are finding their way into rivers, streams, and lakes, raising concerns about how exposure could impact wildlife, or even humans who consume fish.\n\nRelated: The Amount of Plastic in the Ocean Could Outweigh Fish by 2050\n\nMeador's team focused on compounds that Americans pick up at their local pharmacy, or is frequently proscribed by doctors. Water samples from the sound, wastewater, and fish tissue were analyzed for the presence of 150 different types of chemicals.\n\nOne hundred and six wastewater treatment plants, discharging as much as 97,000 pounds of chemicals each year, are located around Puget Sound. Meador's team examined only two of them, but found ingredients from 81 drugs and personal-care products, at some of the highest concentrations in the country.\n\nHundreds of chemicals can be found in the waters of Puget Sound, but only a handful are regularly monitored by wastewater facilities, which require permits from Washington's Department of Ecology to operate. Chemical levels from pesticides, for example, must remain below a certain threshold before the water can be dumped into the sound. But pharmaceuticals, now ubiquitous in society, aren't monitored.\n\n\"There's a lot of chemicals that we already know cause problems for the salmon,\" said Amelia Apfel, who works with Puget Soundkeeper. \"It's concerning to learn that they are more things in the water that we don't even know about.\"\n\nWhile the presence of toxins sounds alarm bells for advocates like Apfel, more research is needed to understand the impact of chemicals on aquatic life, said Meador.\n\nFor example, metformin, a common diabetes medication, could hinder metabolic function, impacting a fish's growth. High exposure to antibiotics could result in antibiotic resistant bacteria, which could potentially lead to dangerous pathogens that could be passed along to people. Prozac or Zoloft, which might free a person from the grip of chronic depression, could very well negatively impact the behavior of fish.\n\n\"If that happens, the fish is toast.\" said Meador. \"It doesn't last long. Predators hunt fish that stray from normal behavior.\"\n\nRelated: Your Birth Control Pills and Hamburgers Might Be Making These Fish Intersex\n\nChinook salmon migrate from the ocean to river headwaters in order to spawn. Meador and his team studied the fish because they spend several weeks each year swimming in areas of high chemical concentration. In previous studies, Meador found that the salmon that migrate through chemical-laden wastewater die at nearly twice the rate of fish in cleaner waters. Staghorn sculpin, which are abundant in Puget Sound, were also tested.\n\nThe researchers found that salmon had higher rates of toxicity than sculpin, which was surprising because sculpin are bottom-feeding fish that spend more time in the region.\n\n\"But young salmon eat a lot,\" said Meador. \"They pass a lot of water over their gills, which allows the chemicals to be taken up into the gut of the fish.\"\n\nIt remains a challenge to figure out how to remove chemicals from waterways because the regulatory agencies aren't obligated to treat them like other pollutants. Meador hopes that by studying the impacts that everyday, household pharmaceuticals have on aquatic life, scientists will be better able to define a threshold for allowable levels of chemicals in the water.\n\n\"Several species of salmon are endangered,\" said Meador. \"In the past we've looked at PCP and DDT. Pharmaceuticals are the next frontier.\"\n\nFollow Elaisha Stokes on Twitter: @ElaishaStokes"}
{"text": "Australia's smallest state looks to electric vehicle future\n\nTasmania is the only state in Australia that can claim electric vehicles (EV) there to be truly zero emission, due to the island state's combination of hydro, solar and wind-generated electricity.\n\nAnd now the state is looking to capitalise on its green-energy generation by investing in green transportation – namely EVs – at a government fleet level and with fiscal incentives. It's all part of the apple isle's new renewable energy strategy.\n\nTasmania's energy vision is vastly different to that of the rest of the Australia, which relies almost exclusively on coal and other fossil fuels to generate electricity, placing Tassie in a unique position.\n\nDubbed 'Tasmania's Energy Strategy, Restoring Tasmania's Energy Advantage', the recently released white paper proposes to turn the state into a leading renewable energy hub, and part of the island's transformation is expected to be a major shift in transportation infrastructure.\n\nAs well as seeding EVs in government fleets, the white paper suggests providing incentives for private buyers to adopt EVs – a move that has been resisted at state and federal levels across Australia.\n\nElectric vehicle take-up rates have been rapid in countries where governments provide tax breaks or other inducements, which is the case in many US states, European countries and China, and this has in turn stimulated the rollout of vehicle battery fast-charge stations.\n\nMeanwhile Australians have no incentive to adopt electric cars, and the sales results reflect that.\n\nThe Holden Volt electric car is no longer sold in Australia, partly due to a lack of demand, while vehicles such as the BMW i3 and Nissan LEAF continue to sell in dribs and drabs.\n\nHowever, as battery technology continues to improve – increasing in capacity and reducing in price – the white paper suggests many residents will even look at leaving the grid. In this respect EVs will become vital to energy independence.\n\n\"Rapidly falling battery storage costs may cause some customers to consider disconnection from the grid,\" reads the government study. \"To the extent that this occurs, it will leave fewer customers to pay for the maintenance of the grid, resulting in even higher prices and driving even more customers off the grid.\"\n\nCars will be a key factor in pushing this shift, with several brands – including Tesla and Mercedes-Benz – looking at affordable home batteries powerful enough to keep households running and off the grid.\n\nWhile Tasmania is banking on electricity and EVs for its future energy strategy, the federal government appears more interested in another zero emission energy source.\n\nFederal science and industry minister Ian Macfarlane recently declared hydrogen, not battery-electricity, to be Australia's automotive transport 'fuel of the future'. He attended the opening of Australia's first hydrogen refuelling station, an initiative funded by Hyundai.\n\nMeanwhile Tesla is also pushing ahead with its own infrastructure on the Australian mainland, with a Goulburn fast charge station installed and plans to have a supercharger network by the end of 2015, allowing Telsa owners to drive from Sydney to Melbourne under electric power.\n\nAnother factor that could play a significant role in the future of EVs in Australia is, naturally, the price of electricity. The Tasmanian white paper notes that \"Retail electricity prices have rapidly escalated, largely as a result of significantly increased investment in networks,\" and will continue to do so.\n\n\"Consumers have responded to higher prices in a range of ways, including by investing in solar PV [photo-voltaic] and energy efficiency measures.\"\n\nIn the long term these responses, in Tasmania at least, are expected to lead to lower levels of electricity consumption, which \"is leading to concerns of a network 'death spiral',\" according to the white paper.\n\n\"This is compounded by tariff settings that are largely consumption based but the costs of providing the network are largely fixed.\"\n\nRooftop solar panels in Tasmania are predicted to jump from 70 mega watts to 300 mega watts in the next 10 years, which won't be good for electricity providers, but it will be good for people who want to run their household and indeed their motor vehicle cheaply and with zero emissions.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Australia's energy future – should the mainland try and follow Tasmania and encourage the adoption of EVs or are the other options – hydrogen, LPG, diesel – more feasible?

{"text": "\"Mass incarceration makes our communities worse off, and we need to do something about it,\" President Obama declared at the 106th NAACP Convention in Philadelphia on Tuesday, before laying out the steps he'd like to see Washington take to address the problem.\n\nThe president acknowledged the \"long history of inequity\" in the criminal justice system but hailed the growing consensus among Republicans and Democratsthat it must be addressed.\n\n\"We can't close our eyes anymore,\" Mr. Obama said. \"People of all political persuasions are starting to think we need to do something about this.\"\n\nThe president cited several glaring statistics illustrating the extent of the nation's incarceration issues: For instance, the United States is home to 5 percent of the world's population but 25 percent of its prisoners. The prison population has doubled in the last two decades, he noted, and the U.S.'s incarceration rate is now four times higher than China's.\n\nWhile some people deserve to be in jail, Mr. Obama said, \"in far too many cases, the punishment simply does not fit the crime.\"\n\n\"If you're a low level drug dealer... you owe some debt to society,\" he said. \"But you don't owe 20 years. You don't owe a life sentence.\"\n\nThe president noted that the flaws in the criminal justice system disproportionately impact communities of color.\n\n\"This is not just anecdote,\" he said. \"A growing body of research shows people of color are more likely to be stopped, frisked, questioned, charged, detained. African Americans are more likely to be arrested, more likely to be sentenced to more time, for the same crime.\"\n\nMeanwhile, incarceration comes at a huge cost to taxpayers -- specifically $80 billion a year.\n\nFor that much money, Mr. Obama said, \"We could have universal preschool for every three-year-old and four-year-old in America... We could double the salary of every high school teacher in America.\"\n\nReforming the system, the president said, should happen in three areas: \"In the community, the courtroom and in the cell block.\"\n\n\"I want to begin with the community because I believe crime is like any other epidemic -- the best time to stop it is before it starts,\" he said, calling for investments in areas like pre-kindergarten.\n\nHe also referenced the so-called school-to-prison pipeline and racial inequities in school discipline. \"Are we letting principals and parents deal with one set of kids, and we call the police on another set of kids? That's not the right thing to do,\" he said.\n\nAs for the courtroom, Mr. Obama declared, \"We need to lower long mandatory minimum sentences or get rid of them entirely... We should pass a sentencing reform bill through Congress this year.\"\n\nHe called for investments in prison alternatives, such as drug court programs and probation programs.\n\nReforms must also take place in the cell block, he said. The president praised Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas for his work on the issue and his assertion that \"virtually all the people in our prisons will eventually, someday, be released.\"\n\nMr. Obama added, \"We have to make sure as they do their time and pay back their debt to society, that we are increasing the possibility that they can turn their lives around.\"\n\nThe president said he's ordered the Department of Justice to review the over-use of solitary confinement. He said it's also time to address other problems in prison conditions, such as over-crowding and gangs in prison. \"We should not be tolerating rape in prison, and we should not be making jokes about it in our popular culture,\" he added.\n\nMr. Obama also called for reforms to help former prisoners, such as making it easier for convicted felons to vote and get a job.\n\nAlong with praising Cornyn, Mr. Obama also specifically mentioned Sen. Rand Paul's work on the issue. \"To his credit, he's been consistent on this,\" Mr. Obama told the crowd.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Obama warned that \"we have to stand up to those\" who are trying to cut government investments in areas like early childhood education.\n\n\"Today I've been talking about the criminal justice system, but we have to recognize it's not something we do in isolation,\" he said."}
{"text": "Wednesday, October 07, 2009\n# 3810\nIf you are a frequent reader of scientific studies, you are no doubt aware that science isn't always neat, tidy, orderly and clear.   We get conflicting data, and analysis, all of the time.  \nSorting out what is true . . . or at least likely to be true . . . is a continual challenge for the reader.\nUp until recently the poster child for scientific ambiguity has been the debate over whether surgical masks are effective in protecting Health Care Workers from influenza. We get studies that say they work, and studies that say they are practically useless.  \nBut now, at least temporarily, the debate over whether seasonal flu vaccines offer protection against the novel H1N1 virus , or increase your odds of catching it , takes center stage.\nIn the past couple of weeks we've heard a good deal about ` The Canadian Problem' , an as yet unpublished study that links getting last year's seasonal flu vaccine with an increased likelihood of catching the novel H1N1 virus.\nThis study is still undergoing peer review, but its impact has already been felt across much of Canada.   Many provinces have curtailed their seasonal flu vaccination programs for those under the age of 65, out of concern that taking the seasonal vaccine may exacerbate the pandemic.\nThe WHO and the CDC meanwhile say they've seen no evidence to support this supposed link. They continue to recommend taking the seasonal flu vaccine.\nAs if this weren't confusing enough, now we get a study published in the BMJ ( British Medical Journal) that suggests exactly the opposite - that getting the seasonal flu vaccination may be slightly protective against the swine flu.\nThis also runs contrary to what we've heard from the CDC , which  maintains that the seasonal vaccine is not expected to offer any protection against the novel H1N1 swine flu virus.\nPublished 6 October 2009, doi:10.1136/bmj.b3928\nDesign Frequency matched case-control study.\nSetting Specialty hospital in Mexico City, March to May 2009.\nParticipants 60 patients with laboratory confirmed influenza A/H1N1 and 180 controls with other diseases (not influenza-like illness or pneumonia) living in Mexico City or the State of Mexico and matched for age and socioeconomic status.\nMain outcome measures Odds ratio and effectiveness of trivalent inactivated vaccine against influenza A/H1N1.\nResults Cases were more likely than controls to be admitted to hospital, undergo invasive mechanical ventilation, and die. Controls were more likely than cases to have chronic conditions that conferred a higher risk of influenza related complications. In the multivariate model, influenza A/H1N1 was independently associated with trivalent inactivated vaccine (odds ratio 0.27, 95% confidence interval 0.11 to 0.66) and underlying conditions (0.15, 0.08 to 0.30). Vaccine effectiveness was 73% (95% confidence interval 34% to 89%). None of the eight vaccinated cases died.\nConclusions Preliminary evidence suggests some protection from the 2008-9 trivalent inactivated vaccine against pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 , particularly severe forms of the disease, diagnosed in a specialty hospital during the influenza epidemic in Mexico City.\nSo, the reader is now in the unenviable position of having to decide decide between 3 different stances. \n  Taking the Seasonal Flu vaccine may increase your odds of getting the pandemic flu (Canadian Unpublished Study) Taking the Seasonal Flu vaccine may decrease your odds of getting the pandemic flu (BMJ study) Taking the seasonal flu vaccine has no effect on your risks of acquiring the pandemic flu (CDC)\nThese are not trivial matters.   Lives, and global public health policies, hinge on sorting this all out as quickly ( and scientifically accurately ) as possible. This kind of ambiguity and debate, while fascinating to us disease-geeks-types, no doubt breeds apathy and mistrust among the public.\nThis BMJ study is, admittedly, on a very small number of patients.  The Canadian study is unpublished, and so we have very little to go on.   So, as always, Caveat Lector.\nAs far as which study is right, I've no idea.\nSince I've already gotten my seasonal shot, I'm hoping it's either option #2 or #3. \nBut I suppose only time will tell."}

{"text": "While proponents of mandating a higher minimum wage claim it would help Michigan residents get off food stamps, the evidence from past increases shows this not to be true.\n\nIn 2007, the minimum wage in Michigan increased from $5.15 an hour to $6.95 an hour. That year, the number of people on food stamps increased from 1.1 million to 1.2 million. In 2008, the minimum wage increased again from $6.95 an hour to $7.15. Again, the number of food stamp recipients went up from 1.2 million to 1.26 million.\n\nYet, the left-leaning Center for American Progress recently released a report that claimed raising the minimum wage to $10.10 would get at least 110,000 families in Michigan off food stamps. President Obama and political allies are pushing for the higher mandated wage. The Center for American Progress has strong ties to the Clinton and Obama administrations. The group's president, Neera Tanden, worked as director of domestic policy for the Obama-Biden presidential campaign and also has worked as policy director for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.\n\n\"The economy is complex and there are many factors working among each other,\" said James Hohman, assistant director of fiscal policy at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy. \"Michigan's experience shows that the direction of the economy is the most important factor in whether food stamp rolls increase or decrease.\"\n\nThe Employment Policies Institute cited a half dozen studies and analyses from 2003 to 2009 that highlights why a correlation between minimum wage and food stamps is on shaky ground.\n\nEPI pointed out that in 2009, the average family income of those earning minimum wage was more than $48,000. The 2009 U.S. Census stated that 16.5 percent of those earning minimum wage were raising a family on minimum wage. The remaining 83.5 percent were teenagers living with working parents, adults living alone or married couples with dual incomes.\n\nAnd EPI cited a Ball State University study that found when the federal minimum wage increased by 40 percent from July 2007 to July 2009 there were 550,000 fewer part-time jobs as a result of the increase.\n\nAccording to EPI, when employers are faced with higher labor costs, they hire workers with more work experience and higher skill levels. Workers with lower skills and less work experience are pushed out of the market for jobs.\n\nMandating a higher minimum wage also is associated with job losses. A Congressional Budget Office report released in February said increasing the wage mandate to $10.10 per hour would lead to the loss of about 500,000 jobs. The report also said some employees would be paid more, but that would come at the expense of others being laid off. The laid off workers would be more likely to use food stamps and other government programs.\n\nThe results of the Center for American Progress study contradict what studies have shown about minimum wage, said Antony Davies, an associate professor of economics at Duquesne University.\n\n\"Increases in the minimum wage may or may not result in an increase in overall unemployment,\" Davies said. \"However, increases in the minimum wage do result in a shifting in employment away from lesser skilled, lesser educated workers toward higher skilled, higher educated workers. Minimum wage increases provide increases in incomes for workers who keep their jobs, but cause decreases in incomes for workers who are laid off.\"\n\nDavies said in times of prosperity, food stamp use declines because more people are working. Also, when the economy is thriving, there tends to be an increase in minimum wage.\n\n\"There is no causal relationship between minimum wage and food stamps, rather rising incomes are driving both of the measures,\" Davies said.\n\nSmall business owners in Michigan say a mandated wage increase would lead to layoffs and higher prices.\n\n~~~~~\n\nSee also:\n\nWho Is Behind the Minimum Wage Increase Drive?\n\nBars, Restaurants Could See 280 Percent Increase In Costs With Minimum Wage Ballot Proposal\n\nSchauer, Other Michigan Dems Call For Higher Minimum Wage While Paying Their Interns Nothing\n\nDebate Du Jour: Minimum Wage Takes Center Stage\n\nMinimum Wage For Thee But Not For Me?\n\nHarming the Competition: Why some companies want a higher minimum wage\n\nMinimum Wage Increase: A Serious Effort or Just Rhetoric?\n\nMinimum Wage, Maximum Harm\n\nBig Business Supports Minimum Wage Hikes"}

Watch their beautiful wedding video here:vimeo.com/112371211We are fundraising money, because Anthony is not working anymore & is taking care of his health & spending time with family full time. On average, ALS patient care can be upwards of $200K a year. Although Anthony is currently not at that point of dependency, ALS only gets worse & is a progressive disease...we know it too well. This is why we're attempting to prepare for a financially stress free life.Anthony will ultimately need a wheelchair accessible home... he will need help paying for health insurance, future medical expenses, food, phone, car, rent, basic living costs... etc and hopefully a little room to enjoy his healthier years...We sincerely appreciate any and all support.

He radiates joy, love and compassion. He loves to laugh, takes the most gorgeous photographs, has mad skateboarding skills, plays the acoustic guitar and is an artist at heart. He is LOVED by all, and he is a miraculous gift to our family and everyone else who knows him.On Monday, January 27th, Anthony received the devastating news that he has ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. ALS runs in the family. His grandmother died from it, and his mother currently has it. Ironically, Anthony had been helping to take care of his mother and is a dedicated advocate and voice in the fight to cure ALS when this all happened. In his own words:\"During the past six months, my hands became noticeably weaker, and both arms began twitching constantly. My last few weddings, I had difficulties changing my camera settings, because my hands were so weak. I tried to convince myself it was carpal tunnel, even though I knew these were the same symptoms my mother and grandmother experienced before they were diagnosed with ALS. I finally got health insurance and was seen by a neurologist. I was diagnosed soon after.\"To attempt to preserve the muscle that's left in his hands and arms, he can no longer work as a wedding photographer. The equipment is too heavy, and the days are too long. Once muscle is lost, it cannot be regained, and the risk is not worth it. He is liquidating his camera equipment to raise funds to pay for his medical insurance and costs, as well as his business expenses and taxes that he currently owes, but it will not be enough since he can no longer work... So, we are fundraising for him. All contributions go directly into Anthony's PayPal account, and you do not need a PayPal account to contribute.

Motor neurons reach from the brain to the spinal cord and from the spinal cord to the muscles throughout the body. The progressive degeneration of the motor neurons in ALS eventually leads to their death. When the motor neurons die, the ability of the brain to initiate and control muscle movement is lost. With voluntary muscle action progressively affected, patients in the later stages of the disease may become totally paralyzed.

I recently watched all nine seasons in a few months, and decided that I absolutely had to recreate the iconic work space with LEGO Digital Designer. Before I knew it, what had originally been a small, forgotten LDD file of Micheal Scott's desk evolved into a 2599 piece scale model The Office.\n\nThe model.\n\nIn order to be realistic, I tried to copy nearly every detail on every desk. Out of the month of building I put into this, the majority of the time was devoted to tweaking the details on all the desks. Every desk has a computer and a phone by default, but each one also has its own unique details (some more than others).\n\nTo make the rendering of images easier, I added a few pieces that allow Micheal's office and the conference room to detach from the rest of the model. Also, although no images of this are included, the wall on the far right is connected to a hinge that allows the other half of the model to be opened up. These functions make it easier to view and detach different parts of the model and adjust the position of the minifigures.\n\nThe minifigures.\n\nA total of 16 minifigures are included along with the model. They all (for the most part) include accessories that appeared during some point on the show. Alternate wigs, hats, and bodies are also included to recreate classic moments from the show.\n\nLarger accessories are included for some of the minifigures such as Kevin's drum set.\n\nA list of minifigures and accessories is as follows:\n\nMicheal: \"World's best boss\" mug, Dundie award, Santa hat.\n\nJim: Dwight's stapler in Jell-O, Dwight costume.\n\nDwight: Bobble head, beet, pumpkin head.\n\nPam: Paint brush, paint palette.\n\nKevin: Chile pot (\"The trick is to under cook the onions.\"), M&Ms jar, drum set, drum sticks.\n\nAngela: Assorted stuffed animals, cat (\"Save Bandit!\").\n\nOscar: Printed computer screen with \"Kevin as Cookie Monster\" parody.\n\nErin: Candy bowl, purse.\n\nPhyllis: Knitting project, knitting needles, assorted stuffed animals, Santa suit with hat.\n\nStanley: Pretzel, crossword puzzle.\n\nAndy: Banjo, microphone and stand.\n\nMeredith: Wine glass.\n\nCreed: Mung beans (\"I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk.

{"text": "POLITICO Pro Pence scores conservative points on Medicaid expansion\n\nIndiana Gov. Mike Pence, a potential 2016 presidential contender, announced Tuesday that he had won federal approval for a form of Medicaid expansion that includes elements championed by conservatives.\n\nIndiana becomes the tenth state with a Republican governor to take up the Obamacare Medicaid expansion, though Pence won some concessions that could give him conservative bragging rights. For instance, people eligible for the Indiana program would have to contribute to a health savings account — and some will lose their coverage and get locked out for six months if they don't pay up.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nPence sought to find a way of enabling Indiana to accept billions of federal Affordable Care Act dollars to cover 350,000 uninsured adults, while also promoting some of his own ideas about free market approaches to health care, and personal responsibility.\n\nHis approach, known as Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0, is different from that of other potential 2016 contenders like GOP Govs. Chris Christie and John Kasich. They both enacted straight Obamacare Medicaid expansions in their states and didn't negotiate a compromise with the federal government on how to do it.\n\nAll of the Medicaid expansion plans cover people up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. The federal government pays the full cost through 2016 and at least 90 percent after that. Including Indiana, 28 states and the District of Columbia have enacted the Obamacare option.\n\nPence — who insisted Tuesday that he still wants Obamacare to be repealed — has long tried to show that he can bring about conservative alternatives to Washington. He described the plan as a victory for Indiana's working poor and said it would empower them to provide for themselves. Health care advocates on a national level had urged CMS to reject several elements of the proposal, though Pence had the support of the state's hospital association and Indiana-based advocacy groups.\n\n\"We were always willing to compromise on the details of this plan,\" he said Tuesday. \"We were never willing to compromise the principles of personal responsibility.\" Medicaid expansion will kick in in Indiana on Feb. 1.\n\nConservatives cried foul when Pence first announced that he would seek to get an expansion model approved that they describe as less conservative than the original Healthy Indiana Plan, created by his predecessor Gov. Mitch Daniels.\n\nAs Pence pointed out on Tuesday, Daniels' program was approved with bipartisan support from the Indiana Statehouse. It included a longer lock-out period for people who didn't pay into their accounts, enrollment caps and premium payments as a condition of eligibility for people who had incomes below the poverty line. Those conditions were jettisoned during Pence's negotiations with federal officials over what was allowable under Obamacare expansion.\n\nIndiana submitted its Medicaid expansion proposal in July for federal approval, and silence over the course of several months led observers to believe that negotiations had stalled over details that were unpalatable to the Obama administration. But Pence ended up getting several conservative ideas approved.\n\nHe didn't get a work requirement, but Indiana will try to encourage employment through a state-funded incentive program. All enrollees will also pay copays if they make an unnecessary trip to the emergency room, and individuals with incomes below the poverty level must pay copays — consistent with current Medicaid rules — if they don't contribute to their health savings accounts.\n\nSen. Dan Coats, an Indiana Republican, on Tuesday lauded the state for being a national leader \"by creating state-based, innovative ideas for governing.\"\n\nPence said he thought the new plan could be a model for the country, and there are signs of interest from other states. In Wyoming, a legislative committee said they supported a proposal for Medicaid expansion modeled off the Indiana plan, instead of the model developed by Gov. Matt Mead. North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory has said he is looking at other states' waivers for inspiration.\n\nAnd the feds' approval of another red state's approach could move efforts in Tennessee and Utah, where governors are trying to gain support for expansion in their state legislatures.\n\nLike Tennessee's proposed plan, Pence said Indiana hospitals will help fund the program. Cigarette taxes will also finance the plan.\n\nIndiana Hospital Association President Doug Leonard said in a statement, \"By leveraging billions of dollars in available funding, we can strengthen the state's health care safety net, which is strained by the rapidly growing costs of uncompensated care. All Hoosiers will reap tremendous benefits from this decision.\"\n\nSarah Wheaton contributed to this report."}
{"text": "The idea of tactical yoga pants intrigued me from the get go. Since 5.11 introduced the concept at SHOT Show, I've been asked by several women to put them through their paces. The company sent me a pair simply wrapped in plastic with a tag stating the size (small) and color (\"Tundra\"). It's not like a product called \"Raven Range Tights\" (RRT) needs a fancy package . . .\n\n\"Tundra\" is marketing speak for dark green. The pants are tagless. OpSec rules! I can take a yoga class in my RRTs without announcing my tacticoolosity. The 5.11 tights aren't as soft as most yoga pants, but God knows they are sturdy. The belt loops and waistband are stitched with parachute-like panache. Next step…putting them on.\n\nThe tactical yoga pants are really sung from the knee down and looser up top. It's a positive point, which I'll explain in a moment. First, cardio . . .\n\nAfter 30 minutes of strenuous exercise I concluded that the RRTs \"sweat wick\" as advertised. Later, I did an hour of yoga in the 5.11 tights. I was mostly looking for their ability to facilitate a range of motion, especially as the RTTs are not soft and the reinforced knee made me worry a bit about their flexibility. Again, mission accomplished. I didn't use a belt while doing yoga, but they didn't slip down.\n\nThe next day I put on the RRTs, grabbed my EDC and AR and headed out to the range. I deployed my Rekkr Custom Kydex IWB style concealment holster.\n\nThanks to the RTT's industrial grade waistband and belt loops I could tool-up as per normal. The tights remained comfortable and effective after repeated draws. The fact that they weren't tight around my backside meant I could move while standing with my side arm in the waistband. As I said above, the extra room is a good thing not a bad thing.\n\nOn the downside, after a day of working out and shooting, the RRTs were not ideal for lounging around and relaxing with a hot cup of coffee. The seams are noticeable. As snug as they are — without being soft like yoga pants — the RRTs wouldn't be my first choice for relaxation. That said, they were more comfortable that jeans or other work-type pants.\n\nAt $89.99, 5.11's Raven Range Tights aren't cheap. But they're ready for TEOTWAWKI and they bring welcome style to range days, without sacrificing utility. If you buy one pair of tactical yoga pants, this is it.\n\n5.11 Raven Range Tights\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nFABRIC: Stretch Ponte di Roma fabric, antimicrobial, moisture-wicking\n\nFEATURES: Elastic waistband, ankle-length inseam, abrasion panels, belt loops\n\nCOLORS: Black and Tundra (dark green)\n\nSIZES: XS – XL\n\nPRICE: $89.99 msrp\n\nRATINGS\n\nQUALITY * * * * *\n\nThe double reinforced knee and sturdy material make these ideal to wear all day. They won't tear easily and the seams are stitched together well.\n\nPRICE * * * *\n\nAt $89.99, these are some pricey pants. But they're perfect for yoga and tactical ops, or tactical yoga ops. Result.\n\nPERFORMANCE (YOGA) * * * *\n\nThe seams were a bit bothersome especially compared to \"normal\" yoga pants, but they got the job done. They stretched as needed and didn't restrict movements when doing poses.\n\nPERFORMANCE (SHOOTING) * * * * *\n\nThese are now my go-to pants for the range. They're comfortable and sturdy and loose in just the right spots to make them work for my preferred IWB holster. Any pair of boots should go right over the pants because they are so tight around the bottom.\n\nOVERALL * * * * *\n\nWhat well-armed woman doesn't want tactical yoga pants? 5.11 did a great job of creating something genuinely useful for women."}
{"text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nTwo studies published this week show that the Zika virus seems to prefer brain cells — and that it can cause many different types of damage to those cells.\n\nOne of the studies shows that Zika — but not its close cousin, the dengue virus — destroys developing nerve cells. Another describes the cases of two Zika patients who developed nerve damage similar to that caused by multiple sclerosis.\n\nConfocal microscopy of human neural stem cell culture infected with Zika virus (red). Cell nuclei are shown in blue. Credit: Erick Loiola, PhD and Rodrigo Madeiro, PhD - IDOR / Science\n\nBoth add to the growing body of evidence that Zika virus, once virtually ignored as a rather harmless infection, is causing severe and sometimes deadly birth defects and other types of damage to victims of all ages. And because it's spreading so fast among so many people, it's adding up to thousands of victims.\n\nPatricia Garcez of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil and colleagues used human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells — lab-created stem cells — which they coaxed into become immature brain cells.\n\nZika virus infected and killed them, they report in the journal Science.\n\nWhen they directed these iPS cells to become little batches of brain cells, the virus slowed their growth and development by 40 percent.\n\nBut when Garcez's team tried the same thing with dengue virus, they did not see the same effects. The virus, which is very closely related to Zika, infected the nerve and brain cells but did not kill them.\n\n\"Though our study is small, itmay provide evidence that in this case the virus has different effects on the brain than those identified in current studies.\"\n\nThis helps explain why Zika's effects were so unexpected. Viruses such as rubella and those in the herpes family are well known to cause birth defects and sometimes severe neurological effects in adults and children. But not so-called flaviviruses such as Zika and its cousin dengue.\n\nZika was once believed to cause little more than a rash and some achiness – and even then only in a small percentage of people infected. Now it's known it can have serious effects on developing fetuses and adults as well.\n\nA second study shows more startling neurological effects.\n\nDr. Maria Lucia Brito Ferreira of Restoration Hospital in Recife, Brazil and colleagues described the cases of two Zika patients who developed a condition called acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. It's an inflammation of the brain and spinal cord that damages the protective fatty myelin layer that covers nerve cells.\n\nThat's similar to what multiple sclerosis does, but it's usually temporary – although the recovery can take months.\n\nFour more patients developed Guillain-Barre syndrome, a paralyzing condition hat's also caused by nerve damage, Ferreira's team said in remarks released ahead of an annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology.\n\n\"Though our study is small, itmay provide evidence that in this case the virus has different effects on the brain than those identified in current studies,\" said Ferreira.\n\nWhen they left the hospital, five of the six people still had problems with movement and coordination and one had memory problems.\n\n\"This doesn't mean that all people infected with Zika will experience these brain problems. Of those who have nervous system problems, most do not have brain symptoms,\" said Ferreira. \"However, our study may shed light on possible lingering effects the virus may be associated with in the brain.\"\n\nZika's spreading in both Latin America and the South Pacific. The mosquito-borne virus is blamed for thousands of birth defects, notably one called microcephaly, marked by an underdeveloped brain and head.\n\nThe World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention both warn travelers going to Zika-affected regions to do what they can to avoid mosquito bites. They're telling pregnant women to stay away completely if they can.\n\nBoth also warn travelers who may bring Zika back home to avoid infecting loved ones sexually and to watch out not to get bitten by mosquitoes at home.\n\nThe CDC predicts small, localized outbreaks in the U.S. as warmer weather fuels the breeding of the mosquitoes that spread Zika."}
{"text": "It's been almost 13 years and the nonsense shows no sign of stopping. It is still amazing to me – thousands of direct eyewitnesses saw two passenger jets plow into each of the twin towers. Further, there are countless videos from multiple vantage points clearly showing these events.\n\nAlso keep in mind that after the first jet hit the North Tower, media attention descended onto the towers. The media was in full force when the second jet hit the South Tower. In addition, many personal video cameras were up and running. It is therefore an extensively documented event.\n\nIn the face of this overwhelming direct eyewitness and corroborating video evidence, who could deny the basic fact that two jets struck those two towers that morning?\n\nWell, this guy, for one. I know this is beating a dead horse, but I think it is useful to have occasional reminders of the extent to which people can deceive themselves into absurd conclusions. It should also be noted that, while apparently declining in more recent polls, belief in a 9-11 conspiracy remains high. Averaging all surveys, less than half of those asked accept the standard explanation that 9-11 was an Al Qaeda plot.\n\nOne of the ways in which people arrive at and then reinforce conclusions that are demonstrably absurd is anomaly hunting. This is a common part of the conspiracy theory process – look at any complex event and hunt for any apparent anomaly. Does anything not make immediate sense or stick out as unusual.\n\nThis is a form of data-mining – looking at a very large set of data and hunting for patterns or statistical quirks. Any large set of data will contain these things by chance alone. All the details that make up a complex event represent a large data set, and so apparent anomalies and unusual coincidences should be common.\n\nThis mental error is then combined with the false conclusion that because there are apparent anomalies, something must be wrong with the superficial or official story. Conspiracy theorists are very impressed when they find anomalies, because they work from the false premise that if there weren't a cover-up, then no such anomalies should be apparent.\n\nApparent anomalies, however, are everywhere. If you look you will find them.\n\nThis latest YouTube video is a perfect example of anomaly hunting. The author, pouring over videos of jets crashing into towers, thinks he has found evidence that the video was faked. He points to the appearance that the wing of the plane seems to pass behind a building in the background. He concludes this is a \"layering error\" and is therefore evidence the entire video is faked.\n\nThere is a far simpler explanation, however. This is simply an optical illusion and an artifact of the video. The shade of the wing is very similar to that of the building in the background, so when the two are overlayed the video camera cannot separate the two. The wing therefore disappears into the building, which our brains then interpret as it being behind the building.\n\nYou can see that this is true because on the nearer side of the building, which is more lit by sunlight, the wing is much darker and we can see it pass in front of this side of the building.\n\nThe video, therefore, is not evidence of CG. This is just what happens when you zoom in on such video – artifacts appear and can sometimes produce optical illusions.\n\nThis, of course, is a much simpler explanation than the claim that thousands of eyewitnesses were somehow deceived, that hundreds of videos were all faked, that the passengers on those jets were made to disappear, the buildings were demolished, and all the other elements of that day were faked without leaving any hard evidence behind. The more you think about the implications of a conspiracy, the more absurd it becomes.\n\nThe new video also claims that the jet would not have penetrated the building as it did. This is just naive, and a bit arrogant. Why would anyone presume to know intuitively what should happen when a passenger jet loaded with fuel flies into a building at 466 mph. The kinetics of such an event are totally outside our everyday experience.\n\nThe momentum of that jet had to go somewhere, and the exploding fuel would have provided even more energy. Further, the towers were constructed with their supports on the inside, and so the outer shell was more fragile than for most other similar buildings.\n\nThis point is not even an anomaly.\n\nThe true lesson here is to never underestimate the extent to which people can convince themselves that the absurd is true."}
{"text": "\"Just because the Philippines or Vietnam are not as large as China doesn't mean that they can just be elbowed aside,\" said the US president. China's response? In effect, \"yes we can\". And that has become clear in the last few days. Aerial photography shows that China is using land reclamation to expand two islands in the Paracel Islands chain and to build or expand seven others in the Spratly group. Both island groups are in the South China Sea where China has drawn a so-called \"nine dash line\" that lolls like a great tongue dipping down and across the sea. Beijing's claims clash with those of the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei. \"The bottom line\", says Alan Dupont, a professor of international security at NSW University, \"is that China is terraforming its way to control of the South China Sea by creating artificial islands and then militarising them.\" Dupont says \"it's pretty clear-cut\" that Beijing is seeking to \"control the South China Sea and the eastern approaches to the Malacca Straits, which is the key choke point for global shipping given that 50 per cent of global trade goes through there.\"\n\nThis is terribly awkward for governments around the world. Few will defend China's relentless expansionism, yet no one is prepared to stand in its way. Beijing's behaviour is in breach of an agreement it signed in 2002 with the ten-nation ASEAN group, the Association of South East Asian Nations. Under the pact, all governments forswore any destabilising action such as building new structures on the disputed islands. But the deal was non-binding. China has waged a years-long go-slow on negotiating a binding code of conduct for the region. Last week the Philippines asked its fellow ASEAN members to say something about it. China was \"poised to consolidate de facto control of the South China Sea,\" the country's Foreign Affairs Secretary, Albert Del Rosario, told his counterparts. \"ASEAN should assert its leadership, centrality and solidarity,\" he said. \"ASEAN must show the world that it has the resolve to act in the common interest.\"\n\nInstead ASEAN showed that it was weak, divided, and unwilling to confront China. It issued a communique expressing concern that land reclamation \"may undermine peace, security and stability in the South China Sea\" yet it failed to name China as the culprit. So ASEAN won't even talk about the problem openly, much less act. Three of the ASEAN countries were reportedly keen to take a tougher line with China – the Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia – but were overruled by the majority. The Foreign Affairs Minister of the host country for the meeting, Malaysia's Anifah Aman said: \"ASEAN's stand is that we want to engage with China.\" He added, \"In short, we are not confrontational.\" That suits Beijing just fine. A few days later, a top Chinese military commander sought to reassure the US about its reef expansions. In a video hookup, China's chief of navy, Admiral Wu Shengli, told his US counterpart, Admiral Jonathan Greenert, that China's reclamation would not affect freedom of navigation or overflight. According to China's Defence Ministry, Admiral Wu told the American: \"We welcome international organisations, the US and relevant countries to use these facilities, when conditions are ripe, to conduct co-operation on humanitarian rescue and disaster relief.\"\n\nSo China is now setting the terms of access to territories which are not, under international law, even Chinese. In sum, it seems China has gotten away with it. As Alan Dupont says, this is \"part of China's strategy for becoming the pre-eminent nation in Asia, and perhaps eventually the pre-eminent nation in the world. This creates a very difficult problem for the Australian government to deal with.\" So far Australia has dealt with it the same way almost all countries have – by pretending that it's not really happening. The benefits of trade and investment with China are lucrative. Governments do not want to put trade relations at risk by confronting Beijing over its bad behaviour in taking territory from weaker states. In the US there is a growing realisation that American forbearance is failing. \"Washington needs a new grand strategy toward China that centres on balancing the rise of Chinese power rather than continuing to assist its ascendancy,\" writes a distinguished American strategist, Bob Blackwill, in a new report for the establishment Council on Foreign Relations."}

{"text": "While hardly considered an \"alt-right\" personality (despite his professed support of Donald Trump), Martin Shkreli today encountered the full fury of the Jack Dorsey social media apparatus scorned, when his Twitter account was suspended. The suspension, reported first by The Verge, is allegedly in retaliation for Shkreli's \"targeted harassment\" against freelance reporter Lauren Duca.\n\nAs Verge notes, Duca had recently made the media spotlight after penning a Teen Vogue essay titled \"Trump is Gaslighting America\" which went viral because, ostensibly, Teen Vogue is one of the few media outlets in the US not considered \"fake news\" by either part of the ideological divide. She was subsequently invited to a face-off with Fox News' Tucker Carlson. That clip in turn also went viral due to Carlson's statement that Duca should stop talking about politics and \"stick to thigh-high boots.\" Following her media appearances, Shkreli, a professed Trump supporter, has decided to troll her.\n\nThe (sexual) tension between the two escalated last week when Duca tweeted a screenshot of a direct message from Shkreli, who in 2015 was briefly described as \"the world's most hated man\" after hiking the price on an anti-parasitic drug 56 times (before it emerged that virtually every other pharma company does the same if to a slighly less shocking extent), refusing to answer questions about alleged fraud, getting arrested on charges of securities fraud (he remains free on $5 million bail), and asking celebs to listen to a rare Wu-Tang Clan album with him.\n\nIn his message he asked her if she wanted to be his date to President-elect Trump's inauguration. Her response: \"I would rather eat my own organs.\"\n\nI would rather eat my own organs pic.twitter.com/IgeCRZqk8w — Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) January 5, 2017\n\nFollowing the exchange, Shkreli added a line to his Twitter bio saying he had \"a small crush on @laurenduca.\" He also changed his profile image to a doctored photo of Duca and her husband, swapping his face into the image. He changed his banner to a collage of photos of Duca, overlaid with lyrics from John Michael Montgomery's 1994 single \"I Swear.\" Stepping up his trolling game, Shrekli also tweeted that he had purchased the domain name \"marrymelauren.com.\" Shkreli's followers then joined in, tweeting more Photoshops of Shkreli with Duca.\n\nSpeaking to The Verge prior to his Twitter suspension, Shkreli said he didn't see his actions as harassment and wouldn't consider them to be \"against Duca's will\" because she hadn't responded to any messages from him or told him to stop. He said he thought the Photoshop images were similar to those someone would make of \"Justin Bieber or any other celebrity.\"\n\nDuca's reaction, however, was less sanguine and at 10:55am she tweeted Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey asking \"How is this allowed\"\n\nBy 1:00pm Eastern, Shrekli's account had been suspended.\n\nPreviously, Twitter made headlines in July 2016 when it permanently banned Breitbart tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos after what Twitter dubbed targeted harassment against Ghostbusters star Leslie Jones. Dorsey responded directly to a tweet from Jones at the time.\n\nVerge's conclusion: \"if you don't want to be harassed on Twitter's platform you can always hope things get bad enough (or you're famous enough) that you can get the CEO's ear.\"\n\nIn early December, shortly after a purge of dozens of \"alt-right\" Twitter accounts, Slate reported that Twitter may even consider banning none other than the Donald Trump:\n\nAsked whether Twitter would ever consider banning key government officials or even the president himself, a company spokesperson responded via email: \"The Twitter Rules prohibit violent threats, harassment, hateful conduct, and multiple account abuse, and we will take action on accounts violating those policies.\" Pressed on whether that meant that, hypothetically, Trump himself could be suspended were he to violate those policies, a spokesperson confirmed: \"The Twitter Rules apply to all accounts, including verified accounts.\"\n\nWith Twitter discourse, both political and mundane, becoming increasingly charged, we expect many more outspoken voices to be unexpectedly muted in months ahead."}
{"text": "In the race to move energy off Canada's West Coast, David Black hasn't garnered much attention. The soft-spoken newspaper magnate is, after all, an outsider, a man with a giant dream to build a refinery near Kitimat, B.C., but pockets too small to make it happen.\n\nNow Mr. Black says he is a month away from signing an early agreement toward a staggering $25-billion in debt financing to build pipelines, supertankers and one of the largest refineries on Earth.\n\n\"We hope to sign this within the next 30 days. We haven't signed it yet,\" the founder of Victoria-based Black Press Ltd. said Wednesday. \"It is a memorandum of understanding that is fairly broad, and we'll be negotiating the details down the road, which is typically the way these things are done.\"\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn the oil patch, the refinery plan has been met with skepticism, given that Mr. Black's experience lies in newspapers, not the complex and enormously expensive world of refining crude. Industry analysts have expressed doubts about his ability to sign firm contracts for fuel sales. They say it could be tough to persuade Canadian oil companies to sell their product in British Columbia, which could curb their ability to secure high prices in the competitive Asian marketplace.\n\nOn Wednesday, in a breakfast speech before the Vancouver Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Black sought to quiet some doubters.\n\nFor the past several months, he has worked with Oppenheimer Investments Group, a Swiss firm that has financed airports around the world and a new city in the Middle East.\n\n\"When we put a project together, we don't do the traditional funding and walk away,\" said Richard Cooke, Oppenheimer's senior managing director for the Americas and Africa. \"We are there from start to finish. So we will be working with David from the permitting to the building to the final end, when the refinery is producing.\"\n\nUnveiled last August at a cost of $13-billion, the Kitimat project is now expected to cost $25-billion: $16-billion for the refinery, $6-billion for an oil pipeline, $2-billion for a natural gas pipeline and $1-billion for supertankers.\n\nOppenheimer has never done anything on that scale.\n\n\"Our specialty is in $1-billion to $3-billion projects. We have done projects over $10-billion,\" Mr. Cooke said in an e-mail.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBut, he told the Vancouver audience, initial deals are in place to cover the entire cost. \"We have arranged and we have the funding committed to do this whole project,\" he said.\n\nThe Kitimat project is the single-largest private investment ever envisioned in British Columbia.\n\nMr. Black envisions a 550,000-barrel-a-day diluted bitumen refinery that would transform oil sands product into fuels like gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. If built, it will bring with it 3,000 operational and 6,000 construction jobs, and a way to have B.C. profit from oil moving across its territory.\n\nMr. Black has also argued for its environmental merits, saying greenhouse gas emissions – which he is hoping to cut in half using new technology – will be produced whether oil is refined in Canada or China.\n\nCoastal waters, he says, will be easier to clean up in case of an accident with refined fuels. And he says there is an economic case to be made for a B.C. refinery, which can use cheaper parts manufactured in Asia and secure access to cheaper oil from Alberta.\n\nThe latter calculation may, however, prove difficult. Canada's energy industry has sought Pacific exports largely because it wants higher Pacific prices.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThat could make it difficult for Mr. Black to secure Alberta oil – and analysts say it may be dangerous to build a project on the assumption that North American oil will stay cheap for decades to come.\n\n\"You're not going to see these $40 discounts like you are today. They're not going to last,\" said Steve Fekete, manager of downstream energy consulting with IHS.\n\nThe sheer cost of the project, and its remoteness, are also likely to prove difficult hurdles, he said.\n\n\"It's going to be tricky.\""}
{"text": "Who could've guessed that SNMNMNM were ahead of the curve? In 2009, you kind of need to know some C++ just to talk about bands. The trend began in dreamy California, which gave us the skuzzy-sweet Nodzzz and Wavves, and then migrated as far as Nebraska (UUVVWWZ) and Glasgow (Dananananaykroyd). Meanwhile, in serious Brooklyn, the Antlers were quietly working on a coincidental antithesis to this fad. Hospice answers silliness with solemnity, jitters with nerve. Their band name simply describes their music: a delicately branching instrument of force.\n\nNot that the Antlers are startlingly original-- they're just swinging for the bleachers at a time when it seems fashionable to bunt, or put your forehead on the bat and spin until you get dizzy. Their widescreen sentimentality comes with an equally familiar back-story. You remember the Bon Iver beat: Sad, bearded dude emerges from self-imposed exile with batch of urgently intimate songs; recruits band; self-releases album that earns surprise web-buzz and gets picked up by venerable indie label. Well, the Antlers used to be the solo project of Peter Silberman, who wrote Hospice while emerging from a period of \"social isolation.\" During the bedroom recording process, two guest musicians (drummer Michael Lerner and multi-instrumentalist Darby Cicci) became permanent members. They self-released Hospice in March, and Frenchkiss picked it up after web- and NPR-praise helped sell out its first pressing.\n\nThe Antlers' skyscraping blend of the ambient and the anthemic is a far cry from Bon Iver's subtle folksiness, but Silberman and Justin Vernon emerged from their traumas seeming equally scoured and eager to reconnect. Hospice is bereft of irony and cynicism, as befits a rather ghastly narrative that feels, perhaps deceptively, autobiographical. Centered around a relationship with a terminally ill child, and evocatively spun from eerie hospital scenery, snippets of conversations with doctors, terrifying dreams, and the periodic intrusions of Sylvia Plath, it becomes a broad meditation on guilt, duty, mortality, and hope in the face of hopelessness. The emotional payload, while artfully couched, is fervent and bleeding. Silberman's affecting earnestness, not to mention his sweet voice, allows him to pull off lines like, \"All the while I know we're fucked/ And not getting un-fucked soon,\" while sounding more prayerful than cynical.\n\nGiven the bluster of the music and its fixation on death and illness (not to mention Silberman's creaky diction and fluttery falsetto), it's impossible not to be reminded of Arcade Fire's Funeral. You could even fix Hospice's precedent a bit earlier-- its starry atmosphere and bludgeoning tenderness evoke Cursive's Domestica with a pop-noise sheen. Like these groups, the Antlers plumb that elusive place where the personally specific becomes universal. They achieve this by keeping the human frailty of the singer intact while inflating his feelings to mythological proportions. You can imagine Silberman, in his isolation, growing world-sized and full; how the emotional forces he grappled with came to seem meteorological.\n\nThis sense of the boundary between self and world-at-large collapsing permeates Hospice. The lyrics cover shades of emotion from despairing persistence (\"Kettering\") to desperate joy (the 21st-birthday fantasia \"Bear\"); the music tells the same story, through quicksilver currents of tension and tranquility. \"Sylvia\" alternates between acute frailty and Queen-caliber bravado, guided by the sort of gnarled electronic line the Antlers love (see also the monotonous buzz whipping around the corners of chipper guitar chords on \"Two\"). But what's really great is how these modulations of weight are integrated into an album-long sweep, with crescendos nested inside decrescendos, coiling surges inside lengthy unwinding passages. It's as vast and empathetic as loneliness itself, a generous framework through which Silberman can show us almost everything: The tiny figure on the horizon and his huge shadow on the mountain, the extreme weathers roiling about him at once symbolic and real."}
{"text": "The issue of the divorce bill promises to be one of the first sticking points in Brexit negotiations | Leon Neal/AFP via Getty Images UK could walk away without paying Brexit bill, ministers believe Senior Tory suggests Berlin is reminded that 'that we remitted one half of all German debt' in 1950s.\n\nLONDON — Theresa May's government will go into Brexit negotiations believing the U.K. could legally walk away from the EU without paying a divorce bill, a Brexit minister signaled Monday.\n\nDavid Jones, the number two in David Davis' Department for Exiting the European Union, backed the findings of a recent report which claimed the U.K. would not be liable for any financial contributions if it left the EU without a deal, during evidence to a committee of MPs Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, a senior Conservative MP risked souring relations with a key EU negotiating partner by urging the government to \"tactfully\" remind European officials that the U.K. helped Germany waive half of its war debt in the 1950s.\n\nBill Cash, chair of the European Scrutiny Committee, said it would be a useful point to make given \"Germany's extremely dominant role in the European Union\" and insisted that \"we really don't owe anything to the European Union.\"\n\nThe issue of the divorce bill promises to be one of the first sticking points in Brexit negotiations. EU and member state officials have suggested that the U.K.'s outstanding liabilities could be as high as €60 billion.\n\nBut in his evidence to the committee, Jones said a House of Lords report, published earlier this month, which concluded that leaving the EU without a deal would mean no legal obligation to pay any financial contribution at all, had been \"extremely helpful.\"\n\n\"I'm sure that it's not gone unnoticed in Brussels and other European capitals for that matter,\" Jones said, signaling that it would be a \"starting point\" for the U.K.'s position on the legality of its financial liabilities to the EU. However, he conceded that there would be \"a big political element to the discussion\" of exit payments.\n\nMay has signaled that the U.K. would be prepared to pay an \"appropriate contribution\" to the EU budget to remain part of certain Europe-wide programs. Her government is determined to avoid a no-deal scenario, but Jones' comments indicate that the prospect of the U.K. walking away without paying anything — leaving a hole in the EU's budget — is seen as strengthening the U.K.'s negotiating hand.\n\nTim Barrow, the U.K.'s permanent representative to the EU, appearing alongside Jones, told the committee that his EU counterparts were looking at legal opinions that \"offer a different interpretation\" of the divorce bill liabilities.\n\nAny large one-off payment to cover liabilities under the EU's existing financial framework, or to meet the U.K.'s share of EU pensions contributions, would not be considered acceptable by Euroskeptic Conservative MPs, a number of senior lawmakers have told POLITICO.\n\nCash, a prominent Euroskeptic, said European Commission chief negotiator Michel Barnier's suggestion of a €60 billion divorce payment had been \"fairly extravagant.\"\n\nSpeaking during the committee hearing, of which he was chair, Cash said: \"Has anybody pointed out to them, or would you make sure that they do understand, that we have been net contributors for many decades to the tune of what is now running at around £9 billion or £10 billion a year, that our accumulated liabilities are offset by the extent to which we have made these massive contributions.\n\n\"And perhaps also to bear in mind,\" he added, \"that back in 1953 there was a thing called the London Debt Agreement, where Germany, for all its malfeasance during the Second World War, and its unprovoked aggression, found that in 1953, in circumstances which were quite remarkable, found that we remitted one half of all German debt.\"\n\nThe London Debt Agreement of 1953 cut by 50 percent Germany's debt liabilities still outstanding from the war reparations demanded following the 1919 Treaty of Versailles. The debt relief agreement, which included several other creditors including France and the U.S., helped kick-start the country's recovery after World War II.\n\nResponding to Cash's comments, Jones said he was \"not entirely sure how tactful one can be when one is mentioning the London Debt Agreement,\" joking that he would refer his EU negotiating partners to Cash."}
{"text": "Jonathan Bernstein is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering politics and policy. He taught political science at the University of Texas at San Antonio and DePauw University and wrote A Plain Blog About Politics. Read more opinion SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email\n\nDonald Trump started whining about the presidential debates last weekend, perhaps setting the stage for skipping them. It should be a reminder that the tradition of televised presidential debates has always been something of a miracle -- one that didn't have to become established, and one that could end fairly easily.\n\nThe first televised debates between U.S. presidential candidates took place in 1960, when Richard Nixon and John Kennedy faced each other four times. It wasn't until 1976 that the next general-election debates took place: President Gerald Ford debated Jimmy Carter three times. In 1980, President Carter debated Ronald Reagan only once. Since then, each election has had either two presidential debates or three.\n\nThe conventional wisdom is that debates are opportunities for the candidate who is losing, and risky for the one who is winning. Challengers are seen as benefiting from being on stage and from appearing on equal terms with an incumbent president.\n\nIn the case of Kennedy and Nixon, both were both running for president for the first time and were in a close election, so it made sense they would agree to debate. But in 1964, Lyndon Johnson, who had become president after Kennedy's assassination in November 1963, had no interest in facing his Republican challenger, Barry Goldwater.\n\nWhat revived these encounters was a historical fluke: the back-to-back elections in 1976 and 1980 in which an incumbent president was in trouble. In 1976, Ford was in the even more flukish position of having been elected to nothing larger than a House of Representatives district before he became president after President Richard Nixon resigned.\n\nThe general-election debates were not an accepted custom until 1984, when President Reagan chose to face Walter Mondale twice. Perhaps Reagan and his campaign believed he had little to fear. It turned out he performed poorly in the first encounter, his only real scare in the campaign that year. But Reagan's willingness to take part in them in the first place established the debates as a regular part of the campaign. No subsequent candidate has been willing to risk the costs of breaking what is by now a long-observed tradition.\n\nUntil now possibly. True, Trump hasn't threatened to back out so far. But speculation that he might doesn't seem far-fetched. After all, while the reality-show host participated in several nomination debates, he dropped out of one before the Iowa caucuses, then refused to participate in any after March 10 (well before his last opponents ended their bids after the May 3 Indiana primary).\n\nHis specific complaint now -- that two scheduled debates are on nights with NFL games -- isn't something to take seriously. As the debate commission has explained, the weeks before the election are full of NFL and college football games and the baseball postseason. With the commission committed to avoiding dates with Jewish holidays (which fall in October this year), conflicts with some major sports events are inevitable. The final 2012 debate between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney went up against both Monday Night Football and the seventh game in the National League championship series.\n\nBut Trump can just bolt from the debates if he chooses to for any reason. And if he does, it's going to make it that much easier for future presidential candidates to do the same thing. If so, we might have to wait a long time for another historical fluke to occur before they are re-established.\n\nDebates are overrated when it comes to determining election outcomes. And the contention that elections should be settled through some one-on-one, high-pressure confrontation is not persuasive.\n\nNevertheless, debates have become an important part of representation. And violating norms is rarely a good idea since so much of U.S. democracy (and all democracies) depends on respecting customs, not on rules. If Trump bails, I hope the TV networks offer to give the time to Clinton anyway. And I hope they do it now, to create a strong incentive for Trump to participate.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nTo contact the author of this story:\n\nJonathan Bernstein at jbernstein62@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story:\n\nKaty Roberts at kroberts29@bloomberg.net"}

{"text": "By: Revanche\n\nPoverty, Water, Animals: On Charity and the Why\n\nA good friend and I were talking about money, charity and volunteering one day and he expressed an opinion that took me aback.\n\nWe're so often in agreement given our remarkably similar backgrounds, we put ourselves through school, supported our families from a young age, worked really hard for a long time to get where we are, that I struggled to understand why he was against volunteering and charity.\n\nWhile I feel that I worked really hard to get here, I didn't get here without help; he feels that he worked really hard to get here and doesn't feel that he got any help so he doesn't feel he should give back to the community at large. Granted, we didn't travel the exact same path but it's hard for me to fathom overlooking the small kindnesses of strangers, like the support from a guidance counselor or a colleague who lobbied for your job security. These are the kinds of things that, though small, add up. They make a difference.\n\nPat Rothfuss, one of my favorite writers and a stand-up kind of guy, explained it far better than I managed that day:\n\nThe simple truth is, Jason, at this point in my life, I have enough money to live comfortably. And in my opinion, if you have enough money to live comfortably and you keep trying to get more and more and more money… well… it's kind of an asshole thing to do. It's like this: if you have one piece of cake, and you eat it, that's fine. If you have two pieces of cake, you should probably share some with a friend. But maybe not. Occasionally we could all use two pieces of cake. But if you have a whole cake, and you eat *all* of it, that's not very cool. It's not just selfish, it's kinda sick and unhealthy.\n\n[…]\n\nThat's why I do all the charity work. Because the world isn't as good as I want it to be.\n\nI don't have a better explanation than that for why I felt compelled to help those who have less. \"The world isn't as good as I want it to be\", so, let's do something about that.\n\nI don't belong to the \"have too many cakes\" camp, particularly since I still support two adult dependents who aren't my children, but while I aim to become that kind of wealthy someday, I don't need to be that wealthy to want to make a difference. I can't save any one person but sometimes a helping hand is all you need, sometimes it gives you enough hope to scrape yourself off the floor and keep going.\n\nAnd that's why I still give. Even though I'm all about personal responsibility and bootstrapping, I remember when a kind gesture was enough to help me do another job, fight another day.\n\nPiC and I get an annual spending allowance out of our shared budget. This is purely for us to spend, however we want, that has nothing to do with necessities which are covered. It's not much, but it's not little either.\n\nI usually hoard mine (SMAAUUGGGG) but this year, I'm making a conscious effort to give between 10-20% to meaningful charities.\n\nPat Rothfuss's Worldbuilders was one: This was a massive fundraising drive to donate to Heifer International. They do good work, without much waste, and helping people make their own livelihood resonates with me.\n\nNathan Fillion and his Clean Water campaign for his birthday is another. I love my Captain and I love clean water for people. I remember, growing up, hearing the stories of how the people in our villages had to carry their water, in buckets, up from the streams. Backbreaking work for survival.\n\nLast, and most dear to my heart, the Humane Society & Rescue Organization where we adopted Doggle. Rescuing animals: FTW!\n\nAlso, as always, I'll be collecting things that are in good shape but we really don't need anymore and donating them to charity that can use them: homeless and battered women/children's shelters.\n\nWhich side of the fence do you stand on? What are your thoughts on the subject?\n\nIf you liked this post and found value in it, I'd appreciate your pin and shares."}

Twinkle Sparkles (ELF safe, not Vegan), ALKALI (Not lip safe, Vegan), and Sparkling Wail (ELF safe, Vegan). For the sample size, each is contained in a clamshell case.  I am personally too clumsy for these cases, so they often get put into regular cases. \nSwatch time! For all swatches, I will have one blended in (no primer) and a square of color on top of NYX milk.  From left to right, we have ALKALI, Twinkle Sparkles, and Sparkling Wail. My first note on these is that Sparkling Wail is so incredibly unique.  If patted down, it creates a dark purple with incredible sparkle (they all do this) but when blended, you get almost a black shade. \nThat bunny bag is packed! Hope you didn't forget about this one. It contains samples from BFTE, Eccentric Cosmetics, Hello Waffle (AH!), and My Pretty Zombie Cosmetics (WHAT!?). Sorry for caps lock on this one, but I am so incredibly excited to get to try the last two, especially Hello Waffle.\nFor this one, it was easier to just show you all the items laid out together. First, we have BFTE who gave us a small sample of Sherbert and a larger sample of Dejavu in a jar. Next is Hello Waffle with Malva (blush), and then Eccentric Cosmetics with Mirage. Finally is My Pretty Zombie with Anthrax. Additionally, we have the two blush samples from May and a full-sized blush from I+T. From left to right, Sherbert, Mirage, Antrax, Malva, and Dejavu. Mirage is my favorite from this batch, as the color reminds me of a mermaid tail. Sherbert I wish was a little more intense, as it nearly disappears on my NC05 (does that even exist? I'm pale) skin.  Malva(blush) and Anthrax would be really cool together, if you wanted that much purple in one look.\n Lastly we have the blushes. Now these are all done without primer with blended on the left. Top to bottom is Psychotic Embers, Whispering Spells, and Vacant Smile. As you may have read from my previous post, I already like the bottom two. Psychotic Embers though... that is my jam! Unfortunately, my new phone has a horrible camera but the color is just gorgeous, especially in the jar. This one I would highly recommend buying for yourself! Also, Malva from before could easily double as a blush. I considered it as eyeshadow, but now I'm thinking more blush. Overall, this was an amazing subscription and I am so fortunate to have gotten on it. I currently pay $12 (USD) for all of these items on a monthly basis with shipping included. You can go up to the full-sized subscription at $18? I would need to go look it up again. Favorites would be Psychotic Embers, Mirage, and Sparkling Wail. Hopefully, I will get around to posting my purchase from Shiro and my Ipsy June subscription (when it gets here). Thank you to reading! Edit: I made some mistakes: 1-Malva is a blush, not an eyeshadow. 2-The reaction was with the pans to the glue. So sorry for these mistakes, and thank you to u\\infamousjoe and u\\ashhole613 for your contributions!"}
{"text": "Rohan Bopanna is angry at missing out on the Arjuna Award and he's blasted the All India Tennis Association (AITA) for the snub. The doubles specialist hit out at the national body for not nominating his name within the deadline i.e. April 28. \"We professional tennis players put in a lot to bring laurels to our country. And no one could question otherwise. However, it is when the system (the Tennis Association in this case) functions sloppily that is not only disrespectful but also robs one of the hope of a deserving acknowledgment,\" Bopanna said in a statement.\n\nThe AITA, however, said that there was no point in sending his name before the deadline since he didn't make the criteria. The federation only decided to send Bopanna's name after he won the mixed doubles title at the French Open with Canadian partner Gabriela Dabrowski on June 14.\n\nThe AITA had chosen Saketh Myneni, winner of two medals at the 2014 Incheon Asian Games, for nomination and the awards selection committee stuck to the deadline. Bopanna's name had been nominated previously but had always been rejected.\n\n\"I am calling out to the lack of professionalism and efficiency by AITA for not sending my nomination for the Arjuna Award before the deadline. I have witnessed many such excuses for the past decade (while I was eligible and my record didn't falter) and then too, have never stood for it,\" Bopanna added.\n\nHowever, the All India Tennis Association (AITA) Secretary General Hironmoy Chatterjee said they had a reason for not sending his application this year.\n\n\"AITA did not send Rohan Bopanna's application for Arjuna award this year since his application was getting rejected all these years because he has not won any medals for the country at the Asian Games,\" AITA secretary general Hironmoy Chatterjee said. \"We knew why it was being rejected all the time.\"\n\nAsked why AITA decided to send his entry in June, Chatterjee claimed, \"I took a chance since it was a Grand Slam. It's like winning a world championship. So, we thought let's send it now.\"\n\nPoints are given for winning medals at the World Championship/World Cup, Asian Games, Commonwealth Games, Asian Championships (biennial) and Commonwealth championships (biennial) while evaluating the applications by the committee.\n\nBopanna had skipped the Incheon Asian Games along with Somdev Devvarman and veteran Leander Paes as the Coorgi had points to defend on the professional tour.\n\nThe AITA had allowed all senior players to miss the Games even though Sania Mirza decided to turn up for country after initially expressing her wish to skip the continental event.\n\nMyneni had won the mixed doubles gold with Sania.\n\nThe AITA official said he understands Bopanna's frustration.\n\n\"I do understand Rohan is disappointed for not getting the award, but it was because he did not meet the criteria for the award in 2016. He should see the criteria before making any comment,\" he said.\n\nChatterjee said winning the Grand Slam title at Roland Garros makes him eligible for next year and they will certainly nominate him.\n\nThe selection committee considered performances between January 2013 and December 2016 and Bopanna has achieved some tremendous results in this period but only on the Pro Circuit, not while representing India in a multi-disciplinary events.\n\nHe reached a career-high rank of three in the world in July 2013 and bagged nine ATP titles, including two Master series (Madrid, 2015 and Monte Carlo, 2017).\n\nHe finished fourth at the Rio Olympic Games with Sania in the mixed doubles and that could have given some weightage to his nomination had AITA sent his application.\n\nCompared to Bopanna, Myneni may not have been very successful on the Tour but has logged enough points for his medal-winning performances at Incheon Games.\n\nBopanna also chose to congratulate Myneni.\n\n\"I want to take this platform to congratulate Saketh Myneni on receiving this award. I couldn't be more proud as I have seen him grow into the player and the man he is today,\" Bopanna mentioned in his statement.\n\n(With PTI inputs)"}

{"text": "I've had some time for the 5.2 battleground scaling changes to sink in, and it's pretty clear that for a twink, the best place to be is at the top of a bracket. If you're going to be level 89 when you zone in, you might as well have level 89 gear and abilities, right?\n\nFor low skew brackets this is really unfortunate. Before it was pretty clear that staying low was the right choice for both PvP and PvE – secondary stat scaling worked in your favor in all environments. Now twinks have to choose between awesomeness in PvP and PvE – for one you go high, the other goes low. You can't be great at both anymore – it's one or the other.\n\n(The only exception is Arenas. Arenas are unaffected by the new scaling. So if you're an Arena junkie, staying low is the way to go.)\n\nI'm not an arena junkie. I locked XP because I like to unwind with battlegrounds but don't like grinding out sets of gear. I've enjoyed being a Big Gun in PvE – bringing 200k DPS to ICC, regularly putting out 100k+ DPS at level 85, of beating the pants off of level 90 DPS in Dragon Soul – but the real reason I locked was to PvP.\n\nSo after a week or two of reflection, I unlocked Cynwise and started queueing up for the leveling brackets with my healer partner and guildmate Rezznul. If I was going to have to level to 89 to be BiS anyways, why not just do it in the BGs? Each level brings a little improvement, but when you're in average ilvl 439 gear at level 85 it's not like you're hurting for that extra gear. It's just icing on top.\n\nConsider that for a minute – one effect of scaling has been to return xp-off twinks back into the leveling brackets. Superbly geared level 70, 80, 85 toons are leaving the xp-off brackets in droves and hitting up the greener pastures of leveling brackets. I outgear everyone. It's ridiculous.\n\nOh. And I have a pocket healer.\n\nI'm not going to gloss over it – I absolutely love it. We absolutely love it. Why shouldn't we? It's ridiculous. And now we can do it without the guilt of weakening ourselves by leveling.\n\nWhen my only regret is leaving behind being a star on Retro Raid Night? That's not really much of a regret.\n\nI do find it interesting that the unlocked 85 bracket is such a more pleasant experience than the locked 85 bracket right now. Most of the Alliance xp-off twinks quit and leveled out after 5.2. The xp-off bracket shifted from a slight Alliance advantage to a dominant Horde one, as teams of Horde healers with competent DPS just ravaged the remaining blue teams with 1-2 twinks. The majority of the Alliance players now seem to be expansion twinks, those returning players who haven't bought Mists of Pandaria and show up in terrible Cataclysm gear. Those players are on the Horde, too, but not as many.\n\nIt's a great time to be a level 85 Horde twink. Seriously. I see some great play and coordinated efforts to protect healers. Alliance healers have vanished and twinks are few and far between. The matches have gone from relatively equal contests to hoping that you don't get steamrolled. I have still won the occasional locked game as Alliance – but it's a frustrating experience, without the teamwork and competence which made even the losses fulfilling experiences.\n\nThis is a strange time to be PvPing. I'm locking and unlocking with abandon. It's not that I've given up on the locked brackets, it's that I'm leveling at the same time.\n\nI don't think bringing twinks back into the leveling brackets was a deliberate effect. I honestly don't think twinks commonly enter in to any design decisions in PvP, with the exception of getting them out of low-level PvP with their separate brackets in 3.2. Removing characters with exceptionally great gear steered by veteran PvPers from the leveling brackets was generally seen as a good thing. Having us return, giving us incentives to play in the leveling brackets … well, it remains to be seen if it's a good thing.\n\nI know I'm having fun. I don't know if my opponents are – but I sure am."}
{"text": "Last week Georgetown failed to close on yet another tremendous opportunity to tally a signature win, this time on its home floor against #10 Kansas. Despite not having watched a single college basketball game all year, my girlfriend made an astute observation in the closing minutes: \"He shoots too much.\" The \"he\" she was referring to was D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera, the Hoyas' leading scorer at 13.3 PPG and the coaches' nomination for preseason Big East Player of the Year. It confirmed something many Hoyas' fans have been wondering as well: How is this the same player who finished sixth in scoring in the Big East last season? Against Kansas, in the midst a miserable 3-of-15 shooting performance, it became apparent that Smith-Rivera's overwhelming desire to shoot took the team's offense out of rhythm.\n\nThus far, the Hoyas have played four teams in KenPom's top 30 and have emerged with a relatively unimpressive 1-3 result. Those losses — to Wisconsin, Butler and Kansas — were by a cumulative of 14 points. So what gives? For one, turnovers. The Hoyas have coughed it up on 21.8 percent of their possessions, resulting in missed key scoring opportunities and failed late game offensive execution. However, the problem seems to extend beyond that. A big theme for Georgetown this season has involved Smith-Rivera shooting more and making less. The junior has yielded some of the scoring responsibilities to Joshua Smith, but he still accounts for 26.2 percent of the team's shots and has converted at a rate lower than both his freshman and sophomore year campaigns. Even more troubling is his three-point shooting. Without backcourt mate Markel Starks to remove some of the defensive focus on the perimeter, it appears that defenses have honed in on him, or he has felt an increased pressure to pick up the offensive slack, resulting in poorer shot selection. Regardless of the reason, Smith-Rivera is shooting just 27.5 percent from deep, in stark contrast to his 39.3 percent mark last season.\n\nThe other issue has been inconsistent play on the wings, both offensively and defensively. Given the arrival of four new faces to fill out the two, three and four spots, the onus falls on the seniors, specifically Jabril Trawick. Trawick has never been a big-time scorer, but his lack of offensive aggression this season has been appalling. At the end of his junior campaign, he tallied double figures in nine of his last 12 outings through a combination of three-point shooting and penetration. Yet this season, he has crossed that threshold only three times and frankly looks hesitant with the ball.\n\nBut in spite of scoring inconsistencies, defensive lapses on the perimeter and an abundance of turnovers, there still are reasons for optimism. For example, the Hoyas' freshmen have shown unusual signs of maturity. Freshman L.J. Peak is averaging 9.3 PPG and is developing quickly, as evidenced by his 18-point outburst against Kansas. Additionally, Paul White and Isaac Copeland, a pair of heralded recruits, have helped to steady the Hoyas' offensive output when Smith-Rivera has gone cold. Above all, the contributions of Smith on the interior have been monumental. No defender, no matter how tall or athletic, has found a way to stop him once he catches the ball on the blocks. Averaging 12.8 points and 6.6 rebounds per game, the 6'10\" senior has formed a formidable defensive front line alongside Mikael Hopkins, a 6'9″ shot-blocking, rebounding extraordinaire.\n\nFor Georgetown, the good has been overshadowed by the bad, but the bad appears to be both temporary and fixable. We know Smith-Rivera can shoot and score in bunches; we know Trawick can play more aggressively; and we know that freshmen generally get better with time. As it stands, all signs point to improvement as the season progresses, but the overwhelming question is when? The answer to that will decide the Hoyas' fate. For now, Hoya fans should remain optimistic and trust that John Thompson III will have his squad, the most talented he has had in several years, in form by March.\n\nJustin Kundrat ( 142 Posts Villanova grad, patiently waiting another 10 years for season tickets.

Rotten Tomotoes currently has the film sitting at 10% and our own John Campea and Kristian Harloff gave the film a negative review on yesterday's Movie Talk. However, on yesterday's show John mentioned that he had sources that claimed Fox Studios significantly altered director Josh Trank's movie just prior to, and during production of the film.\n\nSpeaking of Fox, the studio is moving full speed ahead with their new Channing Tatum lead film Gambit. According to reports, the main female character in the new film will be Bella Donna Boudreaux, a mutant once married to Gambit in an arranged Assassin's Guild marriage. The three actresses up for the role are reported to be Blue Is The Warmest Color star Lea Seydoux, Mission Impossible Rogue Nation star Rebecca Ferguson and Abbey Lee who recently appeared in Mad Max: Fury Road.\n\nBUY OR SELL\n\nAccording to a report on Tracking Board, New Line cinemas is developing another reboot of the iconic Freddy Krueger film Nightmare On Elf Street.

The modern world holds many secrets, but the most astounding secret of all is that witches still live amongst us; vicious supernatural creatures intent on unleashing the Black Death upon the world. Armies of witch hunters battled the unnatural enemy across the globe for centuries, including Kaulder (Diesel), a valiant warrior who managed to slay the all-powerful Queen Witch, decimating her followers in the process. In the moments right before her death, the Queen curses Kaulder with her own immortality, forever separating him from his beloved wife and daughter in the afterlife. Today Kaulder is the only one of his kind remaining, and has spent centuries hunting down rogue witches, all the while yearning for his long-lost loved ones. However, unbeknownst to Kaulder, the Queen Witch is resurrected and seeks revenge on her killer causing an epic battle that will determine the survival of the human race.\n\nAs many of you know, Warner Bros and director Steven Spielberg have been gearing up to adapt the popular novel Ready Player One into a feature film. Yesterday the studio officially announced that the film will hit theatres on December 15th 2017. The book is described like this: In the year 2044, reality is an ugly place. The only time teenage Wade Watts really feels alive is when he's jacked into the virtual utopia known as the Oasis. Wade's devoted his life to studying the puzzles hidden within this world's digital confines—puzzles that are based on their creator's obsession with the pop culture of decades past and that promise massive power and fortune to whoever can unlock them. But when Wade stumbles upon the first clue, he finds himself beset by players willing to kill to take this ultimate prize. The race is on, and if Wade's going to survive, he'll have to win—and confront the real world he's always been so desperate to escape.\n\nI know we've got a bunch of Bronies at the table, so you'll all be thrilled to hear that Lionsgate and Hasbro are teaming up to bring a feature length My Little Pony movie to the big screen.

It can only be purchased by Counter-Terrorists on bomb defusal maps. It halves the time required to defuse the bomb (five seconds instead of the usual ten). It is automatically used when defusing the bomb and can be used an unlimited amount of times.\n\nPossessing the defuse kit adds a symbol of a pair of pliers to the player's HUD under the player's inventory. In Source and Global Offensive, when playing as a Counter-Terrorist or as a spectator, the scoreboard shows a defuser icon next to the name of the player for players possessing a defuse kit.\n\nIn Global Offensive, the defusal kit is given to all CT players for free in Casual Bomb Scenario at the start of a round. It still needs to be purchased in Competitive Bomb Scenario.\n\nIf a Counter-Terrorist dies, their Defuse Kit will be dropped, and other Counter-Terrorist without a Defuse Kit can pick it up. Interestingly, if a CT begins defusing the bomb and had somehow picked up a defusal kit at the same time, the C4 will still require 10 seconds to defuse and not 5. This can be done by jumping on the C4, begin the defusal process, and then obtaining the defusal kit. However, if the defusal process is restarted when following the aforementioned fact, the bomb can be defused in 5 seconds.\n\nIt is often highly recommended to purchase a kit as a Counter-Terrorist to reduce the time it takes to defuse (this is especially helpful when \"ninja\" defusing). If a team is tighter on economy, then it is also viable to only have two players purchase defuse kits, one stationed at each bombsite to defuse the bomb when the site is clear, or let others pick up their kits to defuse if they die.\n\nThe Defusal kit is the standard equipment in Deleted Scenes. The player will automatically use it when defusing a bomb, and the defuse time is same as in multiplayer (5 seconds). However, the suitcase Nuke and sometimes bombs can also be defused like the C4 but slower and the time needed to defuse is same as defusing C4 without a kit (10 seconds).\n\nIn the Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Tour of Duty campaign, the CT bots will never buy a defuse kit. However, they will pick it up if a defusal kit is dropped in their pathways.\n\nAchievements\n\nBomb Combat Ready\n\nDefuse a bomb with a kit when it would have failed without one.

(Actually, I first encountered working mirrors several years ago in a little-known virtual world called Twinity.)\n\nHere's a snapshot of my HiFi avatar (a standard-issue photo-realistic model from the \"free\" store), wearing a wizard hat and looking at himself in the mirror. I must admit that the ability to adjust what you are wearing just by tugging on it is a very nice feature to have. (I still can't figure out how to resize avatar attachments if they're too big, though.)\n\nYou can walk out of the store wearing something you haven't paid for yet, but if you teleport away from Avatar Island, the unpaid-for item automatically detaches itself from your avatar.\n\nHiFi's currency is called High Fidelity Coin (HFC for short), and anyone can request a free grant of 10,000 HFC as part of the beta test, simply by emailing info@highfidelity.com and giving HiFi your username and associated email address. I understand this takes about three days to process, so I am still impatiently waiting for some currency so I can finally buy things! (You cannot yet buy HFC using your credit card, as you can with Sansar dollars.)\n\nAnother interesting thing about this new endeavour is that it is an in-world shopping model, unlike Sansar's Web-based Sansar Store. There are even little green \"recycle\" bins in the stores, where you can deposit items you decided you don't want to buy after all. The High Fidelity shopping experience goes so far as to include check-out stands in each store, where you \"scan\" items that you wish to purchase, just like you can do at the self-check-out kiosks at many real-world stores and supermarkets!\n\nI did notice that you have to type in your passphrase on the user tablet which pops up when you use the check-out stands, which is still a real pain in the ass when you are in a VR headset. I'm still not sure how I feel about the whole tablet metaphor in High Fidelity. Sometimes I find it useful, other times I just find it irritating. At least you can reposition it so it doesn't block your view.\n\nHere's a YouTube promotional video of the whole in-world shopping experience:\n\nFrankly, I wish we had the option to do in-world shopping in Sansar much as we do in Second Life, but I certainly understand why Linden Lab started off with web-based shopping only (it's easier to implement). Having well-stocked in-world stores where the creator can arrange the wares to his or her taste has a certain charm and convenience, and I think it adds a lot to the overall shopping experience. In fact, there are already a few Sansar experiences which are essentially in-world showcases for a particular creator's products, like Alfy's oYo Showroom. We can expect to see more of these types of experiences as Sansar grows.\n\nShopping is a popular pastime in most virtual worlds, and people often put a lot of time and care into how their avatars look, and how they decorate their personal spaces. It will be interesting to watch how the retail landscape evolves in both Sansar and High Fidelity.\n\nAdvertisements"}

Through this hotline, individuals can also obtain counselling, effective immediately, she said.\n\nMacCharles said the province will issue a detailed response to the report in the new year.\n\nThe NDP says it supports the call for a comprehensive review, saying the \"negligence\" uncovered in the review can shake peoples' confidence in getting justice.\n\nProgram shut down in spring\n\nThe hospital initially suspended the program's operations in March after a provincial review.\n\nThe program was shut down in April following questions about the reliability of its hair-testing method.\n\nThe hospital ultimately decided not to reinstate the program after questions and concerns were \"further explored and validated.\""}
{"text": "Interview: Mike Colter, 'Luke Cage is a darker, grittier, more tangible hero'\n\nHenry Northmore\n\n6 March 2015\n\nThe US actor talks Halo: Nightfall and joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Luke Cage\n\nMike Colter is one of the latest actors to enter the world of superheroics. He recently signed on to play Luke Cage in Netflix's series of Marvel Universe TV shows, making his screen debut as Power Man opposite Krysten Ritter in AKA Jessica Jones, before his own headline series. He'll be most familiar to UK viewers for his various roles in The Following, American Horror Story and The Good Wife. However for gamers, he's Jameson Locke in Halo 5 and the star of new videogame movie Halo: Nightfall produced by Ridley Scott.\n\nCould you give us a brief synopsis of Halo: Nightfall?\n\nBasically it's the origin story of Jameson Locke. After a terrorist attack on another planet he ends up working with local authority soldiers to retrieve something that could destroy us all. He's a guy who has been in the military his whole life, essentially special forces. He's not used to working with people who question him. He has to keep on course regardless, the mission must be completed even if it's suicide. He values life but sees the bigger picture.\n\nHow did you get involved with the project?\n\nRidley Scott was part of the production team on The Good Wife. I auditioned on my iPhone and it moved very quickly after that as they thought I was right for the role and pretty soon I was filming in Iceland for two months.\n\nHow was Iceland?\n\nIt was freezing. In between takes, our teeth were chattering. It was supposed to be hot in the film so we were out there with hardly anything on. It's a beautiful country but rained all the time. The film was like a rain magnet.\n\nWere you a Halo fan already?\n\nI was aware of the game before; it's like Coca-Cola, it's a huge brand. I'm always game for creating a new character and I liked the idea of putting something new into the Halo universe.\n\nYou then went onto voice Jameson Locke in the forthcoming Halo 5: Guardians. How did you find that experience?\n\nI felt like a fish out of water. As an actor you're trying to capture the nuances of real life but voice work is almost over-acting. So I found it very hard to judge if I was doing it right. Then when they put it together with the motion capture it was very exciting, almost 3D. Creepy, but exciting.\n\nVideogame movies don't always have the best reputation; did you have any reservations getting involved with Halo: Nightfall?\n\nI had some trepidation but with Ridley Scott involved, at the very least, I felt comfortable there would be a certain standard. I hadn't really done action before and this was an opportunity to bring my brand somewhere else, to go somewhere new as an actor, which was another reason to do it.\n\nAnd do you think it helped you land the role of Luke Cage?\n\nIt couldn't have hurt. And I really wanted the opportunity to do another physical role as there are only so many years you can do this kind of stuff.\n\nWhat can you tell us about the Luke Cage TV series on Netflix?\n\nMarvel actually gives you a special training class in how not to say too much in interviews [laughs]. We're in the middle of shooting AKA Jessica Jones and Luke Cage is a very interesting character who just happens to have super strength and unbreakable skin. He's a neighbourhood hero, very much linked to New York and Jessica Jones. It's all part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe but Luke Cage is a darker, grittier, more tangible character than Iron Man or Thor. He likes to keep things close to his chest, operate on the hush-hush. He has these abilities but he's not sure how and when to use them. He's a very nuanced character.\n\nWhat are you working on next?\n\nLuke Cage will be taking up a lot of my time. Exactly where he's going next I don't know. I'm also working on Agent X with Sharon Stone so I'm juggling them at the moment.\n\nHalo: Nightfall (Anchor Bay) is available on DVD and Blu-Ray from Mon 16 Mar."}

{"text": "2N2/30 Construction Pictures\n\n\nFollow down this page to see how this rig was constructed!\n\n\nThe 5 X 7 inch substrate is partitioned off as shown. In general, each stage is built within the defined spaces.\n\n\nConstruction of this rig started with one of the four sub-modules that were used. This one contains the receive T/R switch, and the input bandpass filter components.\n\n\nThe RF gain potentiometer provides the means of mounting the module to the front-panel.\n\n\nThe first components to go on the main substrate were for the VFO. RIT components were added later.\n\n\nThe main inductor wound on the white T50-7 core is held between a pair of #8 nylon shouldered washers. These keep the coil off of the surface of the PC board substrate, and prevent it from moving around. A nylon 4-40 screw is used to secure the assembly.\n\n\nComponents for the Norton \"noiseless feedback\" receive RF amplifier were then added.\n\n\nNext, an ADE-1 mixer was attached to a substrate header and affixed to the main substrate along with the remaining components for this stage.\n\n\nThe output link from the VFO drives the mixer LO port through a 6 dB attenuator. The IF port of the mixer is terminated with a 3 dB attenuator.\n\n\nPost-mixer amplifier and crystal filter components were added next.\n\n\nNote that the crystal cases are tied together and grounded to the substrate to optimize filter performance.\n\n\nComponents for the IF amplifier were added next.\n\n\nThis stage has about 40 dB of gain, so careful layout is important. Keeping the input and output transformers separated as much as possible improves stability.\n\n\nProduct detector components were then added to the substrate.\n\n\nTo make the product detector function, the LO components were soldered in place.\n\n\nThe crystal case is grounded here also.\n\n\nNext, the audio preamplifier components were added, completing the construction along the front of the substrate.\n\n\nThe diodes shown here were later moved and became part of the receive mute circuitry, where they were designed to be.\n\n\nThese are the receive mute circuitry components.\n\n\nThis circuitry was added between the main amplifier stage to the left and the preamplifier to the right after the transmit strip was finished and operational.\n\n\nOn the left rear side of the substrate, the main audio amplifier components were added.\n\n\nThis same two stage, direct coupled, push-pull amplifier has been used in every 2N2/XX designed to date, and provides over 80 dB of power gain with very low noise.\n\n\nSubstrate with all of the receive components in place except the receive audio mute circuitry.\n\n\nThe receive T/R switch/input filter module is plugged into the RF amplifier.\n\n\nThese are the initial transmit parts. In the middle of the image is the transmit local oscillator, and to its left, the transmit mixer, another ADE-1. The white lead coming in from the top of the image is a piece of teflon coax carrying the VFO signal to the attenuator that connects to the RF port on the mixer.\n\n\nThe components for the transmit Cascode RF amplifier were then added to the substrate. A 51 ohm resistor temporarily terminates this stage for testing.\n\n\nAs with the receive IF amplifier, keeping the input and output transformers separated helps control instability of this high gain stage.\n\n\nNext, components for the transmit driver were added. The 2N2222 transistor will get a suitable heat sink later. The small 50 ohm potentiometer sets the transmit power.\n\n\nAnother sub-module was used for the final amplifier assembly so that it could be replaced easily if the 2SC2166 transistor didn't work out as expected. It worked wonderfully well, and was left intact in the rig as it is shown here.\n\n\nThe temporary heat sink was replaced with a copper strap to carry the heat to the back panel of the case.\n\n\nThe final components to be installed were those for the transmit/receive switch, adjacent to the final amplifier module.\n\n\nCompleted substrate build except the onboard RIT components. Those were installed to the left of the VFO circuitry in the open space that can be seen. The board mounted components went on yet another sub-module.\n\n\nRIT control module mounted to front panel.\n\n\nRIT frequency module mounted to substrate"}

Archaeyopterix Majorus View discussion >>\n\n***Disclaimer: I hate men. Do not read on if you like men.***\n\nOkay, good, now that we got that out of the way, let's address an article titled Okay, good, now that we got that out of the way, let's address an article titled \"Ironic Misandry: Why Feminists Pretending to Hate Men Isn't Funny\" by TIME Digital Operations Editor Sarah Begley. Begley says I can't hate men! That shit isn't funny!!! In fact, it makes me—and all of you—look bad.\n\nAccording to Begley, men-haters (or faux men-haters because damn, it's just a joke), are reversing the feminist successes we (Betty Friedan, Shulamith Firestone, Gloria Steinem, holler!) worked so hard to achieve by confusing people dumb enough to think that misandry is real. [Sidebar: is it real? No.] This misandry, Begley notes, though occasionally cute and funny to those canny enough to understand the layers of inside jokes on Twitter, is dangerous and violent to men.\n\nBut inherent in this word \"misandry\" is hatred. And inherent in phrases like \"ban men\" and \"male tears\" are cruelty and violence. If a man wore a tee shirt that said \"misogynist,\" even if he were a dyed-in-the-wool feminist, wearing it tongue-in-cheek, it would not be funny. It would be misguided.\n\nAn interesting point. But Begley fails to mention that m en have been wearing misogynist t-shirts since there were men on the planet to wear t-shirts. Simply put, every t-shirt a man wears is, in effect, a misogynist t-shirt, whether it is boldly emblazoned with such text or not.\n\nIt's casual fashion choices like this that spur the need for modern women to outwardly express their hatred of men in an ironic or serious manner. In the past, the female specie has rarely had the medium or platform to express distaste against those who have made being a woman feel like a living hell. Maybe if we do it enough and wear enough misandrist barrettes in our hair, someone will start to listen—and ask us, hey, what's up with this misandry thing?\n\nBut Begley ascertains it's not men we're mad it, it's the patriarchy. Okay, sure.\n\nWhat feminists really hate is the patriarchy—the web of institutions that systemically oppress women. And to tear it down, we need as many allies as we can get. Telling half the population that we hate them, even in jest, is not the way to do that. Feminism is still very much engaged in the battle for hearts and minds; appealing to the sense of humor of a very small minority of the population can be a good way to alienate the rest. That's not to say that feminists should water down their true demands and complaints to appeal to broader swaths of the population. Nevertheless, to get folks on your side, you need an an appealing message. Humor can help. But ironic misandry is just bad PR.\n\nWe can hate the patriarchy, but doesn't the patriarchy have to be held up by someone? It's not some omnipotent puff of green smoke that we're mad at. So... who is holding it up? Why do my arms hurt?\n\nThe joke here—as with all good jokes that make a critique of our current culture—is that even if we're kidding (not me: I really hate men), we get a chance to air our grievances to those who may have had no idea of them before. Do women lose allies by alienating the men who aren't in on the wink-wink joke? Maybe. Are those men worth losing? Probably.\n\n[Image via Shutterstock]"}
{"text": "Boehner torn between conservative issues and those with broad appeal\n\nThe House speaker says jobs and the economy are his party's top priority – but many members are focused instead on the Benghazi and IRS scandals, fighting the healthcare overhaul, and most recently on limiting abortion.\n\nKevin Madden, a former Boehner aide and an advisor to former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, says Republicans can't dismiss pressure from the party's base to \"pursue issues that draw distinct contrasts with Democrats,\" such as abortion, because \"values voters\" are an important coalition.\n\nThe actions highlight Boehner's quandary: The Ohio Republican wants to move legislation that broadens the party's appeal, but he must also heed the desire of his conservative rank and file to push their priorities even if, like the abortion bill and healthcare repeal, they are going nowhere in the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats.\n\nOn Tuesday, it was abortion, as Republicans passed one of the most stringent restrictions in a decade. In recent weeks, GOP-run committees held numerous hearings to investigate the Internal Revenue Service's targeting of conservative nonprofits and the attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya. And last month, House Republicans voted unanimously to repeal President Obama's healthcare overhaul, the 37th vote to kill part or all of it.\n\nWASHINGTON — About once a week, like clockwork, House Speaker John A. Boehner insists in a Capitol news conference that jobs and the economy are the \"No. 1 concern\" of his GOP majority. But from week to week, there's often another priority in the House.\n\n\"But the way to win and build a majority electoral coalition is by winning the larger debate over the economy and jobs,\" he said. \"The job of leadership is to convince the rank and file that their best chance to advance the party agenda is by focusing as much time persuading the big middle of the electorate as we do firing up the right flank of the electorate.\"\n\nThe House has passed a few of the initiatives Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) outlined at the start of the year under the banner of \"Making Life Work,\" such as one to revamp worker training programs. On Thursday, Boehner plans to deliver a speech to \"discuss Republican efforts to create jobs, grow our economy, and restore America to a nation of builders.\"\n\nBut the House has garnered far more attention for its focus on bills such as the abortion measure, called the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which passed on a largely party-line vote. Offered by Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), the bill bans abortions about four weeks earlier than the standard set by the U.S. Supreme Court in Roe vs. Wade.\n\nAt a hearing on the measure last week, Franks sparked an uproar when, arguing against exceptions for rape, he said that \"the incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low.\"\n\nDemocrats quickly compared his statement to one made by Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin last year on what he called \"legitimate rape.\" That remark contributed to Akin's defeat and damaged the Republican Party's image nationwide among a crucial swing constituency: moderate women.\n\n\"Many of our Republican colleagues don't seem to have gotten that message,\" Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) said at a news conference, where she was joined by newly elected Democrats who she said had won competitive races because Republicans \"were so callous towards women's healthcare needs.\"\n\nRepublicans tried to undercut that argument in the debate on the House floor. They replaced Franks, who normally would have led the debate, with Rep. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee. And eight of the 11 Republicans who spoke were women, although there are just 19 among the 234 House Republicans.\n\nHouse Republicans defended their detour from the economy. \"Jobs continues to be our No. 1 concern. And while we continue to be focused on this, there are other important issues that we have to deal with,\" Boehner said last week when asked about the issue.\n\nRep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho) said Republicans could \"walk and chew gum at the same time.\"\n\n\"We can protect innocent lives and protect American workers at the same,\" he said.\n\nBut one of the six Republicans who voted against the measure, Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, was reluctant to discuss the issue. \"It's up to the leadership what they want to bring up. My focus is on jobs and the economy,\" he said."}
{"text": "Ahead of their first full series in India since 2009, Sri Lanka have arrived in the country with a bagful of trivia material and scores to settle. It is one thing that the last of their 17 Tests in India came eight years ago, but quite another that Sri Lanka haven't won even one of those dating back to 1982. Only two survivors - Angelo Mathews and Rangana Herath - remain from the side that went down 2-0 in the three-Test series in 2009, but it isn't as if members of the current squad are without scars.\n\nAfter all, it was only around August that Sri Lanka were blanked 9-0 across formats at home by a dominant India side. Between then and now, Sri Lanka had a rollercoaster ride in the UAE, where, after a surprise takedown of Pakistan to sweep the two-match Test series, they lost all the eight limited-overs matches on tour. And so, Sri Lanka have to reset and start from scratch as their young squad, led by Dinesh Chandimal, braces for a bruising examination from an India side that has proved to be near-invincible at home in the recent years. Coach Nic Pothas, though, insisted that the team's culture had changed for the better. More pointedly, he stressed on the need to not be \"infatuated\" with India's strengths and focus on Sri Lanka's game plans instead.\n\n\"The mistake you can make here is come and be infatuated with the Indian side and concentrate too much on them,\" Pothas said on the team's arrival in India. \"We know they are a good side. We only played them a month ago. We have to concentrate on our strengths and jobs, and if we can execute them well it will be a challenging series.\n\n\"There are not too many people who have the joy of playing India back to back. It's always a pleasure to come here and challenge ourselves against a very, very good team. I think where we have changed is the culture within group. When we took on India [in Sri Lanka], we were all pretty new from the support staff to the players involved. We are now a team that pride ourselves in our culture. We defend it and we focus on ourselves.\"\n\nPothas said the thrashing at home from India had proved to be a sound learning experience, and that the team had absorbed those lessons. \"The series against India was a huge learner for us. I also mentioned that if we didn't learn from a very good team then that would have been the biggest error. We did go back to the lessons we learnt - what India does very, very well and the areas we needed to improve.\n\n\"It was a complete different [Test] series against Pakistan. It was 41 degrees and they had lost two legends. That probably made things a little bit easier for us. But the India team is very settled team and all their players are their peak. So it's a completely different challenge, especially here in India. Not many teams have come here in the last few years and won. But what changed for us is internally - the discipline, the culture and how the teams stuck together, the characters that we have picked. As much as the skill and preparation has changed, what we have done internally has changed as well.\"\n\nCaptain Chandimal, playing his first Test series in India, said the team had been working hard at practice. He also said the batting group had plans to counter the spin threat posed by R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja but did not divulge what those were. \"This is my first Test tour to India,\" he said. \"It's a really good challenge for each and every one. As I said, we are doing hard work at practice sessions, especially before coming here, in Bangkok, we did so much hard work at practice. I am sure you can see the new faces - Dasun Shanaka, Dhananjaya de Silva, Roshen Silva, and also Sadeera [Samarawickrama]. I'm sure they will be up for the challenge and do their best in the tournament.\n\n\"Against Pakistan, we played six batters and five bowlers that worked really well, especially in the heat it was never easy to play four bowlers and win a game. If you are playing against India... they have got some really good bowlers, so we need to think about that allrounder position. We will look at the pitch and come up with our plans.\""}

If the device has not been rebooted since the last time the user entered the PIN, all of the data encrypted via data protection can be accessed, whether by an attacker or law enforcement, Zdziarski said.\n\n\"Between this tool and other services, you can get almost the same information you could get from a complete backup.\"\n\n\"Between this tool and other services, you can get almost the same information you could get from a complete backup,\" Zdziarski said in an interview. \"What concerns me the most is that this all bypasses the consumer backup encryption. When you click that button to encrypt the backup, Apple has made a promise that the data that comes off the device will be encrypted.\"\n\nUsing the hidden services that bypass the encrypted backup protection don't require the use of developer mode and many of them have been present in iOS for five years. Zdziarski, who designed many of the initial methods for acquiring forensic data from iOS devices, said there also is a packet capture tool present on every iOS device that has the ability to dump all of the inbound and outbound HTTP data and runs in the background without and notification to the user.\n\n\"It's installed by default and they don't prompt the user. If you're going to start packet sniffing every device that's out there, you really should be prompting the user,\" Zdziarski said.\n\nZdziarski discussed his findings in a talk at the HOPE X conference recently and published the slides and paper, as well. The file_relay service has been in iOS for some time and originally was benign, but Zdziarski said that in recent versions it has turned into a tool that can dump loads of user data on command. The file_relay tool can dump a list of the email and social media accounts, the address book, the user cache folder, which contains screenshots, offline content, copy/paste data, keyboard typing cache and other personal data. The tool can also provide a log of periodic location snapshots from the device.\n\nThere's also a component of the file_relay service called HFSMeta that appeared in iOS 7 and can create a complete metadata image of the device's file system. The data it provides includes metadata on all files, such as timestamps, sizes and dates of creation, all of the apps installed on the device, filenames of all of the email attachments on the device and all of the email accounts configured on the device. It also can provide a copy of the keyboard's autocorrect cache, all of the photos in the user's album and the user's voicemail database.\n\n\"Some of this data shouldn't be on the phone. HFSMeta creates a disk image of everything that's on the phone, not the content but the metadata,\" Zdziarski said. \"There's not even an engineering use for that.\"\n\nSome of the undocumented services and features in iOS map pretty closely to capabilities attributed to some of the NSA's tools, specifically DROPOUTJEEP, which was revealed by documents leaked by Edward Snowden. Zdziarski said that he is not pointing to these services as intentional backdoors for the intelligence community, but he believes there is evidence that the agency may be using them, nonetheless.\n\n\"I'm not saying at all that Apple is working with the NSA,\" he said. \"But at the very least, there's a very strong case to say that the NSA knows about and exploits these capabilities.\""}
{"text": "Oath of the Storm Herald\n\nA paladin who takes an oath as a Storm Herald pledges to serve the destructive, unbiased force of a storm. They protect and serve the wide open skies that manifest the storms. The open skies represent the boundless freedom to succeed in the world, while the Storm represents the awesome power of the natural world in the face of man's hubris. While the Storm can destroy without mercy, it also brings a cleansing renewal. This cycle keeps the world healthy and moving forward.\n\nTenets of a Storm Herald\n\nA paladin who becomes a Storm Herald lives by the following tenets.\n\nThe Storm humbles all. The Storm does not pick sides.\n\nThe Storm cleanses. The Storm may destroy material things, but it brings a cleansing renewal.\n\nThe Storm is implaccable Only the Storm may determine it's path and ferocity.\n\nOath Spells\n\nYou gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.\n\nOath of the Storm Herald Spells\n\nPaladin Level Spells 3rd Featherfall, Thunderwave 5th Shatter, Warding Wind 9th Haste, Thuder Step 13th Elemental Bane, Storm Sphere 17th Control WInds, Steel Wind Strike\n\nCharged Smite\n\nYour Divine Smite ability now deals extra Lightning damage instead of Radiant damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8.\n\nChannel Divinity\n\nWhen you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.\n\nArcing Strike You can use your Channel Divinity to cause lightning to flow through your weapon into your target, arcing to foes around him. When you successfully hit a target with a melee weapon attack, you can use a bonus action to deal additional lightning damage to the target and any number of creatures you can see within 10ft of the target. This lightning damage equals half your paladin level plus your charisma modifier.\n\nStorm Front You can use your Channel Divinity to fly forward with the force of an approaching storm. As an action, you fly forward in a straight line to an unoccupied space you can see. You must move at least 20ft and can move up to 60ft, floating just above the ground. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures within 10ft of your landing spot must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.\n\nAura of Static\n\nBeginning at 7th level, whenever a hostile creature within 10 feet of you takes Lightning or Thunder damage, that creature takes may not take reactions until the start of it's next turn.\n\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\n\nImproved Charged Smite\n\nBy 11th level, whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 Lightning damage. If you also use your Charged Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Charged Smite.\n\nStorm Herald\n\nAt 15th level, you gain proficiency with the Intimidation skill. If you already have proficiency with this skill, you instead double your proficiency bonus for Intimidation checks. In addition, you learn the Thamaturgy cantrip and gain resistance to lightning damage.\n\nEye of the Storm\n\nAt 20th level, you can become the center of a powerful storm. Using your action, you surround yourself with howling winds that last 1 minute. Creatures within 10ft of you are immediately pushed 10ft away from you in a straight line. You may exclude a number of creatures equal to your charisma modifier from this movement. The winds form a a cylinder 60ft wide and 40ft tall centered on you. You gain a fly speed of 60ft. The area inside the cylinder is considered difficult terrain, and ranged attacks that pass through the cylinder have disadvantage. Each creature in the cylinder when it appears or that ends its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 3d6 Bludgeoning damage and be pushed 10ft.\n\nUntil the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from you toward one creature you choose within 60 feet of the center. Make a ranged spell attack. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is in the cylinder. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 lightning damage."}
{"text": "Licensed trade operators in and around Glasgow have united to condemn the decision to stage a Celtic-Rangers (\"Old Firm\") match on Hogmanay, fearing it will make an already difficult night unmanageable and dangerous.\n\nAmong the strongest comments have come from Paul Waterson, chief executive of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association, who wants the match moved to January 2 or 3 and away from the one night of the year when police are already at full stretch and the streets awash with revellers tanked up on supermarket drink carry-outs.\n\nMr Waterson has also questioned why a recent attempt to stage a Munich-style Oktoberfest event in the city centre was knocked back – on the grounds that it would provoke drunken disorder – while an \"Old Firm\" clash has been sanctioned to go ahead.\n\nHe said: \"Does no-one remember Police Scotland's campaign last year during the festive season to reduce the number of domestic incidents – a time when violence is at its highest?\"\n\nThe SLTA has described the Hogmanay decision in forthright terms as \"senseless\" and \"outrageous\".\n\nPolice were reportedly forced to despatch riot vans to control the chaos said to have erupted after an earlier attempt to stage the Oktoberfest event, which had no sectarian football connotation.\n\nA recent match between Rangers and Celtic sparked ugly scenes across Glasgow and into adjoining areas, with drunk supporters screaming sectarian abuse at each other throughout the afternoon.\n\nWhile attention is fixed on Glasgow, Hogmanay flashpoints could also surface in locations as different as Dumbarton and Kirkintilloch – much of west central Scotland could be involved.\n\nThe poisonous historic sectarian rivalry between Rangers and Celtic is feared likely to take on an added edge to an already problematic night.\n\nLicensed trade expert Susan Young, editor of leading trade journal The Dram, said: \"I haven't spoken to a single person who thinks this is a good idea. Hogmanay is supposed to be for families – that's the tradition – and instead we'll have something which has nothing to do with real celebration.\"\n\nShe says that on a practical note it's also \"the one night in the year\" when many men help out, as in organising family parties – and predicts many football supporting spouses will be otherwise occupied.\n\nShe also considers the licensed trade will struggle to contain the backlash from the game, whatever its result, and that even pubs closing early will face an extra security hazard as they strive to maintain their legal obligation by turning away aggressive drunks.\n\nA main worry is that many supporters will be both belligerent and drunk before trying to gain entry to licensed premises – dissuading normal Hogmanay revellers from having a drink \"before the bells\" .\n\nThat in turn could give bars the worst of both worlds, with few regular customers braving late night streets for it to be worthwhile opening, and a deluge of drunk supporters to keep at bay.\n\nThe propensity for domestic violence is feared set to rise dramatically.\n\nAnother worry is that as embattled police try to contain \"Old Firm\" -related drunkenness, abuse and sometimes outright thuggery the chaos could leave the way open for opportunist criminals.\n\nMeanwhile Hogmanay, often said to have lost its traditional family and community spirit, could send out a message about Scotland wildly at odds with its supposed theme of inclusion, generosity and hope.\n\nA night when \"auld acquaintance\" is supposedly celebrated in a roseate familial and communitarian glow of Burnsian bonhomie could instead feature in January 1 news broadcasts as a squalid sectarian bacchanale which puts families at risk, mocking the \"Glasgow Loves Hogmanay\" theme which the city council hoped would move celebrations away from the usual Glasgow-style mass drunkenness.\n\nThe police have said that planning for the unprecedented December 31 \"Old Firm\" fixture is already underway, and that policing it will involve \"a multi-agency partnership approach\".\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins has defended the remarkable decision by maintaining that the time and date were decided after discussions involving police, football authorities and broadcasters.\n\nChief Constable Phil Gormley said: \"There is no ideal time to have the game, but if you put it on New Year's Eve at 12.30pm you reduce the risk of over-consumption of alcohol.\n\n\"You've also got a full transport infrastructure on so that people can get to and from the match.\n\n\"There's a compelling logic around it.\""}
{"text": "A Ugandan court today overturned that country's infamous Anti-Homosexuality Act (AHA) on procedural grounds, because there may not have been a quorum present when it was passed by parliament.\n\nHardly a ringing endorsement of equality and liberty, but a victory nonetheless, and one hard-earned by lawyers from Human Rights Awareness and Promotion Forum (HRAPF) of Uganda, and their partners at UHAI-EASHRI—the local leaders of this battle, incidentally, belying the claim that LGBT equality is some sort of Western conceit.\n\nAnd yet, in the complex context of Uganda, everything about this victory is different from how it appears.\n\nFirst, the major question now is whether the government will appeal the ruling. On the one hand, President Yoweri Museveni has so successfully propagandized against gay people that his government may have no choice but to appeal. Religious leaders in Uganda have depicted the struggle as one between God and Satan.\n\nOn the other hand, this decision could be a blessing in disguise for both Uganda and the United States, which find themselves between various rocks and hard places. Museveni may have underestimated the extent of the Western backlash to the AHA; this could give him an opportunity to back out. Because the ruling was procedural in nature, Museveni could remain supportive of the AHA in principle, but also \"committed to the rule of law\" in practice. And when the AHA is reintroduced in parliament, as it inevitably will be, he can soft-pedal.\n\nBut if this decision is good for President Museveni, it is even better for President Obama. Given its stated policy commitments, and its Democratic base, the Obama administration cannot simply stand by and allow human rights to be trampled. Yet preventing further deterioration in East Africa remains a strategic priority, and the Obama administration recently increased, not decreased, its military aid to Uganda.\n\nEven activists are not united with respect to what to do. While it's popular to call for sanctions, boycotts, closing embassies and the like, many activists have argued that suspending aid (the most popular response) would hurt vulnerable Ugandans, and further reinforce the Gay = Western canard.\n\nThe result of all this has been a grudging, foot-dragging, and ambivalent set of aid conditions finally implemented by the administration after a series of delays. The rhetoric has been harsh, but given the realpolitik of East African foreign policy, the actions have been decidedly mixed.\n\nAnd while the administration did cut $6.4 million in aid to the Inter-Religious Council of Uganda, a virulently anti-gay organization that pushed for the AHA, a recent exposé by The Nation showed that this is the proverbial drop in the bucket. The Children's AIDS Fund, Samaritan's Purse, WorldVision, Heritage Keepers—these are not familiar names to most Americans, but they are some of the evangelical organizations who blend social services with Christian fundamentalist political activism, at home and abroad.\n\nIn short, both Obama and Museveni would be very happy if this whole crisis would just go away.\n\nSo, one might think, would LGBT Ugandans. Yet responses so far have been muted, with some activists calling for restraint. The reason is obvious: backlash.\n\nWe've learned a lot in the last two years about the relationships of law to society when it comes to LGBT equality. In Russia, Uganda, and elsewhere around the world, legal change is the tip of the iceberg. The rest of the iceberg is violence, stigmatization, secondary legal effects, lax policing, and an overall degradation in safety and security.\n\nIn the case of Uganda, records kept by Sexual Minorities Uganda show that violence against LGBT people has increased tenfold since the passage of the AHA. Add in fiery preaching by anti-gay zealots, often funded by American organizations, and you have a volatile brew ready to explode.\n\nActivists worry that this court decision could provide the spark. If the law won't protect Uganda from Satan, people will have to take up arms themselves.\n\nHopefully, cooler heads will prevail. There are supportive African (and African-American) clergy calling for coexistence rather than violence. Maybe the Obama administration, instead of merely backpedaling reactively, could support these voices pro-actively as well. Maybe Museveni could call for a period of national reflection.\n\nOr maybe, things will continue to get worse."}

{"text": "If the F-35B is indeed operational and ready for war—should it not be out there on the front line supporting America's efforts to roll back the Islamic State?\n\nThe United States has deployed some of its most advanced warplanes to fight over Syria and Iraq. But where are the U.S. Marine Corps' newly operational F-35B Lightning II stealth fighters?\n\nDespite having been declared operational at the end of July by Marine Corps. commandant Gen. Joseph Dunford, the stealthy jump-jet is nowhere to be seen in the theatre.\n\nLast year, despite no air threat or even significant air defense systems to contend with, the U.S. Air Force deployed its prized Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptors into the fray . It was the first time those stealthy air superiority fighters had been sent into battle since the jet became operational in 2005. The Raptors—which have excellent sensors—have proven to be useful over Syria even without advanced threats to defeat, Air Force officials including Air Combat Command commander Gen. Hawk Carlisle have stated repeatedly.\n\nRecently, as the Obama Administration announced that the United States will step up its campaign by deploying several dozen special operations forces into Syria, the Air Force also deployed a dozen A-10 Warthogs and some number of Boeing F-15C Eagle air superiority fighters to Turkey. But America's newest \"operational\" strike fighter is nowhere to be seen.\n\nBut why is the F-35B absent? Wouldn't the F-35 with its vaunted array of sensors—which purportedly put even the Raptor's systems to shame—be as useful over Syria as the F-22?\n\nThe answer lies in the fact that despite Marines' proclamations declaring the $400 billion F-35 operational, the jet is not genuinely ready for war.\n\nA memo—which the Project on Government Oversight obtained in September—from the Pentagon's Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) clearly shows that the F-35B had serious reliability issues before Dunford declared initial operational capability (IOC) on July 31. It also highlights the fact that the aircraft were not tested under realistic conditions during the F-35B's \"Operational Test One\" demonstration. The seven F-35Bs onboard Wasp were \"not cleared to carry or employ any ordnance.\" Nor were the jets deployed with the rest of USS Wasp's Air Combat Element (ACE) present.\n\n\"Even though Marine maintainers had rapid, ready access to spare parts from shore and the benefit of the expertise of embarked contractor personnel, aircraft reliability was poor enough that it was difficult for the Marines to keep more than two to three of the six embarked jets in an flyable status on any given day,\" reads the DOT&E memo. \"The challenges will be substantially tougher when the aircraft first deploys operationally, where working mission systems will not be optional, and where maintenance is likely to be more challenging due to the presence of the rest of the ACE.\"\n\nNonetheless, the Marines continue to insist that the F-35B is ready to deploy into a war zone at anytime—which is the definition of being operational . \"VMFA-121 has ten aircraft in the Block 2B configuration with the requisite performance envelope and weapons clearances, to include the training, sustainment capabilities, and infrastructure to deploy to an austere site or a ship. It is capable of conducting Close Air Support, Offensive and Defensive Counter Air, Air Interdiction, Assault Support Escort and Armed Reconnaissance as part of a Marine Air Ground Task Force, or in support of the Joint Force,\" Dunford had said.\n\nIf the F-35B is indeed operational and ready for war—should it not be out there on the front line supporting America's efforts to roll back the Islamic State? Wouldn't its superior sensors be even more of a boon to U.S. forces in the region than the F-22's?\n\nSetting aside the sustainment costs—the American taxpayer is on the hook for nearly $400 billion just to buy the Pentagon's 2,443 F-35s and we deserve a return on that investment. As former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld famously said, \"As you know, you go to war with the Army you have. They're not the Army you might want or wish to have at a later time.\" It is time we deployed the F-35B we have. If the jet is ready for war as the Marines claim— then let's see what it can do."}

{"text": "BALTIMORE — Michael Pineda said he's done using pine tar. But Orioles manager Buck Showalter said he has no problem with the Yankees pitcher or anyone else slapping on the sticky stuff, even though it's against the rules.\n\n\"No,\" Showalter said when asked if he'll watch whether Pineda uses it Wednesday. \"Because our guy's going to have it loaded down, too.\"\n\nShowalter was joking — I think — about righty Chris Tilliman, who's slated to start against the Yankees at Camden Yards.\n\nBut Showalter's points were clear:\n\nPitchers should be allowed to use substances that aid grip.\n\nManagers who complain about other pitchers' use of substances on the mound probably have pitchers who use them, too.\n\nAnd Japanese baseballs are way better than the ones MLB uses because they're stickier.\n\n\"I'm hoping something will be done,\" Showalter said about MLB Rule No. 8:02 meant to stop pitchers from using substances on the mound. \"I understand why (pitchers use substances). And, for certain guys, I hope they've got a little bit. I hope they don't hit anybody.\"\n\nPineda was ejected in the second inning of a game in Boston April 23 when Red Sox manager John Farrell complained about a streak on Pineda's neck. An umpire checked the streak, dabbing it with his finger. It was pine tar. Pineda was gone and, the next day, he was suspended 10 games.\n\nPineda had a history of using substances on the mound. TV cameras caught him two weeks earlier using pine tar, but he washed it off the next inning. Other photos have shown him with a brown substance on his hand during a start in Toronto and in spring training.\n\nPineda hasn't pitched since the ejection. During the ban, he strained a shoulder muscle, which kept him on the disabled list from May 6 to Wednesday.\n\nOn Monday, Pineda said he learned from his mistake of using pine tar and that he'd never use it again.\n\nBut, if he did, Showalter would be fine with it, the manager said.\n\n\"Am I going to be looking for it? I'm hoping (Pineda's) got a little bit in the right place,\" Showalter said. He later added: \"These baseballs, when it's cool and windy, you try to grip them. Especially early in the year, in the first month, in February, when it's cool and wet. I think it's something we've got to look into.\"\n\nBaseballs that enter major-league games have already been rubbed down with dirt to increase grip. Showalter alleged that some teams rub them down more than others. He also said that sometimes, when games go long, there aren't enough rubbed-down baseballs, and pitchers are using slicker balls than what they started with.\n\nShowalter said that would cause a firestorm in another sport, particularly football, and he referenced Baltimore Ravens head coach Jim Harbaugh.\n\n\"Could you imagine when coach Harbaugh's team is playing with a (different)-colored ball from than the other team?\" Showalter said.\n\nThe Orioles manager also said many pitchers throughout the game use substances and it's no secret.\n\n\"But be careful about complaining about somebody else,\" he said. \"You might want to look in your own back yard. I know, we'r all talking about it. I've got a pretty good idea of who's doing it and who isn't. It's not always pine tar … And obviously you're pretty obvious about it. I hope (Pineda) can grip a baseball (Wednesday), especially how hard he throws. I hope he knows where it's going, but not too much.\"\n\nShowalter added that he has about 10 Japanese baseballs in his office.\n\n\"They have a pre-tackiness applied to them,\" the manager said. \"So they come out, you take them out of the wrapper, give it to the pitcher and play with them. You don't have to rub them up. They have a certain tackiness to them. It's one of the biggest adjustments people talk about with the size of balls and players. When Asian players come over, it's not the size of the baseball that you have to make adjustments, it's that you can't grip them. That's what you need to talk about.\""}

You can do anything.\"\n\n\"Whatever you want,\" the interviewer says.\n\n\"Grab 'em by the pussy, you can do anything,\" Trump replies.\"\n\nIt's the way Mr Trump reveals that he sees women as a piece of sexual meat, something he wants, grabs, discards that is so damning.\n\nSurveys (US government and UN) suggest one in five American women are the victim of rape or attempted rape and a staggering 83% of girls suffer sexual harassment at school.\n\nMr Trump is not guilty of either of those but his language is exactly the kind of language that encourages men and boys to feel it's okay to abuse women.\n\nThere is a violence in the phrases \"grab 'em by the pussy\" and \"you can do anything\" that any victim of abuse would recognise and that most women would find sickening.\n\nTo dismiss the tape as mere \"locker room banter\" and imply that the people who are offended are making an unnecessary fuss, or to say, as he did in his bizarre overnight apology tape, that this is just a distraction, compounds his problem.\n\nImage copyright European photopress agency Image caption Trump has offended many groups of people before\n\nBut this tape doesn't just offend women, judging from the reaction in the Republican party - it has offended a lot of men too. Whether those men will now withdraw their endorsements of him is yet to be seen.\n\nMr Trump has denigrated people before. His comments about Muslims and Mexicans have arguably been equally grotesque and many, including some Republicans, have suggested they disqualified him for the presidency too.\n\nNot everyone in America, however, knows a Muslim or a Mexican. Most people, and most voters, do have wives, mothers, sisters or daughters and that's why this tape touches a nerve, with both sexes, in a way his previous remarks haven't.\n\nPowerful men using their position to get sex is nothing new, even in the White House. JFK and Bill Clinton paved that path.\n\nToday some of Trump's supporters are making the case that anyone who voted for Bill Clinton has no right to be offended by Donald Trump.\n\nImage copyright AP Image caption Will the subject of Bill Clinton's infidelities now come up at Sunday's debate?\n\nI've been critical of Mr Clinton's treatment of women, and of Mrs Clinton's role in shielding him, but those supporters are missing the point.\n\nIn 2016, don't we all want more from our leaders than another man who feels getting sex from whoever they want, whenever they want is simply one of the perks of power? For my two daughters, I know I do.\n\nHow Mr Trump manages the fallout from this isn't clear. He doesn't like apologising. Indeed, he has bragged about never doing so.\n\nYet overnight he did release a video statement in which he said: \"I said it, I was wrong, and I apologise.\"\n\nIn the tape he then goes on to attack both Clintons' records. So on Sunday night, when he debates with Hillary Clinton for the second time, will he raise the issue of Bill Clinton's affairs and Hillary's role in discrediting the women involved, or will he keep quiet about sex altogether?\n\nIn the past Mr Trump has not been able to resist lashing out when he's under attack. So, whatever his advisers may caution, I suspect we will see more of that in St Louis on Sunday night."}
{"text": "Microsoft's Kinect motion-sensing system is making its way into hardcore games, but not in the way everyone thought. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, one of the hottest-selling games from the fall, will exploit the voice-recognition feature in Kinect so that you can more easily navigate through the game's complex interface. And you can cast spells more easily by shouting them.\n\nThe Kinect retrofit is an interesting way to keep fans occupied with the game, and it is an interesting experiment with how games could be built in the future, with voice recognition designed into them from the very start. Pete Hines, vice president of marketing and communications at game publisher Bethesda Softworks, showed off the interface in an interview with GamesBeat last week.\n\nThe Kinect add-on will be part of a free update to the Xbox 360 version of the game. The update is already live. It should be a new source of entertainment for the 10-million-plus people who bought the game. On average, gamers are playing Skyrim for 80 to 85 hours. Anything that makes it easier to play, given those long hours, would be welcome for hardcore fans.\n\n\"The point is to make it easier to navigate through the game,\" Hines said.\n\nIt's notable that Bethesda chose not to use gesture recognition, which is the main feature of Kinect. But judging from most other titles, developers have found that Kinect's gestures aren't accurate enough to use reliably in hardcore games. But voice recognition, which is aided by the three microphones included in the Kinect 3D camera, works well enough.\n\nBioWare, a division of Electronic Arts, implemented Kinect voice commands in Mass Effect 3. That helped with the game play, as it allowed you to issue orders to two companions using voice commands, rather than stopping the action, scrolling through a command wheel, and issuing commands with a controller. When things were hot and heavy, you could shout a command that could save your bacon.\n\nThe work on Kinect started a few months ago, after Skyrim was already on sale. Game studio head Todd Howard directed the team to create anything they wanted for a week, as long as they implemented it inside the world of Skyrim. A Bethesda developer, Ricky Gonzalez, decided to make voice recognition work in the game. He got the bare bones done and then Bethesda decided it was interesting enough to put a small team to work on it. Over the last couple of months, they created the full set of features. Now you can issue around 200 different voice commands in the game.\n\nThe simple commands involve navigating through the complex user interface. You can say \"quick map\" and Kinect will bring up the map of Skyrim. If you say, \"White Run,\" it will take you to that town. All of the town names are now integrated into the system so that Kinect will recognize them. You can go into your journal and then ask where your quest destination is. You can navigate through the skill menu quickly just by saying the name of a skill. You can call up various spells after you say, \"quick magic.\"\n\nYou can say, \"assign sword\" to equip a weapon. Within a minute, you can pretty much change your weaponry. You can say commands that allow you to dual wield or switch weapons during the middle of combat. The highlight of the system is using Kinect to implement the voice-powered spells, known as Dragon Shouts, in the game. Normally, you would have to stop the action and issue a command with the controller. But with Kinect, you simply shout the command, such as \"unrelenting force,\" and it executes it. Many of those shouts require you to select options from a menu, so they can take three button-pushes to execute normally. With Kinect, you can issue the shout in far less time using your voice.\n\nAnother cool feature is that it can automate some processes. For instance, when you loot a corpse, you can set the loot limit to 50 points. That means you will only pick up items from the corpse that have a higher value.\n\nIt doesn't always work. Hines had to repeat himself a number of times during the demo. If you position high-end speakers near the Kinect module, your voice may be drowned out by the sound of the game. For instance, if it is raining in the game, it's pretty hard for Kinect to filter out the noise and recognize your commands.\n\nBut adding Kinect can make it faster to play the game and get to the fun, so you don't have to wrestle with the user interface."}
{"text": "There was a moment in my third game of Total War: Arena that I fell in love. At the start of the game one of our players had drawn a big, big arrow down the centre. Then one had drawn an elaborate, unusually hairy dong down the map screen, the tip pointing right up the enemy's flank. It was a sophisticated plan, I think. Bait the red team into overextending, then cut their archers down before closing the escape.\n\nSign up for Total War: Arena right now!\n\nTurns out, cock-based strategies really work.\n\nThe reds fell into our trap. Pikemen held the forest while light infantry charged around the side. It was merciless. A wave of remorseless militia clad in white, stabbing and sticking and stabbing again.\n\n\"LOL,\" said our tactically astute leader in team-chat. \"WE F*****D THJEM RIGHT UP.\"\n\n\"Yes. Yes we did.\"\n\nI, too, rolled my eyes when I first heard about Total War: Arena. Did we really need a Total War flavoured MOBA? It turns out, we didn't. Arena isn't another MOBA. It's closer to World of Tanks, but with legs.\n\nIt has more players for a start: battles are 10v10. It has more units, too: everyone is responsible for three little troupes of historical pikemen, archers or cavalry. It doesn't do in-game levelling: all your units are upgraded between matches.\n\nGames are fast paced: units sprint everywhere and the maps are small enough to encourage quick engagements. But that doesn't make them any less tactical: it's clear that even a simple plan, if players stick to it, will usually succeed. The skills you've built in Total War work: picking flanks, charging and retreating, and the rock/paper/scissors relationships between infantry, cavalry and archers are in place. The game's bigger and more impressive somehow – with each unit being micromanaged there's just way more going on.\n\nThe maps are intricate and quite lovely: there are mountain passes to be captured and held, plains to charge over and rivers to ford or hold. They tell a story: in the centre of the newly launched Germania there's a ruined and still smouldering central forest, the trees reduced to burning stumps.\n\nIt's technically impressive too. Even in the heat of the largest battles, I didn't see a hint of slowdown. Total War has always been a system hog, yet here, you can throw hundreds of units at each-other and the engine just shrugs off the challenge.\n\nIf I have a criticism, it is that the between match interface is dramatically overcomplicated. There are three types of currency, and part of your upgrade strategy is deciding how and what to convert. Units are upgraded via a very, very detailed tech tree, but it's not clear how you progress upwards, or whether you should start with a different commander and set of units. Each unit can earn special abilities, like shield blocks or morale boosts that are activated on cool-down, which feels maybe a little videogamey, but I can forgive it. Changing the course of an engagement battle with a well-timed shield bash, and your team-mate charging a group of cavalry into the downed enemy is quite quite the thing.\n\nLast little anecdote. We'd been caught in a difficult situation; the bulk of our army was engaged on the flanks while the enemy was charging forward. We'd left a few hoplites to hold the base, but they were massively outnumbered.\n\nUsually, this would feel like game over. In a game with ten players, it would surely dissolve into chaos and chat room abuse.\n\nBut as one, without anyone saying a word, our team fell back to some natural chokepoints, sacrificing a few lost causes in the hope of just holding the line. It worked: redeploying just across a riverbed gave our archers cover and left the enemy bogged down. I made an actual fist-pump and everything.\n\nI really, really like Total War: Arena. I think it's the smartest thing Creative Assembly have made in a long, long time. I can see myself playing it well into the future.\n\nPlay Total War: Arena for free, now.\n\nTotal War: Arena is in beta. You can sign up for a chance to play it at the Arena site."}

Think about that.\n\nContinue Reading Below Advertisement\n\nSo what can you do?\n\nHaha, wouldn't it be amazing if I actually had a one-sentence cure for the plague of the industrialized world? The closest I could offer would be \"Have you tried just not giving a shit?\" but that won't do. You have to give a certain number of shits just to stay alive. For every truly carefree person I know, there's a nervous friend or family member who has to keep a \"bail out my carefree friend\" fund on hand for the next time that free spirit gets an eviction notice.\n\nNo, my plan is slightly more detailed, in that it has two parts instead of just the one:\n\n1. Recognize that your attention is a limited resource which must be spent carefully ... and that pushing yourself too hard can put you in the fucking ground.\n\n2. Realize that a lot of the things clamoring for your attention are the equivalent of inbox spam.\n\nThat is, it's junk mail sent by other people to trick you into feeling anxious in a way that will indirectly benefit them. The key is learning to filter it.\n\nSo if anxiety is intended to be a motivator for positive action, then you must only spend it on things that you can actually affect with action. Otherwise, it's spam. Examples:\n\nContinue Reading Below Advertisement\n\n-- You are made to feel ashamed about a personal attribute you have no control over (height, facial features, penis girth, race, gender, sexuality).\n\n-- You are upset because a person you are very nice to doesn't enjoy your company (you have no power over others' response to you).\n\n-- You feel a jolt of anger in your gut every time a religious/political/cultural group you find repulsive shows up in your news feed, upsetting you with their mere existence.\n\nNow, if the thing you are having anxiety about is something you can affect with action but is someone else's agenda, it's also spam. Examples:\n\n-- Someone is trying to shame you over your job/partner/body, even though you yourself are happy with them.\n\n-- Someone is trying to shame you for the harmless hobbies you enjoy.\n\n-- Someone is trying to shame you because your life doesn't look exactly like theirs.\n\nYou must learn to use the same technique taught in rehab and anger management classes: You have to stop, step outside of the emotion, and say, \"I am feeling anxiety about this. Should I?\"\n\nContinue Reading Below Advertisement\n\nIf the answer is no, you can now deploy that psychological trump card known as Not Giving A Shit.\n\nIt's not easy. It's a skill you'll have to practice for the rest of your life. Still, recognizing the need to do it is a massive step, since most of us accept anxiety as the background noise of everyday life (to the point where we actually get confused when it's not there, the way city folk get freaked out by natural silence when they try to go camping). This technique requires you to regard your own peace of mind as a precious resource that is under continuous assault, and to reflexively defend it. A sort of martial art of the mind which involves strategically deploying or withholding your shit-giving as needed. I call it Noshitsu.\n\nBut be warned: Your enemies have been honing their techniques for a very long time. Still, with vigilance and repetition, I know for a fact that you, too, can become a Noshitsu master.

{"text": "A 48-year-old terminal cancer patient was rushed to the hospital from an Iowa courthouse Monday during his trial over felony charges for growing marijuana he uses as a treatment for his rare condition.\n\nBrian Wellner of Iowa's Quad-City Times' first reported that paramedics took Benton Mackenzie, who was expected to take the stand in his trial in Scott County District Court on Monday, from the courtroom to a local hospital after he complained of extreme pain and hallucinations related to his angiosarcoma, a rare and aggressive form of cancer of the blood vessels which has produced large lesions on Mackenzie's skin.\n\nDespite Mackenzie's deteriorating condition, his trial is expected to be completed Friday, Linda Bowman, the judicial trial court supervisor at the Scott County Clerk's Office, told The Huffington Post. If Mackenzie is found guilty, he faces at least three years in prison -- a punishment that he's said equates to a death sentence.\n\n\"If I'm found guilty at all, I'm a dead man,\" Mackenzie told Quad-City in May.\n\nWARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGE APPEARS BELOW, READER DISCRETION IS ADVISED.\n\n\nIowa Gov. Terry Branstad (R) signed a limited measure into law in May that legalizes the use of CBD, or cannabidiol, a non-psychoactive compound found in cannabis and used in the treatment of seizures. However, the state has not legalized the broader use of medical marijuana, as 23 states have done. According to FreeBenton.org, a website documenting Mackenzie's case, Mackenzie has never cultivated cannabis to sell or distribute, but instead has used the plants for personal medical purposes to make the CBD oil and treat his cancerous tumors.\n\nIowa's CBD law protects use of the same marijuana-derived oil that Mackenzie uses, but the law's narrow focus on treatment of only \"intractable epilepsy\" does not apply to or legally protect Mackenzie.\n\nDistrict Court Judge Henry Latham ruled in May that Mackenzie is barred from using his condition as a defense in court during his trial as a reason for why he was growing marijuana, the Associated Press reported.\n\n\"I'm not allowed to give proof why I was using,\" Mackenzie told the Quad-City Times. \"Now, there is no fair trial.\"\n\nPhotos documenting Mackenzie's case and the growth of the cancerous lesions have been posted to the \"Free Benton Mackenzie\" Facebook page, a community forum dedicated to Mackenzie's case.\n\nOne of the most recent photos, from July 4, appears below:\n\nIn 2013, Mackenzie was arrested after local authorities seized 71 marijuana plants during a raid of his parents' home in Long Grove, Iowa. Marijuana in any form is illegal at the federal level, and Iowa lacks any broad legal medical marijuana framework.\n\nMackenzie, his wife Loretta, his son Cody (21) and his parents Charles and Dorothy (76 and 75, respectively) were all charged with various counts, from felonies to misdemeanors -- including hosting a drug house and conspiracy to grow and sell marijuana, the Washington Times reported. The trial for Mackenzie, his wife and their son began in early July.\n\nIowa's new CBD oil law isn't the state's first encounter with the prospects of legalizing marijuana for medical use. Back in 2010, the Iowa Board of Pharmacy unanimously recommended that the state legislature legalize the use of medical marijuana. Earlier this year, after several failed attempts to legalize the drug, the board's chairman said during a hearing that the organization lacks the authority to establish a medical marijuana program in the state, but sympathizes with the Iowa voters seeking legalization. State lawmakers need to make a decision on the matter, the chairman said.\n\nMeanwhile, Iowa voters overwhelmingly support medical marijuana -- 81 percent are in favor of legalization, according to a recent poll.\n\nIn an op-ed over the weekend, the Des Moines Register editorial board weighed in on both the limited CBD oil law and the Mackenzie case.\n\n\"The change in law benefits only a small group of Iowans with the most organized lobbying efforts,\" the editorial board wrote. \"Other sick Iowans should have legal access to marijuana extracts, too. These include people with painful and debilitating conditions like cancer, spinal cord injuries and severe arthritis, who may benefit from the drug. But if these people obtain cannabis oil, they will still be considered criminals in this state.\"\n\nLater on Monday, Wellner tweeted an update on Mackenzie:"}
{"text": "It is the stuff of spy novels, but a new investigation published Monday reveals that the U.S. Pentagon for years funneled millions to a charity organization employing it to serve as the front group for global espionage—very real revelations that experts warn could have dangerous implications for aid workers worldwide.\n\nAfter a months-long investigation, The Intercept's Matthew Cole, with help from Margot Williams and Lee Fang, exposes the reach of a highly-classified Department of Defense program, which ran from December 2004 to 2013.\n\nThe program was reportedly the \"brainchild\" of Lt. Gen. William \"Jerry\" Boykin, an evangelical Christian who served under President George W. Bush. After the 9/11 attacks, Boykin was charged with expanding the intelligence gathering arm of the DoD and, \"taking a page from the CIA's playbook,\" began tapping NGOs to use as a cover for Pentagon espionage operations.\n\nThe exposé highlights one group, the Colorado Springs-based Christian organization Humanitarian International Services Group, or HISG, whose founder, Kay Hiramine, had for years been on the Pentagon payroll and whose organization reportedly had millions funneled to it via a \"complex web\" of private trusts and nonprofits.\n\nThe Pentagon reportedly employed HISG, which provided disaster relief and supplies to poor and war-torn countries, to infiltrate North Korea to gain access and information regarding its nuclear program—relying on the organization's \"unwitting\" employees, volunteers, and contacts to do so.\n\nThe Intercept reports:\n\nThe Pentagon tasked Hiramine with gathering the intelligence it needed inside North Korea, and Hiramine would in turn utilize HISG's access to the country to complete the assignments, according to two former military officials with knowledge of the effort. Hiramine, in his role as CEO of HISG, tapped Christian missionaries, aid workers, and Chinese smugglers to move equipment into and around North Korea — none of whom had any idea that they were part of a secret Pentagon operation. ... Because American intelligence has so few assets inside North Korea, much of Hiramine's task was to find transportation routes to move military equipment — and potentially clandestine operatives — in and around the country. The Pentagon would eventually move sensors and small radio beacons through Hiramine's transportation network, according to another former military official. Much of what Hiramine was doing was what the military refers to as \"operational preparation of the environment,\" or OPE, a category that encompasses clandestine intelligence gathering and prepositioning equipment inside a country for future conflicts.\n\nIn one early \"test run,\" an HISG shipment of charity clothing included a secret cache of Bibles in order to see if supplies could get into the country without being discovered.\n\nAs Cole notes, HISG \"was one of several NGOs used by the Pentagon in this way. Some, like HISG, already existed as fledgling organizations, while others were created from scratch by the Pentagon.\"\n\nThe investigation's findings, \"that the Pentagon used an NGO and unwitting humanitarian volunteers for intelligence gathering,\" constitutes a major transgression and threatens the safety and work of aid organizations worldwide.\n\nSam Worthington, president of InterAction, an association of nearly 200 American NGOs, told the reporters that such activity \"violates international principles\" and places legitimate aid and development workers at great risk.\n\n\"It is unacceptable that the Pentagon or any other U.S. agency use nonprofits for intelligence gathering,\" Worthington said. \"It is a violation of the basic trust between the U.S. government and its civic sector.\"\n\nIndeed, a CIA-directed mission in 2011 which employed a Pakistani doctor to gather DNA samples of Osama bin Laden's presumed family members, under the guise of a hepatitis vaccination program, has resulted in numerous attacks on \"legitimate\" medical groups.\n\nFurther, as noted by Sarah Knuckey, Columbia Law professor and director of the school's Human Rights Clinic, these findings also give \"rhetorical ammo\" to repressive governments seeking to restrict NGO activities within their borders.\n\nHISG was reportedly shuttered in 2013 after Adm. William McRaven shut down the North Korean spying operation the year before. It's \"unclear\" if President Obama was ever briefed on the program, The Intercept notes, and the White House declined to comment.\n\nThe Intercept investigation relied on interviews with more than a dozen current and former military and intelligence officials, humanitarian aid workers, missionaries, U.S. officials, as well as former HISG staffers. The Pentagon provided no comment on HISG or the espionage operations in North Korea."}
{"text": "Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) who has worked on issues related to NSA data gathering, has an unlikely theory as to why so many senior officials across multiple parts of the government are supportive of the NSA's activities despite a majority of Americans being against the practice. In a recent ACLU blog post, Stanley brought up the possibility that the NSA uses information gathered on public officials to strong-arm their political trajectories in favor of the agency. He writes:\n\n\"Everyone has dark suspicions about their political opponents from time to time, and Americans are highly distrustful of government in general. When there is any opening at all for members of the public to suspect that officials from the legislative and judicial branches could be vulnerable to leverage from secretive agencies within the executive branch — and when those officials can even suspect they might be subject to leverage — that is a serious problem for our democracy.\"\n\nAccording to former NSA analyst and Bush-era whistleblower Russ Tice, the NSA has been using eavesdropping activities to gather intelligence on powerful people in the U.S. government for years. This year he even claimed that the NSA ordered wiretapping on President Barack Obama when he was a candidate for Senate. Tice, in an interview for the website of FBI whistleblower Sibel Edmonds, said:\n\n\"They went after – and I know this because I had my hands literally on the paperwork for these sort of things–they went after high-ranking military officers; they went after members of Congress, both Senate and the House, especially on the intelligence committees and on the armed services committees and some of the–and judicial.\n\nBut they went after other ones, too. They went after lawyers and law firms. All kinds of–heaps of lawyers and law firms. They went after judges. One of the judges is now sitting on the Supreme Court that I had his wiretap information in my hand. Two are former FISA court judges. They went after State Department officials. They went after people in the executive service that were part of the White House – their own people. They went after antiwar groups. They went after U.S. international–U.S. companies that that do international business, you know, business around the world. They went after U.S. banking firms and financial firms that do international business. They went after NGOs that – like the Red Cross, people like that that go overseas and do humanitarian work. They went after a few antiwar civil rights groups.\n\nSo, you know, don't tell me that there's no abuse, because I've had this stuff in my hand and looked at it. And in some cases, I literally was involved in the technology that was going after this stuff.\"\n\nTice would later in the interview go on to make that enormous claim that the NSA ordered the wiretapping of then \"wannabe senator from Illinois,\" Barack Obama, and that he held the NSA order in his own hands at one point.\n\nWhy would it matter, if proven true, that President Obama had been wiretapped? According to retired CIA analyst and briefer to numerous presidents Ray McGovern, the reason Obama has largely changed his stance on the NSA's intelligence gathering practices from when he was a candidate for president, and why he has exponentially ramped up the extrajudicial killing of terror suspects by CIA drones, is because he is at the whim of the intelligence apparatus for things they might have uncovered about his past. On a radio show McGovern said:\n\n\"Which leads to the question, why would [Obama] do all these things? Why would he be afraid for example, to take the drones away from the CIA? Well, I've come to the conclusion that he's afraid. Number one, he's afraid of what happened to Martin Luther King Jr. And I know from a good friend who was there when it happened, that at a small dinner with progressive supporters – after these progressive supporters were banging on Obama before the election, 'Why don't you do the things we thought you stood for?' Obama turned sharply and said, 'Don't you remember what happened to Martin Luther King Jr.?' That's a quote, and that's a very revealing quote.\"\n\nIs the NSA using wiretapping and other unconventional data gathering methods to gather sensitive private information on government officials to blackmail them into maintaining their support? It's an unconvincing assertion at best. The possibility, however, that blackmail a-la-J. Edgar Hoover goes on should be considered in the important debate over the future of wiretapping and data collection here in America."}

The photos showed his ex-girlfriend \"nude in certain positions and clearly showing her breasts and genitalia.\"\n\nUsmanov, a credit controller for a shipping company, reportedly told police:\n\n\"I put the photos up because she hurt me and it was the only thing [I had] to hurt her.\"\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald reported that Usmanov emailed his girlfriend after he posted the photos to Facebook, saying: \"Some of your photos are now on Facebook.\" The woman, who was not identified, pleaded with Usmanov to take down the photos. When he refused, she called the police.\n\nDeputy-Chief Magistrate, Jane Mottley, said: \"New-age technology through Facebook gives instant access to the world. Facebook as a social networking site has limited boundaries. Incalculable damage can be done to a person's reputation by the irresponsible posting of information through that medium. With its popularity and potential for real harm, there is a genuine need to ensure the use of this medium to commit offenses of this type is deterred.\"\n\nIn 2010, the Dominion Post reported on New Zealand man Joshua Simon Ashby, 20, who was sentenced to four months in jail for posting a naked photo of his ex-girlfriend on Facebook.\n\nHis act was described as one of \"irresponsible drunken rage\" by presiding judge, who also said: \"Technology can't be used in this way. You would do incalculable damage to someone's reputation.\"\n\nUsmanov's ex-girlfriend, who Fairfax chose not to identify, had ended their relationship and moved out of their shared home less than three months before he posted the photos.\n\nFairfax cited Australian privacy experts as saying the case has exposed the ''tip of the iceberg'' of online offenses that were rarely punished.\n\nMore from GlobalPost: Facebook removal of breastfeeding images angers Aussie mums\n\nDavid Vaile, executive director of the cyberspace law and policy center at the University of New South Wales, said online harassment was not taken as seriously as physical offenses.\n\n''There are very few convictions under harassment and indecent publication, he told Fairfax. \"It's not treated as the same way as, say, breaking into a bank website. There is more police support for criminal damage. In this case, he didn't slash her tires in an act of revenge. He slashed her reputation.''\n\nThe legality or otherwise of posting nude photos of others without their permission in the US is unclear, though a Google search reveals several web forums devoted to the topic, including this one.\n\nIn sentencing Usmanov, Mottley reportedly said: \"New-age technology through Facebook gives instant access to the world.

With its popularity and potential for real harm, there is a genuine need to ensure the use of this medium to commit offenses of this type is deterred.\n\n''The harm to the victim is not difficult to contemplate: embarrassment, humiliation and anxiety at not only the viewing of the images by persons who are known to her but also the prospect of viewing by those who are not. It can only be a matter for speculation as to who else may have seen the images, and whether those images have been stored in such a manner which, at a time the complainant least expects, they will again be available for viewing, circulation or distribution.''\n\nUsmanov's lawyer, Maggie Sten, had argued his was not a ''serious offense,'' to which Mottley fired back: ''What could be more serious than publishing nude photographs of a woman on the internet, what could be more serious?''\n\nShe added: ''It's one thing to publish an article in print form with limited circulation. That may affect the objective seriousness of the offense but once it goes on the worldwide web via Facebook it effectively means it's open to anyone who has some link in any way, however remotely.''\n\nMore from GlobalPost: Meet the people behind Turkey's 'miracle'"}

That's the conclusion of a new report from NASA's Office of Inspector General.\n\nThe two inaugural missions are part of NASA's long-term plan of sending people to Mars in the 2030s. They'll involve two key pieces of hardware the space agency is developing: a giant rocket called the Space Launch System and a crew capsule called the Orion. The first SLS flight, scheduled for November 2018, will launch an empty Orion capsule into orbit around the Moon. The second flight, slated for no earlier than 2021, will launch a crew of four on an eight-day journey, also around the Moon.\n\nThe programs supporting these first couple of flights are not being funded at recommended levels\n\nRight now, NASA is also working on all of the hardware on the ground that is meant to support launches of these vehicles. That includes building a new mobile launch platform that the SLS will take off from, and making modifications to certain buildings at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nBut the OIG report points out that all of the programs supporting these first couple of flights are not being funded at recommended levels. That means that if an issues pops up, there isn't enough money to cover for it. Meanwhile, the development of a few other key systems, such as the software needed for the flights, are behind schedule. All of these issues combined make it pretty unlikely that the first flights of SLS will happen when NASA says they will, the report argues.\n\nAnother problem is that the overall plan for these launches could change. NASA has said it might do away with the uncrewed SLS mission, and just go with the crewed one first. The agency is studying what it'd take to pull this off, and such a move would seemingly delay the first SLS flight until 2019 at the earliest. However, this change hasn't be confirmed just yet, and so the original two-flight plan still stands for now.\n\nThe report also looked at the larger NASA Mars mission beyond these first two flights, and criticized the space agency for not having much of a plan. A couple of weeks ago, NASA's Bill Gerstenmaier, the associate administrator for human exploration and operations, gave a rough outline of the missions NASA hoped to do in preparation for a crewed Mars mission. The timeline involved launching a number of habitats and modules into an area around the Moon. These modules will be put together to create what NASA is calling the Deep Space Gateway — a place for astronauts to visit and train. Once that station is built, NASA will launch the Deep Space Transport vehicle — the spacecraft that will actually take people to the vicinity of Mars.\n\nThe cost of pulling off a comprehensive human mission to Mars at NASA is could be astronomical\n\nThough that outline represents the first major details of the Mars mission NASA has announced in a while, it still doesn't specify when these vehicles will be made and how much they'll cost. And what about the habitats for astronauts to live on the Red Planet, or the vehicles needed to transport them to and from the planet's surface? Those details are missing too, the OIG reports says. Given all this uncertainty, the OIG recommends that NASA come up with more rigorous schedules, establish objectives for the things it needs to accomplish, and figure out better cost estimates for what this whole thing will take.\n\nBecause the cost of pulling off a comprehensive human mission to Mars at NASA is could be astronomical — so coming up with better budget estimates is crucial. Up until this point, NASA has spent more than $15 billion on its Mars efforts, but the OIG says that everything associated with the human exploration of Mars will exceed a cost of $210 billion by 2033. For that reason, the OIG recommends that the space agency figure out ways to save money on its Mars mission — either by partnering with other government space agencies or the private space industry.\n\nThis isn't the first time that NASA's been criticized for lacking a clear plan regarding its Mars initiatives, and it's not even the first time that the OIG and other advisory committees have cast doubts on the schedule for the first launches of the SLS. And 2018 is fast approaching too, so we'll soon find out if all this forecasting of delays turns out to be true."}
{"text": "And Kentucky's eight electoral votes go to ...\n\nOkay, it's far too early for that, but in a hypothetical matchup in the 2016 presidential race between U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Paul would narrowly carry the Bluegrass State, according to a new poll.\n\nThe Bluegrass Poll, sponsored jointly by the Lexington Herald-Leader, the Courier-Journal, WKYT-TV and WHAS-TV, found that Paul would beat Clinton in Kentucky 48 percent to 44 percent.\n\nSurveyUSA conducted the poll of 1,782 registered voters from May 14 to 16. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.4 percentage points.\n\nBe the first to know. No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. SIGN ME UP!\n\nPaul's lead over Clinton appears to be partially a function of gender at this point, with Paul winning 55 percent of men to Clinton's 38 percent and Clinton winning women 50 percent to 42 percent.\n\nStephen Voss, a political science professor at the University of Kentucky, said he has heard a lot of interest in the potential face-off between Paul and Clinton.\n\n\"It's like asking whether Superman or Batman would win if they got into a fight,\" Voss said. \"People know the battle isn't likely to happen, but they want to fantasize about it anyway.\"\n\nWhile Clinton has remained largely silent about whether she will take the plunge and run in 2016, Paul has enjoyed a whirlwind 2014 that has seen him pronounced the front-runner in some circles for the Republican nomination.\n\nThe senator has joked that the designation sounds \"unlucky,\" but has worked overtime to court major GOP donors and voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and other early primary states should he decide to run.\n\nPaul has been clear that he plans to seek re-election to his Senate seat in 2016, but he has consistently said he might also run for president.\n\nA breakdown of the poll results reveals that Clinton does best in and around Louisville, beating Paul 48 percent to 46 percent. But Paul enjoys 10-point leads over Clinton in the western (50 percent to 40 percent) and eastern (52 percent to 42 percent) ends of the state.\n\nThe two potential candidates tie with 46 percent apiece in north-central Kentucky, an area that includes Lexington and much of Northern Kentucky.\n\n\"You cannot read too much into poll results about a contest that is not happening and that is still so purely hypothetical that voters have not actually made informed decisions yet,\" Voss cautioned. \"But the strong numbers for Clinton, even against a favorite son of the state, looks like a good sign for her in general. After years in the Obama administration, she has not shed the popularity in Kentucky that allowed her to perform so strongly in our Democratic primary.\"\n\n(Clinton trounced Barack Obama by 35 percentage points and 250,000 votes in Kentucky's Democratic primary for president in 2008.)\n\nPaul enjoys the support of 81 percent of Republican respondents to Clinton's 13 percent, while Clinton has the support of 75 percent of Democrats to Paul's 19 percent. Among independents, Paul leads Clinton 44 percent to 40 percent.\n\nBroken down by ideology, Clinton wins 59 percent of self-described \"moderates\" to 33 percent for Paul. Among respondents who described themselves as conservative, Paul bests Clinton 79 percent to 15 percent, but among liberals, Clinton enjoys 88 percent of support to Paul's 6 percent.\n\nWhile Paul has made outreach to minority groups one of his top priorities, the poll found that only 29 percent of black respondents would back Paul compared with 62 percent who would vote for Clinton.\n\nRespondent Regina Lees of Elizabethtown said it's way past time to have a female president.\n\n\"I simply would vote for Hillary Clinton for president over Rand Paul because she's a woman. Women are a lot smarter than men,\" she said.\n\nBut James Mercer, who works in construction in Bowling Green, said he could never support Clinton.\n\n\"She let the world slide as secretary of state with the mess in Benghazi and she would perpetuate Obamacare,\" he said. \"I'm not particularly in love with Rand Paul, but I could never go for Hillary.\"\n\nAsked whether he ever could vote for a woman to be president, he responded: \"I could support a woman like (former Secretary of State) Condoleezza Rice, but she's too smart to run.\""}
{"text": "So this happened to me:\n\nIt turns out that a whole lot of things explode when your system boots up with /bin/sh not working for some mysterious reason.\n\nHere the mysterious reason was that there was an unresolved dynamic library symbol, so any attempt to run /bin/sh or /bin/bash died with an error message from the ELF interpreter.\n\nThe big surprise for me was just how far my systemd-based Fedora 23 machine managed to get despite this handicap. I certainly saw a cascade of unit failures in the startup messages so I knew that something bad had happened, but the first inkling I had of just how bad it was came when I tried to log in as root on the (text) console and the system just dumped me back at the login: prompt. Most of the system services had managed to start because their systemd .service files did not need /bin/sh to run; only a few things (some of them surprising) had failed, although a dependency chain for one of them wound up blocking the local resolving DNS server from starting.\n\nThe unpleasant surprise was how much depends on /bin/sh and /bin/bash working. I was able to log in as myself because I use a different shell, but obviously root was inaccessible, my own environment relies on a certain amount of shell scripts to be really functional, and a surprising number of standard binaries are shell scripts these days ( /usr/bin/fgrep , for example). In the end I got somewhat lucky in that my regular account had sudo access and sudo can be used to run things directly, without needing /bin/sh or root's shell to be functioning.\n\n(I mostly wound up using this to run less to read logs and eventually reboot . If I'd been thinking more carefully, I could have used sudo to run an alternate shell as root, which would have been almost as good as being able to log in directly.)\n\nAnother pretty useful thing here is how systemd captured a great deal of the error output from startup services and recorded it in the systemd journal. This gave me the exact error messages, for example, which is at least reassuring to have even if I don't understand what went wrong.\n\nWhat I don't have here is an exciting story of how I revived a system despite its /bin/sh being broken. In the end the problem went away after I rebooted and then power cycled my workstation. Based on the symptoms I suspect that a page in RAM got scrambled somehow (which honestly is a bit unnerving).\n\nAs a side note, the most surprising thing that failed to start was udev trying to run the install command for the sound card drivers (specifically snd_pcm ). I suspect that this is used to restore the sound volume settings to whatever they were the last time the system was shut down, but I don't know for sure because things didn't report the exact command being executed or whatever.\n\n(My system has a 90-alsa-restore.rules udev rules file that tries to run alsactl . It's not clear to me if udev executes RUN+= commands via system() , which would have hit the issue, or in some more direct way. Maybe it depends on whether the RUN command seems to have anything that needs interpretation by the shell. I'm pretty certain that at least some udev RUN actions succeeded.)\n\nSidebar: What exactly was wrong\n\nThis was on my Fedora 23 office machine, where /bin/sh is bash, and bash was failing to start with a message to the effect of:\n\nsymbol lookup error: /bin/bash: undefined symbol: rl_unix_line_disc<binary garbage>\n\nBash does not mention a symbol with that exact name, but it does want to resolve and use rl_unix_line_discard . Interestingly, this is an internal symbol (it's both used and defined in bash); despite this, looking it up goes via the full dynamic linker symbol resolution process (as determined with the help of LD_DEBUG ). My guess is that the end of the symbol name was overwritten in RAM with some garbage and that this probably happened in the Linux kernel page cache (since it kept reappearing with the same message, it can't have been in a per-process page).\n\nAssuming I'm reading things correctly, the bytes of garbage are (in hex):\n\nae 37 d8 5f bf 6b d1 45 3a c0 d9 93 1b 44 12 2d 68 74"}
{"text": "VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Roman Catholicism faces a serious challenge from the rising number of people who believe in God but no longer see any need for a church, according to New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan.\n\nCardinal Timothy Dolan, the Archbishop of New York, looks at the helicopter (not pictured) carrying Pope Benedict XVI fly off from the Vatican, on its way to the papal summer residence at Castelgandolfo, February 28, 2013. REUTERS/Yara Nardi\n\nOpinion research shows that some people today have problems \"with the very nature and meaning of the church\", Dolan, in Rome to prepare for a conclave to elect a replacement to the retired Pope Benedict, told Reuters in an interview.\n\nDolan said this trend, which sociologists of religion call \"believing without belonging\", should be high on the list of issues that cardinals discuss at the Vatican next week before they retreat into the Sistine Chapel to vote for the pope.\n\nBenedict officially stepped down on Thursday, the first pope in almost six centuries to do so, and the 115 cardinals due to pick his successor began informal meetings on Friday to discuss procedures for the vote and size up candidates.\n\n\"We hear that more and more people have absolutely no problem with faith, but they do with religion,\" Dolan, 63 and mentioned among possible candidates for the papacy, said.\n\n\"While more and more people have no problem at all with Jesus Christ, they love him and accept him as their Lord and saviour, they do have problems with the church,\" he said. \"More and more people don't see the need for the church.\"\n\nThe phrase \"believing without belonging\", coined by British sociologist Grace Davie in the 1990s, describes the growing number of people who say they are \"spiritual but not religious\" and leave organised religion behind.\n\nThe trend, seen in Europe and North America, has especially hurt established Christian churches that have seen their ranks dwindle.\n\nIn the United States, the \"nones\" - people with no religious affiliation - have grown from seven to 18 percent of the population since 1972, according to a Pew Forum study.\n\nA third of those born after 1980 are unaffiliated, it said, compared to 15 percent among their \"baby boom\" parents and five percent in their grandparents' generation.\n\nDolan noted this and other studies showed most Catholics did not abandon the \"faith of their fathers\", but the church could not ignore the trend. \"It is a problem,\" he said.\n\nFor Catholics, he said, faith in and love of Jesus Christ have always been linked with being part of the church.\n\n\"The two were a package deal - you don't have one without the other,\" he said. \"We have to reclaim that lustre. We have to reclaim that relationship that Jesus and his church are one.\"\n\nRELIGIOUS PERSECUTION\n\nThe New York archbishop said the Catholic Church, which with 1.2 billion faithful is by far the world's largest church, should also become more active in fighting religious persecution against people of all faiths around the globe.\n\nAt a recent synod of bishops to discuss Church efforts to revive Catholicism's missionary spirit, he said, several bishops suggested the Vatican create a separate office to monitor violations of religious liberty around the world.\n\n\"If people are persecuted anywhere for their religious belief, they should be able to look to the Catholic Church as a major defender,\" he said.\n\nDolan, who has led opposition to the Obama administration's healthcare mandate requiring religious institutions to provide birth control in their health plans, said this office should also monitor violations that \"take place not in Third World countries but in First World countries\".\n\n\"There seems to be a pretty well oiled choreography to reduce religion and faith to the excessively private and where religion may have absolutely no public witness and voice in the public square,\" he said.\n\n\"That's another subtle form of religious persecution.\"\n\nReform of the Curia, whose mismanagement has become a pressing issue before the conclave, must be considered but \"I don't think we need to get overly obsessed with that,\" he said.\n\nDolan has joked that anyone who lists him among potential popes \"must have been smoking marijuana\", and laughed off talk in Rome that he could emerge from the Sistine Chapel in white papal robes.\n\n\"I don't know what other way to say I find that extraordinarily unlikely,\" he declared."}
{"text": "A group of Boy Scouts examines the skeleton of the Jurassic dinosaur Stegosaurus at the Smithsonian.\n\nDinosaurs that roamed the Earth 250 million years ago knew a world with five times more carbon dioxide than is present on Earth today, researchers say, and new techniques for estimating the amount of carbon dioxide on prehistoric Earth may help scientists predict how Earth's climate may change in the future.\n\nThe findings are detailed in a recent paper published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nDuring the Jurassic Period, dinosaurs — ranging from the plant-eating Diplodocus and Brachiosaurus to the meat-craving Ceratosaurus and Megalosaurus — ruled the world. During this time, the Earth's interior was not standing still; rather, the supercontinent Pangaea had started to split into two smaller landmasses, called Laurasia and Gondwana.\n\nThese tectonic movements made the oceans close up and the tectonic plates sink into the Earth. This process, called subduction,led to volcanism at the surface, with rocks constantly melting and emitting CO2 into the atmosphere. Huge amounts of this greenhouse gas made the climate during the Jurassic Period extremely humid and warm, said geoscientist Douwe van der Meer, lead author of the study and a researcher at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. [Weather vs. Climate: Test Yourself]\n\nScientists have known for some time that a large amount of volcanic activity results in more CO2 than is present on Earth today, but with previous methods, it had been tricky to come up with a reliable estimate.\n\nLooking deep inside\n\nVan der Meer's team used a cutting-edge imaging technique called seismic tomography to reconstruct 250 million years of volcanic CO2 emissions.\n\nTo do so, the researchers analyzed earthquake waves traveling through Earth, to image the structure of the Earth's interior.\n\n\"This method is comparable to CT scans used in hospitals to image inside bodies,\" van der Meer said. \"With sufficient earthquake wave travel times, one can create a velocity model of the Earth. Faster regions are more dense, colder material plates that sunk into the Earth.\"\n\nThe aim has been to demonstrate how variations in plate tectonics have led to variations in CO2 emissions from volcanoes 250 million years ago.\n\nAnd the deeper the imaging equipment goes, the farther back in time scientists can see — as far back as 250 million years, said van der Meer. \"Essentially, we can see the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea, and the opening and closing of oceans,\" he said.\n\nIn other words, the scans depicted the interior of the Earth, enabling the researchers to \"see\" the tectonic plates that have sunk into the planet over the past 250 million years.\n\nThe researchers then quantified the plates that have sunk into the deep Earth, and their calculations showed that the Earth produced twice as much CO2 as there is today.\n\nThe scientists then inserted this number into a comprehensive, commonly used paleoclimate model, to calculate how all the volcanic CO2 emissions at the time would have added up. Because there was also less CO2 being removed from the atmosphere by vegetation and by weathering rocks than today, total atmospheric CO2 levels were probably five times higher than at the present, the researchers said.\n\nThe findings suggest much higher CO2 levels than had been estimated in previous studies conducted in the 1980s and 1990s. That research had been based on indirect data from sea-level variations. Since then, scientists' understanding of Earth has improved significantly, and researchers already had begun to suspect that the old estimates were imperfect.\n\n\"They were fundamentally flawed in hindsight,\" said van der Meer. \"Especially in the Jurassic Period, major differences were seen between the old and the new estimates.\"\n\n\"The higher CO2 levels [must] have [had] significant effects on the planet's climate, and its flora and fauna,\" he said.\n\nAnd, in general, the concept of plate tectonics through time is crucial for a variety of geological processes, said van der Meer. \"The rate of spreading plates dictates the height of mountains, the amount and location of ores, sea level and the magnetic field of the planet,\" he said. \"For the first time, we have quantified in this study the link between plate tectonics and volcanic CO2 emissions — a major step forward in understanding and predicting the behavior of the Earth, and its consequences.\" [History's Biggest Earthquakes]"}

And sometimes there's the teenager near the Bank of Ireland on the quay with a cup in his hand. Yesterday they had disappeared.\n\nThe city's small Roma community is living in fear, say its members, and are afraid to show their faces in public.\n\nAlmost 200 people gathered in Waterford city last Saturday evening outside the home of a large Roma family – including toddlers and children – and staged a protest in which windows were smashed and doors broken down. Some Roma families had to be evacuated from their homes and are now living at undisclosed addresses.\n\nThe following night a smaller group also protested and kicked at the doors of a building they believed housed members of the Roma community.\n\nIt was the culmination of tension which has been building for some time – most of it whipped up over social media – over street begging and crime in the city. Numerous Facebook pages have appeared over recent months, labelling members of the Roma community as scum and threatening to \"burn the cockroaches out\". Most have since been taken down, only to be replaced with new pages.\n\nA counter-demonstration in the city last night, organised by Waterford Against Racism, called for calm and opposed any attempt to tackle local problems through vigilantism. About 100 people gathered on a drizzly night in John Roberts Square, against the backdrop of a heavy Garda presence.\n\n\"Yes ,there is crime in Waterford and yes, there is crime in the Roma community,\" Seamus O'Brien, a member of Waterford Against Racism, told the gathering. \"But there's also crime in my family and yours. We can't allow ourselves to descend to mob rule and racist commentary on social media to solve this. We need to say 'no' to racism, and 'yes' to ending poverty.\"\n\nHe said the Garda superintendent had told local politicians and representatives that the vast majority of crime in the city had nothing to do with the Roma community.\n\n'People are very, very scared'\n\nStelian Ciuciu, of the Roma Integration Association, said many members of the community had little choice but to beg, and pleaded for greater understanding. \"People are very, very scared . . . These are people who are not educated. They do not get social welfare, many of them. This is what they know. People need to understand this,\" he said.\n\nFew elected representatives from the major political parties were present at the gathering, although all parties have strongly criticised last weekend's trouble.\n\nAcross the city in Manor Street, residents who agreed to be interviewed had mixed feelings over the local disturbances at the weekend.\n\nNone defended the attacks on the local homes; and they claimed local criminal elements were involved in the intimidation of the Roma. But many felt issues involving crime and begging needed to be addressed by the Garda.\n\n\"I pride myself on not being a racist,\" said Bernard Cleary (39). \"I try not to label people. But there are issues that need to be addressed. But the begging is an issue and I know people who've been victims of crime involving the community.\"\n\nAnother man in his 60s – a former Waterford Crystal worker – said the begging was tarnishing the image of the city at a time when it was trying to attract tourists.\n\n\"A lot of people are sick of it. We're doing our best to attract these people. If it keeps up, they just won't come any more.\"\n\nThe attacks at the weekend have also taken on a political edge, with some politicians privately blaming others of stoking up anger.\n\nSinn Féin councillor John Hearne, who has taken a strong stance against crime in the city, has previously highlighted crime involving some foreign elements. But yesterday he insisted any targeting of the Roma community was reprehensible.\n\nMost in the city agreed the actions of just 200 people last weekend did not represent the view of the vast majority of the city's 50,000 residents.\n\n\"Begging is a problem,\" said local resident Dermot Keyes. \"The problem here is we don't have enough gardaí to tackle street crime. Some Roma might be involved but by far and away the biggest crime problem we have is home-grown and involves people born and bred in the city.\""}
{"text": "We have chosen to archive sumoshell as we can not continue to support its growth. The original author has created a spiritual successor called angle-grinder and we recommend you investigate that.\n\nsumoshell\n\nSumoshell is collection of utilities to improve analyzing log files written in Go. grep can't tell that some log lines span multiple individual lines. Parsing out fields is cumbersome. Aggregating is basically impossible, and there is no good way to view the results. In Sumoshell, each individual command acts as a phase in a pipeline to get the answer you want. Sumoshell brings a lot of the functionality of Sumo Logic to the command line.\n\nCommands should start with sumo search [filter] which will transform logs into the json format sumoshell uses. Commands should end with render or graph which render the output to the terminal. Each operator is a stand-alone binary allowing them to be easily composed.\n\nInstallation\n\nOSX and Linux binaries are provided for sumoshell. Simply extract the archive and place the binaries on your path.\n\nIf you run a different OS or would prefer to install from source, it's easy to build from source.

Pipelines start with a source ( tail , cat , etc.) followed by the sumo operator. An example pipeline might be:\n\ntail -f logfile | sumo search \"ERROR\" | sumo parse \"thread=*]\" | sumo count thread | render\n\nThis would produce a count of log messages matching ERROR by thead. In the basic renderer, the output would look like:\n\n_Id _count thread 0 4 C 1 4 A 2 1 B\n\nThe sumo search operator\n\nsumo search takes an optional filter parameter to allow for basic searching. The sumo operator performs 3 steps:\n\nBreak a text file into logical log messages. This merges things like stack traces into a single message for easy searching. Allow basic searching.

{"text": "A few weeks ago we launched our new webmail service for all users at FastMail. Once being used by a wider audience, we of course received reports of a few edge cases our testing hadn't managed to uncover. One of the more interesting issues we discovered came from this use case: our user liked to scroll down his inbox, opening each email he wanted to read in a new tab in the background. Then he would go through the tabs, closing each one as he was done with it. So far, so good. Except, in Chrome, his browser of choice, as soon as about 5 tabs were open, the rest failed to load, and the earlier ones then started having communication errors as well.\n\nA quick bit of research and testing yielded the problem: Chrome limits itself to a maximum of 6 concurrent connections to a single origin across the whole browser. Each tab was loading a full instance of the mail application, which meant it was creating an EventSource object and connection to our push server, to be notified of new deliveries (see this previous post for how that works). Since these connections are permanent (that's the whole idea!), opening lots of tabs quickly used up all the available connections, with none left to fetch any actual data. To the user, this appeared as \"Could not connect to server\" error messages.\n\nThe solution to this problem was not immediately obvious. Ideally, we would like to maintain a single push connection and share it between the tabs, but there's no API for getting a reference to other tabs or windows in the browser, even if they're pointed to the same domain. Then I remembered that setting a property on local storage triggers a \"storage\" event on the window object of every open tab with the same origin. This, I realised, could be used to synchronise behaviour across tabs.\n\nThe concept is fairly simple. Only one tab keeps a push connection; we call this the master tab. When it receives a push event, it broadcasts it by setting the event as a property on local storage called \"broadcast\". When a tab receives the storage event for this key, it reads the JSON-encoded event object from local storage and processes it as though it had been received via an EventSource object.\n\nThe tricky part comes in coordinating between the tabs who should be master. The master tab also sets a value called \"ping\" on local storage roughly every 30 seconds to the current time stamp. When a tab first loads it checks for this value; if it is greater than 45 seconds ago it presumes there is no current master, so it becomes master. Otherwise, it becomes a slave. However, whilst it is a slave, it continuously monitors for storage events with a key of \"ping\", and if it hasn't heard a ping within a 45 second period, it takes over as master. This switches control to another tab when the master tab closes. On browsers supporting the \"unload\" event we can make the changeover happen pretty much instantly, by setting the \"ping\" value to 0 in local storage when the tab is closed.\n\nThis all works very well, but there's one problem remaining: race conditions. There is no API for taking out an explicit lock on local storage, so the spec advocates the use of a per-origin mutex which would be acquired by scripts once they try to access the storage, and then released when the script finishes. Not all browsers have adopted this. The Chrome developers, for example, have decided the performance penalty is too great. Therefore, in some browsers, it is possible for scripts in different tabs to interleave such that, for example, each tries to take master at the same time, then each notices another has taken it so none end up as master! The solution we have adopted is to add a random component to the delay between pings and waiting for pings. This makes it unlikely that two tabs will both attempt to take master at the same time. Of course this can still happen, but should it do so, the random variation in each new master sending out a ping should ensure that one is quickly turned back to a slave.

Extreme style and extreme performance are the chief characteristics of Ferrari's national rival. Unless your zip code is 90210, you're not likely to see a scissor-doored Lamborghini ahead of you in the Starbucks drive-thru or parked next to you at the mall; these are exclusive automobiles designed to cater to a small, very specialized audience.\n\nDuring World War II, company founder Ferruccio Lamborghini served with the Italian Air Force's mechanics corps, where he became proficient at working with engines. After the war, Italy was plagued with scarcity; one such shortage involved tractors. Sensing an opportunity, Lamborghini purchased surplus military machines and reconfigured them as tractors. It was a canny move that resulted in a thriving business for the young entrepreneur, one that quickly made him a very wealthy man.\n\nBy the 1950s, Lamborghini's business had become even more successful, expanding to include heaters and air-conditioning units. As a car enthusiast, Lamborghini drove the best sports cars of the day. Somewhat disappointed with the Ferraris, he vowed to build a better car. Armed with millions of lira in investment money, he retreated to the small village of Sant'Agata to build a state-of-the-art automotive factory. On his payroll was noted automotive engineer Giotto Bizzarrini, who'd previously worked at Ferrari.\n\nAutomobili Lamborghini SpA. was officially founded in 1963. That same year, the very first Lamborghini, the 350GT, debuted at the Turin Motor Show. The car's name came from its engine size, a 3.5-liter four-cam V12. Then came the 400GT, which was produced until 1968. But it was the stunning midengine Miura, produced from 1967-'73, that catapulted Lamborghini to worldwide acclaim.\n\nLamborghini's tractor business suffered hard times in the early '70s, which led him to sell a controlling interest of Automobili Lamborghini SpA to a Swiss industrialist. The Italian's problems were worsened by that decade's oil crisis, and he wound up selling the remaining amount of his shares. Still, Lamborghini had found the wherewithal to bring out the Miura's replacement, the iconic Countach, for 1974. The company also invested millions in the development of a new vehicle, the military truck-style Cheetah, but its sales were disappointing. By the end of the decade, the automaker had declared bankruptcy.\n\nThe company got back on its feet in the 1980s. The key was Lamborghini's over-the-top Countach. Though introduced previously, the Countach was now fully styled with outlandish vents, aggressive fender flares and a huge rear wing that made it the perfect exotic car for that's decade's brash mentality. Perhaps hoping to cash in on the firm's revived popularity, the company's managers sold Lamborghini to Chrysler in 1987.\n\nThe '90s started out with the debut of the Countach's successor, the Diablo. Not long after, though, another change of ownership took place in 1994, when Lamborghini was acquired by three Far Eastern companies. Megatech was the largest of the trio and the primary shareholder. By the late 1990s, Lamborghini was in financial hot water once again. As before, the lack of a diversified product lineup was hurting the company's ability to compete globally. It was acquired by Volkswagen (which also owns other luxury marques such as Audi and Bentley) in 1998.\n\nThe new millennium saw the debut of the Murcielago, which replaced the Diablo, and the (relatively) more affordable Gallardo. Today, the current German/Italian marriage seems to be quite stable, and the rise in quality and refinement of Lamborghini's vehicles leaves no doubt as to its benefit.\n\nOur expert team of auto researchers have reviewed the Lamborghini cars and compiled a list of inventory for you to lease a Lamborghini and shop new and used Lamborghini.\n\nHide Lamborghini History"}
{"text": "This week, the management group overseeing Germany's Nürburgring Nordschleife moved to ban manufacturers from attempting and publishing timed laps on the famed, 13-mile course. For car enthusiasts who judge modern sports cars by how quickly they can round the circuit, it's an unthinkable, if not wholly unexpected, turn of events.\n\nFor Christian Von Koenigsegg, it's even more disappointing; the news comes just days before he was to spend a week at the circuit with the new Koenigsegg One:1 hypercar in hopes of setting a lap record. It's part of Koenigsegg's three-year plan to establish the One:1 as the fastest production car in the world.\n\nIt was early Tuesday morning when I received an urgent phone call from Christian. In two days, I was to jump on a plane with my team to capture the Koenigsegg lap-time effort for our upcoming 4K documentary, APEX, which we're producing in conjunction with Sony. This is the final chapter in a storyline that follows the past three years of auto manufacturers battling it out for technological dominance in producing halo cars for the next decade, cars including the Porsche 918, McLaren P1, and Ferrari LaFerrari. All have shown what they're worth on the track, but the Koenigsegg One:1 has yet to do so.\n\nNow we have a new story to tell: The Nürburgring benchmark of sports-car superiority has come to a screeching halt, and the Koenigsegg One:1's place on the leaderboard is in jeopardy. We'd been on stand-by to fly across the Atlantic (on moments' notice) to capture Koenigsegg's attempt. This time, helicopter crews were ready to go, logistics were sorted, and travel was booked. The sudden notification from Nürburgring management couldn't have come at a more inopportune moment for everyone.\n\nThe decision to ban timed laps stems from an accident earlier this year at a VLN race, involving driver Jann Mardenborough, in which a spectator was killed. Track management reacted by imposing a speed limit at Flugplatz, where the crash occurred. Since then, management has imposed further restrictions in other high-speed sectors. This is a particularly disappointing development for Koenigsegg, since the One:1's flat-out speed in those sectors would likely have given it a lap-time advantage. In Tiergarten, for instance, a long, fast section where Christian estimates the One:1 could easily hit 300 kph, speed is now restricted to just 200 kph.\n\nOfficial word from Nurburgring management is that these restrictions will be reviewed at the end of the year, but for the time being, manufacturers like Koenigsegg are banned from attempting lap-time runs — even if they've rented out the entire track for themselves. The Koenigsegg team and the One:1 are now stuck in a holding pattern. They have a car that's ready to attack the northern loop. Their simulations and data suggest they've got a good chance to best their competitors. Even Koenigsegg's past track data suggests their best segment times, when stitched together, would undercut the Porsche 918's official 6:57 time by double-digit seconds.\n\nBut there's a twist to the story. After the initial restrictions were in place, Lamborghini ran its new Aventador SV and published a sub-seven-minute lap time. Nürburgring management claims Lamborghini's attempt happened one day before they issued the latest round of restrictions. Yet at the same time, WTCC laps have been allowed to ignore all speed limits all together? What's the deal? We're investigating.\n\nSo what's next for Koenigsegg and our film, APEX? The helicopter crews are ready, the One:1 is ready, but we don't have anywhere to run the car.\n\nIs there a new benchmark to be set? Should nearby Spa Francorchamps, another long, high-speed track with motorsports provenance, become the new venue for lap time tests? Maybe a stateside circuit like the four-mile West Grand course at VIR would fit the bill? What about setting an endurance record? Let the Reddit car forums march with their keyboards and pitchforks.\n\nAuthor: J.F.

{"text": "The WHO is the world's leading health organisation guiding governments around the world. So we expect their advice to be up to date and evidence-based, particularly on controversial topics. One of the most controversial topics of our time is the international community's approach to drug policy, particularly that relating to the most popular so-called \"illegal\" drug – cannabis. Yet the WHO's advice on the harms and (lack of) benefits of cannabis is based on a decision made 82 years ago, by its predecessor, the League of Nations. Thankfully, there is now hope that this is about to change.\n\nThe WHO advises the UN, which states international control of drugs – so the view of the WHO really matters. The reality is that almost every country in the world (197 in total) sign up to follow WHO advice and so its current stance means punitive measures for cannabis – including lifetime in prison in some countries. Cannabis is still scheduled as having the highest level of harm and no medical value, despite reams of evidence to contrary. It is significantly less harmful than alcohol and shows real medical benefit, particularly in the treatment of pain, spasticity, and some forms of epilepsy. Due to these therapeutic effects, over 18 countries and over 200 million US citizens now have access to licensed medicinal cannabis. Consequently, the idea that cannabis isn't a medicine is considerably less plausible now than when this decision was made in 1934. Worse still, the actual report on which cannabis was scheduled in 1934 can no longer be found so it may be that the decades-long ban on cannabis is based on real errors of fact!\n\nWhat is equally problematic is that the current legal status of cannabis means that research into its potential benefits – or harms - is really tough because of the regulations that accompany its Schedule 1 status. For example, in the UK medical researchers like me need a special license to hold cannabis for research though as a doctor I can prescribe heroin - a much more dangerous and sought-after drug. The UK government believes that it can't change this prohibitionist position and still comply with the UN conventions. This is untrue, as The Netherlands has demonstrated for over 30 years, but the easiest way to get a change in the UK policy would be if the WHO led the way.\n\nIt is vital that experts take all latest data into account during such a vital review, and to this end DrugScience has produced a detailed up-to-date assessment of cannabis for the public as well as the WHO and UN. This report authored by 4 experts – two from DrugScience - provides the vital background evidence on which a sensible modern re-assessment of cannabis can be made. This should lead to an appreciation that cannabis has medical value in some illnesses, and so encourage research into its potential for others, such as cancer, ADHD and PTSD. A proper review of cannabis could also encourage a more nuanced view of the comparative harms of different forms of cannabis, helping direct users away from the strong d9THC/low cannabidiol variants such as \"skunk\" that appear significantly different from more traditional herbal or resin forms of cannabis.\n\nBig issues like this need that affect hundreds of millions of people across the globe need to determined based on the best and most current evidence available. Leading organisations such as the WHO and UN need to be able to move quickly to try and avoid the public losing out.\n\nAt last there has been some progress! This came from the recent meeting of the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence in the WHO headquarters in Geneva. Here the Expert Committee and the WHO Lead for Medicines, Dr Suzanne Hill, were presented with the report by the DrugScience team. They also heard powerful supporting arguments from two other expert groups (the International Drug Policy Consortium and the International Association for Hospice & Palliative Care) both of whom also made it clear that there was a pressing need for a review of cannabis scheduling.\n\nThe DrugScience team argued that the Expert Committee had the right to change its agenda to start a full pre-review of cannabis immediately based on our WHO-standard report. This they declined to do, but it seems our arguments were heeded as an official pre-review has been ordered, to be completed before the next meeting of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs in 2018.\n\nThis move by the WHO is encouraging as its perception as being an evidence-based health organisation has become seriously questioned by its failure to consider the evolving facts on cannabis. It is critical that the review they conduct is honest, transparent and fully evidence-based; for surely then it will be impossible for the UN to continue to argue that cannabis should be scheduled as being extremely harmful and lacking medical value!"}

Furthermore, a number of ad hoc sessions are also offered, while Education also includes sessions for student nurses/midwives, secondary or post-secondary students.\n\nParentcraft Courses include: Early Pregnancy Courses (starting from 10 weeks pregnancy) and Childbirth Courses (usually starting from 28 – 30 weeks pregnancy). The latter are also available for specific groups, including English Speaking Clients, parents with other children (Refresher), Couples expecting Multiples, and School-age clients (held at Ghozza).\n\nCourses are offered in the morning, afternoon and evening. This includes weekdays, Saturdays, Sundays and even Public Holidays. Most times, 2 or more concurrent sessions are held. As can be expected, the most popular lectures are those held in the evenings, weekends, and on Sunday mornings, with the latter having 4 or even 5 concurrent sessions. Evening, weekend, and Sunday groups are considerably large, with an average of 18-22 couples per group.\n\nFurthermore, there has been a considerable increase in one-to-one sessions. These include clients with special needs, e.g. partner abroad, single mothers with problems, social problems, drug abuse, low IQ; deaf/dumb; pre-adoptive parents; etc.\n\nOther sessions are also held regularly, in liaison with other Units/Departments. These include sessions about Dental Care, Standards of Childcare Centres, Stem Cell Collection, Speech and Language Development, Healthy Weight in Infants and Toddlers, etc.\n\nBesides lectures at MDH, Parentcraft Education is also offered through the Media, through various professional handouts and booklets, and through active participation and organization of conferences for the general public.\n\nFurthermore, an innovative project is the \"Mother and Child module\" being presently offered to 175 MCAST Students.\n\nFurthermore, Parentcraft Services Support has a very popular Support Tel. Helpline - 2545 5124, where clients can call in, to ask help for any problem, both during pregnancy or after delivery. The telephone helpline is open to all, including those who have never attended, relatives, and anyone wishing to make use of this service. Calls vary from brief ones enquiring about the courses or about their applications, to complicated and intense ones, sometimes requiring referral to other Departments/Units.\n\nThere has also been a significant increase in one-to-one counselling sessions, presenting mostly with pregnancy-related, emotional, or social issues, the latter many times requiring referral to the Social Work Unit. We also have the possibility of referral for Familiy Therapy.\n\nFurthermore, Parent Craft Services works in close liaison with various Services and Departments, including: Ghozza (Education Department – formerly called School Girl Mothers Unit), Il-Benniena and Homestart (Social Services); SANDS (Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society) and the Bereavement Midwife; ABC (Association of Breastfeeding Counsellors) and Breastfeeding Walk-In Clinic; Caesarean Support Group, TIPS (Tiny Infant Parent Support); Multiple Connection, Richmond Foundation, Institute of Familty Therapy (IFT), SEDQA, Midwives Association, Health Promotion Unit, Faculty of Health, Institute for Further Studies, MCAST, etc\n\nParentcraft Services also has a generic email - parentcraft@gov.mt that serves both for Education and for Support purposes, while arrangements are being made to offer a Facebook page.\n\nMany more projects are in the offing, including Early Pregnancy Courses for Teenage Mums-to-be which will start in November/December 2013. These specific courses will be offered on Sunday mornings, so that they will not interfere with school.

{"text": "As much as we've enjoyed this late-season version of the Leafs with their new dose of youth, the fact remains that this is a team sitting thirtieth in a league of thirty. Whether this iteration of the roster would operate at that level if given the whole year is probably debatable, but as Mike Babcock has even alluded to recently, you have to be careful about buying too much into this kind of short-term success we've seen in the last week or so.\n\nBut even with all that in mind, we can still take look at some of these kids – a few now approaching the 15-game mark – to see how they've been performing to date, both production-wise and in terms of pushing play in the right direction. As we all know, these waves can, in fact, die, so it's good to look at who's been for real.\n\nPerhaps the best story of this Leafs youth movement since the deadline is that of Connor Carrick. When Toronto pulled the trigger on the Winnik trade last month, most of the early response was \"Yes, another draft pick\", referring to the second-rounder they picked up, but we then quickly learned that the Leafs were pretty high on Carrick and pushed to have him in the deal. He was no throw-in.\n\nA glance at Carrick's career numbers at first probably suggested to many of us he's a project-type prospect, as he's plugged away for most of the last two years at the AHL level after breaking in with the Capitals in 2013. And as we've come to learn with someone like T.J. Brennan, even with strong offensive numbers, breaking out of the AHL can be impossible for some, especially defencemen. But that's more of a cautionary tale, and considering Carrick is still a youngster, his future is obviously more wide open. He's actually a month younger than Morgan Rielly.\n\nConsidering all of this, it's been somewhat surprising to see Carrick get such a good look with the big club right away. But the looks of things early on, it was the right call.\n\nNow that we've had some time to evaluate the trade, it seems the Leafs were smart to key in on Carrick, as he was sort of a victim of circumstance with the Caps, a team in prime contention and loaded with depth on the blue-line for the long term. With a rebuilding team in Toronto he can immediately factor into their plans, and so far he's shown why with Babcock and his crew giving him plenty of opportunity already.\n\nIn his audition with the Leafs (that will take him through the rest of the schedule), Carrick has already nabbed a pair of goals and assists through twelve games. While those obviously aren't eye-popping numbers, it's still an impressive 27-point pace over an entire schedule for a guy who's tasked with about 15-16 minutes per night.\n\nCarrick's underlying numbers have been strong as well, as he's been clipping along at 55% in terms of score-adjusted Corsi For, also good for +2.3% relative to his teammates when he isn't out there. Keep in mind he's spent the majority of his time at even-strength alongside Gardiner, perhaps the Leafs' best play-driver, but his numbers overall have looked fine.\n\nAgain, it's early, and these numbers are through 15 games this season (including three with the Capitals), but it's clear so far that Carrick is no anchor, or at least he hasn't shown to be yet. At the very least, it's hard to say he isn't a strong upgrade on the blue-line compared someone like Roman Polak, a player who has almost zero offensive upside and carries the unfortunate tag of \"defensive defenceman\" (usually just a nicer name for someone who gets hemmed in their own zone all night). Carrick has some nice puck skills, and as his experience in the NHL grows, his reads and overall offensive instincts should only get better.\n\nGiven where the Capitals and Leafs are in terms of contention and organizational depth, the deal that sent Carrick to Toronto last month should be looked upon as a move that made sense for both clubs. And who knows, maybe Lamoriello finds another way to add to the defence corps and push him down the lineup before next season. But for now, management, the coaching staff, and fans alike should all be pleased with how he's turned out so far given his place on the roster.\n\nNumbers from Corsica.Hockey and Hockey-Reference."}
{"text": "It's no secret that former President Barack Obama and his family love Martha's Vineyard, having vacationed on the idyllic Massachusetts island seven out of the eight summers they were in the White House, as well as this August. And rumors are now flying that they're looking to purchase property in the area.\n\nLocal real estate agents are tight-lipped on the reports that the Obamas are house-hunting, since part of the charm of this island is that despite its popularity, VIPs can still get plenty of privacy. That's why it's a magnet for celebs—including Bill Clinton, Larry David, Alan Dershowitz, and David Letterman—some of whom can be frequently sighted at low-key hotspots like the front porch of the Chilmark General Store. According to anonymous sources cited in the Boston Globe, the Obamas are shopping for homes or land lots in the northern, less populated regions of Aquinnah, Chilmark, and West Tisbury.\n\nIn particular, the Globe suggests the former president might be eyeing two oceanfront properties in Aquinnah that were once part of the 377-acre Red Gate Farm owned by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who passed this property down to Caroline Kennedy and her husband, Edwin Schlossberg. They later subdivided it into these two parcels.\n\nOne parcel is 75 acres at 8 Red Gate Farm Road, for sale at $15 million; it's pictured below.\n\n8 Red Gate Farm Road realtor.com\n\nThe second, seen below, is a 40-acre parcel at 6 Red Gate Farm Road, for sale at $12 million. Both are listed with Hancock Real Estate in Chilmark (which refused to comment when we called).\n\n6 Red Gate Farm Road\n\nGranted, even without a fabulous mansion on the premises, it's clear that either (or both!) of these properties would offer the Obamas a slice of heaven on earth.\n\n\"Both lots are stunning,\" says Joy Cifuni, a real estate agent in Cape Cod, MA, at Keller Williams. \"If I had to choose, I would pick the one for $15 million, because of the extra acres.\"\n\nWhile comps in this price range are tough to come by, a 106-acre lot at 3 Red Gate Farm Road sold in 2012 and is currently valued at $12,685,000. So, given that these lots for sale are in the same price range (or higher) but offer far less land, you've gotta wonder: Are they overpriced? Possibly, considering the length of time they've been lingering unsold.\n\n\"Both pieces of land have been on the market for 83 days,\" points out Cifuni. This could spell an opportunity for the Obamas, should they decide to make an offer.\n\n\"Personally, I would deduct 10% from asking,\" says Cifuni.\n\nThose savings could come in handy, since the Obamas will have to build a home from scratch, which is no small undertaking on this island south of Cape Cod.\n\n\"Being on the ocean creates its own challenges, like steps constantly washing out, erosion of land, and painting needing to be done more consistently because of salt,\" says Cifuni. \"Picking the right builder is the most important step they could possibly make.\"\n\nOther experts agree that building the perfect house could bring the former first family a ton of headaches.\n\n\"As good as a builder may be, problems always arise, causing delays,\" says Denise Supplee, a property management specialist at SparkRental. \"And although the Obamas do have a political advantage, there is much to deal with in zoning, licensing, permits, and ground preparation.\"\n\n\"The Obamas need to check all permits, and [see] if their land can be subdivided, and if it's on Wampanoag land,\" says Julianne Kavoussi, who has owned a home in the Edgartown part of the Vineyard for 20 years. The Wampanoag are Native American people who, she says, own a good portion of Aquinnah.\n\nNonetheless, this land is bound to be a great investment.\n\n\"Oceanfront property here holds its value,\" says Cifuni. \"It's the first to come up in price from a declining market, and the last to go down in a declining market.\"\n\nIn other words, if these rumors are to be believed, the Obamas have picked a great place to put down some roots. Lobster roll, anyone?"}
{"text": "SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email\n\nWell, that didn't take long.\n\nOn Monday, former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke started a blog at the Brookings Institution, and it has taken him only two days to get into a proper argument.\n\nWhen Bob Corker didn't rise to the bait on Monday, Bernanke turned his attention to former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and his secular stagnation thesis.\n\nWriting on Tuesday Bernanke said\n\nThe term \"secular stagnation\" was coined by Alvin Hansen in his 1938 American Economic Association presidential address, \"Economic Progress and Declining Population Growth.\" Writing in the latter stages of the Great Depression, Hansen argued that, because of apparent slowdowns in population growth and the pace of technological advance, firms were unlikely to see much reason to invest in new capital goods. ... Hansen proved quite wrong, of course, failing to anticipate the postwar economic boom (including both strong population growth—the baby boom—and rapid technological progress). However, Summers thinks that Hansen's prediction was not wrong, just premature.\n\nHe then goes on to explain why Larry is quite wrong in holding this opinion, arguing not only that the U.S. economy is not facing secular stagnation, but that even if it were, Larry's proposed solution—more fiscal spending—would be the wrong solution.\n\nThe former Federal Reserve chairman showed he is not against getting a nice blow in when an opportunity presents, saying:\n\nAs Larry's uncle Paul Samuelson taught me in graduate school at MIT, if the real interest rate were expected to be negative indefinitely, almost any investment is profitable.\n\nSummers was not going to take this lying down. He responded in a blog post published on Wednesday morning. Larry opens with faint praise, agreeing with Ben's assessment that the Federal Reserve is less powerful than it might assume:\n\nI agree with much of what Ben writes and would highlight in particular his recognition that the Fed is in a sense a follower rather than a leader with respect to real interest rates\n\nHe then goes on to use the 'uncle' stick to hit back at Ben.\n\nBen suggests not-- citing my uncle Paul Samuelson's famous observation that at a permanently zero or subzero real interest rate it would make sense to invest any amount to level a hill for the resulting saving in transportation costs. Ben grudgingly acknowledges that there are many theoretical mechanisms that could give rise to zero rates.\n\nLarry then moves on to the meat of the argument.\n\nBut he expresses the concern that permanently expansionary fiscal policy may not be possible, given that the government cannot indefinitely expand its debt. This issue is worth further theoretical exploration, but I think Ben greatly understates the scope for feasible fiscal policy for reasons that Brad Delong and I have considered in our 2012 BPEA paper.\n\nHe finishes his post saying he hopes that he is wrong about secular stagnation, but he adds that the \"vast majority\" of revisions in growth forecasts have been downward for many years.\n\nNo shrinking violet, Ben went straight back into the fight with a new post on Wednesday morning. He immediately points out the shortcomings of Larry's theory.\n\nA shortcoming of the secular stagnation hypothesis is that it focuses only on factors affecting domestic capital formation and domestic household spending. But US households and firms can also invest abroad, where many of the factors cited by secular stagnationists (such as slowing population growth) may be less relevant.\n\nBen then suggests that the problem is more likely to be a global savings glut—he provides data tables at the end of his post to back this—than secular stagnation.\n\nAs Summers has proposed, if secular stagnation is the reason for slow growth and low interest rates, expansionary fiscal policy could be helpful; and, in the longer run, the government could also take steps to improve the returns to capital investment, such as offering more favorable tax treatment and supporting research and development. If a global savings glut is the cause, then the right response is to try to reverse the various policies that generate the savings glut—for example, working to free up international capital flows and to reduce interventions in foreign exchange markets for the purpose of gaining trade advantage.\n\nWe await Larry's response.\n\nSo Ben Bernanke, the former central banker, sees monetary policy and structural reforms as the way forward. Larry Summers, the former Treasury Secretary, sees fiscal policy as the way forward. Quelle surprise, really.\n\nIt's a shame they can't agree on what the problem is.\n\nUntil they do, we all get to enjoy this (admittedly, slightly wonky) blog fight."}
{"text": "Senate support grows for Iran deal\n\nPresident Barack Obama's Iran deal looks increasingly likely to survive a challenge from congressional Republicans after several swing Democrats said they would back the deal just as the Senate sped toward recess on Wednesday.\n\nMinutes after Senate leaders locked in an agreement to begin debating the nuclear deal on Sept. 8, Independent Maine Sen. Angus King came to the floor to announce his support for the agreement. King's decision will make it hard for GOP opponents to block the lifting of legislative sanctions when the Senate votes no later than Sept. 17.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\"This is the most difficult decision I've ever had to make,\" King said. \"But in the end I decided the terms of this agreement are preferable to the alternatives.\"\n\nIn addition to King, Democratic Sens. Bill Nelson of Florida and Tim Kaine of Virginia also voiced support for the deal this week. Their support is invaluable for the White House: The trio of Democratic Caucus members were early backers of the review law that allows Congress to hold an up or down vote on the deal. And their support transforms the whip-counting operation for Republicans hoping to block the deal.\n\nWhile there are technically enough undecided Democrats for the GOP to marshal a veto-proof majority against the deal, many are reliable allies of the administration and are expected to back the agreement. More skeptical senators like Chuck Schumer of New York or Robert Menendez of New Jersey could still end up voting against the Iran deal and bring some colleagues with them, but the battle for votes appears to be a race to 60 instead of 67.\n\nIf Republicans can get at least six Democrats to support their cause in the Senate to break a filibuster, it would still be a significant achievement for the GOP. Sanctions on Iran would stay in place for 22 more days as Obama vetoed the disapproval resolution and Congress voted to override a veto, and a 60-vote bloc is always difficult to build. But it wouldn't be enough to block the deal.\n\nSen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) came to the Senate floor on Wednesday afternoon and sounded like he'd made a decision. But Flake, who Obama is aggressively courting to support the deal, still said he was undecided.\n\n\"I can only support an agreement that can endure,\" he said as he left the floor with a long summer recess and a big decision ahead of him.\n\nWith senators antsy to begin their August recess after a mostly fruitless week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) reached an agreement to start consideration of the Iran deal as soon as lawmakers return from the break. They also agreed on a process to finish a cybersecurity bill, but it could be months before that gets a vote in the Senate.\n\nMcConnell has said he hopes that all 100 senators participate in the Iran discussion while at their desks and has suggested that all committee hearings be canceled during the deliberations.\n\nReid, in a rare moment of comity between the two rival leaders, said: \"The debate we're going to have in a matter of weeks, I want it to be … dignified, befitting the gravity of the issue of the day. This is a step forward.\"\n\nLocking in the debate before breaking for the recess was a necessity with Rosh Hashanah disrupting the few days that the Senate will be in session in September. Under the agreement, the Senate will have no more than seven days to debate the Iran bill before proceeding to a vote.\n\nOn Wednesday alone there were four planned briefings and hearings on the Iran deal, with an evening classified briefing between senators and State Department official Wendy Sherman and Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz expected to cap off the summer schedule until September.\n\nSenate Republicans indicated this week they are planning for a vote on a resolution of disapproval for the deal with Iran. If the GOP determines it cannot get 60 votes behind that resolution, then they could put a resolution of approval up for a vote with the intention of it failing and embarrassing Obama, sources said.\n\nThe final text of the resolution that the Senate will vote on has not been publicly released. This week the House released its disapproval resolution, and Republicans said they already have enough votes to pass it.\n\nBut after several startling defections from New York House Democrats, like Steve Israel, Obama got some good news from the other side of the Capitol as well on Wednesday. Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.), who has a constituent held in Iran, announced he'd back the deal as well.\n\n\"No one has presented a credible alternative,\" Kildee said."}
{"text": "Darren Hauck/Getty Images\n\nSix months after Election Day, pollsters, Democrats, and much of the press are still trying to figure out what went wrong. How did Donald Trump outperform the polls in enough swing states to swipe an electoral victory Hillary Clinton appeared to have safely in hand? On Tuesday, the Nation offered the latest theory in a never-ending string of them, this one focused on what was by some metrics the single biggest surprise of the election: Trump's victory in Wisconsin, where he trailed in polls by an average of 6.5 points ahead of Nov. 8.\n\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in northeast Ohio.\n\nAccording to new research conducted by data science firm Civis Analytics for liberal super PAC Priorities USA, strict voter ID laws significantly depressed the turnout of black and Democratic-leaning voters in a number of states, chief among them the Badger State. \"Wisconsin's voter-ID law reduced turnout by 200,000 votes, according to the new analysis,\" wrote the Nation's Ari Berman. \"Donald Trump won the state by only 22,748 votes.\" The unstated but implicit conclusion here is that Hillary Clinton would have claimed Wisconsin's 10 electoral votes if it weren't for a state law requiring residents to present a driver's license or another form of government-issued ID to cast a nonprovisional ballot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\nWhile Berman was careful to offer the necessary caveats—the study was conducted by progressives with a partisan interest, the analysis has not been peer-reviewed, etc.—such nuance didn't make its way to social media.\n\nThis headline says it all. Get the facts => https://t.co/oB1WAIvlWG pic.twitter.com/drVU8ayUWE — Priorities USA (@prioritiesUSA) May 9, 2017\n\nBut the Nation headline doesn't say it all—not even close, as a number of political scientists and polling experts were quick to point out.\n\nOne of the first to arrive on the scene with a big bucket of cold water was Eitan Hersh, an assistant professor of political science at Yale University who has studied the effect of voter ID laws.\n\nNo offense, but this is something that is going to be shared hundreds of times and does not meet acceptable evidence standards. https://t.co/4M3ipqiaWg — Eitan Hersh (@eitanhersh) May 9, 2017\n\nThe most glaring problem with the report and how it's being interpreted, Hersh told me by phone, is that the firm behind the analysis decided to operate at a surface level when it almost certainly had the data and expertise to dig much deeper. \"Civis presents itself as a very sophisticated analytics shop,\" Hersh said, \"and yet the analysis they're offering here is rather blunt.\"\n\nThe group relied largely on state-by-state and county-by-county comparisons to reach its conclusions, but it could have—and Hersh maintains, should have—conducted a more granular analysis. Civis could have isolated communities that straddle the border between two states, for instance, or even used a comprehensive voter file to compare similar individuals that do and don't live in states with new voter ID laws. Doing either would have allowed Civis to eliminate variables that may have ultimately skewed its findings. \"It's very weird to do an analysis the way they did when they presumably had a better way to do it,\" Hersh said. \"That's a red flag that jumps out right away.\"\n\nCivis says it mostly limited itself to publicly available information so that its analysis was repeatable; Hersh counters that repeating a flawed analysis will just lead to the same flawed results. As the New York Times' Nate Cohn pointed out on Twitter, and as Hersh echoed in his conversation with me, the absence of a detailed voter file-based analysis of the impact of voter ID laws—by Civis or anyone else for that matter—is in itself telling at this point. \"I would in no way argue that these [voter ID] laws have no effect, but what we've found is that it's a relatively small one,\" Hersh said. Making things more complicated, he added, is that the effect of a voter ID law can be difficult to separate from that of other non-ID-based measures that disenfranchise the same types of people. \"It's just very unlikely that these voter ID laws by themselves would translate into the effect of 200,000 voters,\" Hersh said."}

{"text": "Senior Pentagon officials told Congress on Tuesday that troops are willing to sacrifice portions of their pay and benefits if it means keeping and improving the training and equipment needed to do their jobs.\n\nVice Adm. William F. Moran, chief of naval personnel and deputy chief of naval operations, told lawmakers that sailors he has met with over the past six months have spoken more about \"the quality of the service\" they're able to do than anything other topic.\n\nThe view was shared by other officials, including Sheryl E. Murray, assistant deputy commandant for manpower and reserve affairs for the Marine Corps. \"I would emphasize our Marines do enjoy a good quality of life. Our Marines love being in the Marine Corps family,\" she said. \"Most of all, they want the right equipment. ... They want to be trained, and they want to be ready. That is the overriding desire.\"\n\nPersonnel officials from the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and the Department of Defense met with the House Armed Services' Military Personnel subcommittee to talk about cuts to pay and benefits the Pentagon is proposing for its upcoming budget.\n\nThese include a smaller pay raise -- 1 percent raise, an average 5 percent reduction in housing allowances, and higher health care fees for some retirees.\n\nThe proposed budget for next year is $496 billion, reflecting a savings of $176 billion, according to the Pentagon, because of the personnel cuts.\n\nMilitary leaders say personnel costs make up about a third of their budgets and remain the fasting growing portion. Unless the trend is slowed and reversed, manning costs will eventually make it impossible to meet other funding needs, the military brass has said.\n\n\"That's why we are asking for a 1 percent [troop pay increase] instead of a 2 or higher percentage, so we can slow that growth of a military member's pay and also be able to bolster their readiness and bolster the modernization,\" Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Jessica Wright said.\n\n\"The quality of life is good, but the quality of service, we believe, for our military members is lower, and so we would like to balance that,\" she said.\n\nArmy Deputy Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Howard Bromberg said quality of life is important, but added \"we can't afford to lower the training standards in defense of something else.\"\n\nHowever, the personnel officials who offered testimony before the subcommittee could offer only personal anecdotes to back up their belief that troops would welcome pay and benefit cuts. No survey results were offered. Leaders also said it could not wait for the results of a commission due to issue its report on military pay and benefits next year.\n\nTestimony from the military brass took some lawmakers by surprise after troop advocacy groups have rejected the cuts to pay and benefits proposed in the upcoming budget.\n\nRep. Joe Heck, R-Nev., reminded the Pentagon officials that the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission is expected to turn in its review and recommendation a year from now. He cautioned that they are asking to make significant changes in these areas without the benefit of the commission's findings.\n\n\"What happens when they come back in 2015 with a whole host of recommendations?\" Heck asked.\n\nPentagon officials said the military can't wait a year for the commission's report followed by another year before any recommendations could be adopted.\n\n\"We've got to make a near-term savings in the next couple of years. Otherwise, we're going to dig ourselves into a hole and just not going to be able to get out of it,\" Bromberg said.\n\nVeterans' organizations, which often speak for the services' rank and file, have opposed many of the proposed cuts.\n\nThe veterans groups, including the Association of the U.S. Navy and The American Legion, back a 1.8 percent raise that is tied to the formula worked out by the Employment Cost Index of the Labor Department.\n\n\"You want an adequate standard of living\" for service members, American Legion National Commander Dan Dellinger said Tuesday night. \"That's important for them and their families.\"\n\nDellinger said service members know the fiscal picture is tight. Army exercises have been scaled back. In the Navy, some ships have stayed at home instead of cruising.\n\n\"They've taken those concessions,\" he said. \"I hate to say it, but the government shouldn't try to balance the budget on the backs of service members. If they took away the entire DoD budget, it still wouldn't balance the budget.\"\n\n-- Bryant Jordan can be reached at Bryant.Jordan@monster.com."}
{"text": "Two weeks ago, a group of students at the University of California at Irvine removed a U.S. flag from a common area of the student government suite.\n\nShortly afterwards, six undergraduate members of the Associated Students Council of UCI passed a resolution banning the display of the flags of any nation in the office lobby. The resolution was authored by student Matthew Guevara of the School of Social Ecology.\n\nAmong the reasons the legislative council objected to the American flag were:\n\n--\"The American flag has been flown in instances of colonialism and imperialism.\"\n\n--\"A common ideological understanding of the United States includes American exceptionalism and superiority.\"\n\n--\"Designing a culturally inclusive space is taken seriously by ASUCI.\"\n\n--\"The removal of barriers is the best option at promoting an inclusive space.\"\n\n--\"It is a psychological effect for individuals to identify negative aspects of a space rather than positive ones.\"\n\n--\"Freedom of speech, in a space that aims to be as inclusive as possible can be interpreted as hate speech.\"\n\nTwo days later a higher ranking student panel, the executive cabinet of ASUCI, vetoed the ban.\n\nBut the issue did not end there.\n\nThe hostility that the original legislative council vote engendered -- including, reportedly, death threats -- was used by over a thousand students and dozens of professors as a reason to sign a petition supporting the original ban on the flag.\n\nIn the words of the petition:\n\n\"The resolution recognized that nationalism, including U.S. nationalism, often contributes to racism and xenophobia, and that the paraphernalia of nationalism is in fact often used to intimidate. This is a more or less uncontroversial scholarly point. ...\n\n\"We admire the courage of the resolution's supporters amid this environment of political immaturity and threat, and support them unequivocally.\"\n\nThese are the facts. Now to what I believe is the most important question regarding the resolution to ban the flag and the petition on behalf of the resolution: Why were they supported?\n\nHere are three reasons:\n\n1. Outside of the natural sciences, math, and a few other departments, our universities are essentially seminaries -- teaching what has been the most dynamic religion of the Western world over the past hundred years, leftism. Every -- frequently incoherent -- idea expressed by the resolution and the petition represents years of left-wing indoctrination. Respect for the American flag comes naturally; reasons to hold it in contempt have to be learned.\n\nIt is not surprising that the author of the resolution is a student at UC Irvine's School of Social Ecology. Visit its website and you will see leftism in one of its purest forms.\n\n2. The students and the professors see themselves as citizens of the world. Leftism rejects nationalism, and the most nationalistic of the industrialized Western democracies is America. The left regards nationalism -- as symbolized by hanging or waving the American flag -- as primitive and ultimately fascistic.\n\n3. Many professors and students are bored. Compared to the past anywhere and compared to the present almost anywhere, life in America is remarkably easy for the vast majority of college students and college professors.\n\nThis ease, however, presents them with another problem -- a lack of meaning in life. For nearly all people there has never been a problem with finding meaning. Even putting aside religion -- humanity's greatest supplier of meaning -- life's difficulties have always given people meaning: How will I feed myself and my family? How will I provide myself and my family with a home?\n\nBut these problems exist for almost no American college student and they do not exist for any American professor. And since so few professors, and increasingly few students, derive meaning from America's traditional Judeo-Christian religions, meaning must be sought and found elsewhere.\n\nThus the left generally and the universities in particular manufacture crises that give the secular middle and upper classes great meaning: fight American sexism, intolerance, xenophobia, homophobia, Islamophobia, racism, material inequality, capitalism and nationalism.\n\nThat America is in fact the most open, opportunity-giving and tolerant country in world history is irrelevant to these people. To acknowledge this would be to deprive themselves of the greatest human need after food -- meaning and purpose.\n\nThese are the reasons they want to ban the American flag. That hundreds of thousands of Americans died for what this flag represents -- the American trinity of liberty, In God We Trust and E Pluribus Unum -- means nothing to these students and professors. Thanks to leftism, when they see the American flag they see imperialism and bigotry."}

{"text": "Has Dyson's robotic dream become a reality?\n\nHas Dyson finally cracked its 16-year mission to create a robot vacuum cleaner? The company's teaser video hints at a new release which looks a lot like a rival for the best-selling Roomba, and perfectly illustrates how fast the conditions necessary to create viable robotic products are evolving.\n\nDyson's mysterious video, posted on YouTube (below), heralds a 4 September release. The only piece of information to accompany it reads: '16 years. 200 engineers. £28 million investment. The result? Tell us what you think it is.'\n\nThe device moves around a bit and zooms in and out—interesting, but not as interesting as the glimpse of what looks like its location-analysis technology. It hints at a number of other interesting features too.\n\nWhat's certain is that, with one of the best-known brand names around, Dyson has done its research before going public in a market as hot as robotics is right now.\n\nEarlier this year, the company invested £5m in a lab at Imperial College London designed to help robots 'understand and adapt to the world around them,' Then, in an interview in February, company founder Sir James Dyson (pictured) suggested a robotic cleaner might be in the pipeline and would use computer vision to navigate a room.\n\nImperial's Professor Davison has also spoken about the importance of location tracking: \"We will research and develop systems that allow machines to both understand and perceive their surroundings – using vision to achieve it,\" he said. \"A truly intelligent domestic robot needs to complete complex everyday tasks while adapting to a constantly changing environment.\"\n\nDyson is also planning a £250m expansion of one of its UK sites, at Malmesbury, which could provide up to 3,000 new jobs.\n\nPrime time for consumer robotics\n\nMore than anything, Dyson's upcoming launch proves that consumer robotics is finally ready for prime time. In a great up-sum of why, published on TechCrunch, computer scientists Rudina Seseri and Wan Li Zhu, who both work for VC 's Fairhaven Capital, explain why the conditions now are perfect.\n\n\"In recent years,\" they say, \"we have seen accelerated levels of innovation in both software and hardware that are now driving new possibilities for consumer readiness and adoption of personal robotics.\"\n\nThis as happened on a number of levels:\n\nProliferation of devices, compute, and bandwidth. Instead of requiring expensive custom onboard computing, robots are now able to leverage hardware, smartphones and cloud computing for processing and storage. This has implications on both cost and availability of data for machine perception and learning.\n\nProgress in natural language processing, speech, vision and machine learning – a self-reinforcing loop: As machines can better understand the real world, they learn at a faster rate.\n\nAPI-fication of online services. The ability for machines to tap into multiple online data sources and services allows them to quickly stitch together value, reducing time and cost to go to market. Location-based data, financial and weather, and increasingly healthcare data are all examples.\n\nThey and many others active in the field, also believe that the robotics future won't look much like the current mass-visage of the technology and that, instead, \"artificially intelligent devices will take on a multitude of forms where the form factor will more closely match its functions and use case.\"\n\nMany more will be in the form of embedded intelligence within everyday systems we are already familiar with. And soft robotics further promises to open up the number of applications the technology will have.\n\nThe key, according to Suseri and Zhu, is market acceptance, which will be driven by reliability and safety. In lieu of this, the technology's advance will progress slowly, with interim solutions to pave the way. Cars are in the front line, with incremental modifications such as the sensory-enabled brakes already in the market.\n\nWith a product launch that has many in the industry on the edge of their seats, Dyson is positioning for a leading part in the coming automation of the home and a major slice of the ripening consumer robotics market. It's also an opportunity for a major UK-based company to show some robot muscle.\n\nThis article was originally published on RAS SIG – the Robotics and Autonomous Systems Special Interest Group – part of Innovate UK's Knowledge Transfer Network.\n\nIf you liked this article, you may also be interested in:\n\nSee all the latest robotics news on Robohub, or sign up for our weekly newsletter."}

I'd rather worry about that and prepare for it even if it takes 20 years to come true, than just letting it evolve in a messy way.\"\n\nWhile having a trillion-device life could happen in as little as 10 years, Sangiovanni-Vincentelli said there's a lot of work to be done to get there.\n\nFirst, we simply don't have the network we'd need to support this many connected devices.\n\nWe would need communication protocols that consume very small amounts of energy and can transmit fluctuating amounts of information, the professor explained. Businesses would need to build massive numbers of tiny, inexpensive sensors. We'll need more and better security to fend off hacks to our clothing, walls and brains.\n\nAnd the cloud will have to be grown out to handle all of the data that these trillion devices will create.\n\n\"Once you have the technology enabling all of this, we should be there in 10 years,\" said Sangiovanni-Vincentelli.\n\nWith all of these devices, many people will be anxious about what this means for personal privacy.\n\nSangiovanni-Vincentelli won't be one of them, though.\n\n\"Lack of privacy is not an issue,\" he said. \"We've already lost it all... If the government wants me now, they have me. Everything is already recorded somewhere. What else is there to lose?\"\n\nMelroy also is more excited than nervous about this increasingly digital future.\n\n\"As a technologist, I don't fear technology,\" she said. \"I think having ways that make us healthier and more efficient are a good thing... There is social evolution that happens with technological evolution. We once were worried about the camera and the privacy implications of taking pictures of people. The challenge is to make the pace of change match the social evolution.\""}
{"text": "OTTAWA—Toronto will play host to the first flight of Syrian refugees Thursday, with a military aircraft bringing 150 of the tens of thousands of people set to arrive in the coming months. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he'll be there to welcome the first flight of refugees, scheduled to land at Pearson International Airport just after 9 p.m.\n\nJohn McCallum, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, arrives at the National Press Theatre in Ottawa on Dec. 9 for a news conference to announce details of the plan to resettle 25,000 Syrian refugees in Canada. ( Sean Kilpatrick / THE CANADIAN PRESS ) The Liberals are aiming to bring 10,000 Syrian refugees to Canada by the end of the year and another 15,000 by the end of February. ( Adrian Wyld / THE CANADIAN PRESS )\n\n\"Resettling refugees demonstrates our commitment to Canadians and to the world that Canada understands that we can and must do more,\" Trudeau told the House of Commons. \"It will be a great day.\" RELATED: Sponsorship groups are quiet heroes in helping refugees relocate\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nA second flight is scheduled to arrive at Montreal's Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport on Saturday. While the first two flights will be on military planes, the government expects the remaining flights in December to be private charters. The arrivals will cap off a month of political effort and a massive behind-the-scenes bureaucratic push to make good on the Liberals' pledge to bring in 25,000 Syrian refugees. The government had promised to bring in that number by the end of the year. But after a special cabinet committee led by Health Minister Jane Philpott examined the logistics, the Liberals pushed that deadline back to the end of February 2016. The government still hopes to resettle 10,000 refugees — mostly privately sponsored — by the end of the year, with 15,000 following in the first two months of 2016. Figures released Wednesday morning by Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Canada show that 416 Syrians have arrived in Canada since Nov. 4. A further 1,451 refugees have been issued permanent resident visas, and are awaiting transportation to Canada.\n\nA total of 11,932 applications are currently in process, and funding for resettlement assistance centres has been increased by $3.6 million to \"deal with this huge flow of refugees quite suddenly,\" Immigration Minister John McCallum said Wednesday. Canadian officials believe they've resolved issues with the government of Lebanon over issuing exit visas to refugees — an early roadblock to Ottawa's efforts. McCallum said Canadian officials are interviewing a combined average of 800 people per day at two refugee processing centres in Jordan and Lebanon.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nThe relative speed of processing refugees in those two countries partially offsets significant challenges in Turkey, the third country from which Canada hopes to draw refugees. But officials are still hopeful the federal government can hit its amended targets. \"A certain number of individuals have been identified, but we are not nearly as far advanced in Turkey as in the other countries,\" McCallum admitted in a press conference Wednesday. \"But you see, we never put all our eggs in one basket. We always had three countries with which we were working from the beginning, and if one country produces more, another may produce less, but putting the three together, we are certainly working very hard to realize our targets.\" Part of the challenge is that, unlike Jordan and Lebanon, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is not active on the ground in Turkey, where nearly 2.2 million Syrians live. The UN has been instrumental in Canada's push to bring in Syrians, identifying refugees and referring them to Canadian officials after initial interviews. For the 150 Syrians landing in Toronto Thursday night, the first stop will be a specialized border screening centre run by the CBSA at Pearson's infield terminal. The centre will offer warm clothes and food, as well as a play area for children and space to rest for parents after their day-long journey. The refugees will be given a night's stay in nearby hotels. For privately sponsored refugees, the next day will be their first in the communities that have raised money and resources to welcome them to a new life in Canada. Haidah Amirzadeh, an Iranian refugee who arrived in Canada in 1989, told The Canadian Press that she believes the newly arrived Syrians will quickly find their footing in their new country.\n\n\"I think, especially when somebody has been in such a difficult situation for so long, when they arrive to an opportunity, they really grab onto it,\" Amirzadeh said. \"Nobody wants to be a burden.\" With files from Les Whittington and the Canadian Press\n\nRead more about:"}
{"text": "So on June 7th I was all, 'Facebook, what's happening today?' and as I'm scrolling through my feed I see this picture–posted by a scuba diver from a small group of islands in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean called the Azores–and I know my day is about to get real interesting:\n\nThis is a giant pyrosome, one of the strangest animals on Earth. Over the last few weeks I've been talking with the diver who captured this shot, Devin Leary, and, y'all, there is something very crazy happening in the Azores right now! But first, what are pyrosomes anyway? To quote myself from another article I wrote:\n\n\"If the Borg and the Clone Wars had a baby it would be a pyrosome. One long pyrosome is actually a collection of thousands of clones, with each individual capable of copying itself and adding to the colony. And like members of the Borg, which are mentally connected, pyrosome members are physically connected– actually sharing tissues. And while the Borg live in a big, scary ship, pyrosomes are the big scary ship. The whole colony is shaped like a giant thimble with a point on one end and an opening on the other\"\n\nEach member of the colony sucks in water from the outside of the colony, filters it for food and squirts the filtered water out into the big hollow space in the middle. Pyrosomes can be pretty freaky looking, but like many ocean giants, they're actually filter feeders.\n\nI love hearing about large pyrosome sightings because animals this big are very hard to find. One pyrosome sighting like this is incredibly lucky, but oh it gets so much better. Did you know that right now, all around the Azores, right now…did I say right now? There are pyrosomes ALL OVER THE PLACE?! Many are roughly a meter in length, but some are 8-10 meters (~26-33 feet) long! This is the first time I've been privy to a mass occurrence of giant pyrosomes in real time, and I'm freaking out! And I'm not the only one: Mr. Leary has been on the scene documenting these gentle giants as they troll through the cool waters, and he's never seen anything like this. Devin told me on Facebook that in \"past years I think I've seen one or two but this year we've been seeing multiple per week!\" Even better, this past Sunday Mr. Leary estimates he saw around 50 pyrosomes!\n\nDevin's not the only one. Professor João Pedro Barreiros told me by email that, \"as far as I remember from more than 30 years of continuous diving in the Azores (and this includes literally hundreds of hours searching vast areas freediving) this is the first year that I'm seeing pyrosomes on an almost daily basis!\"\n\nThe first time I saw a pyrosome I nearly cried, and that animals was no bigger than a jellybean. I dream of seeing pyrosomes like this. One diver and marine biology student, Pedro Tomás, told me a few days ago by email that \"the ones we saw this week, one of them I could fit inside.\" OH MY GOSH I WANT TO GO RIGHT NOW.\n\nBut what exactly is happening here? Where are these pyrosomes coming from? Why now? What species? To answer in order: I don't know, I have no idea, haven't got a clue, I think maybe it's Pyrostremma spinosum, but I really have no idea! Mr. Tomás tells me he usually sees a few around this time, but from the sound of it this year is way out of the ordinary.\n\nHow long will this last? Nobody knows. The water in the Azores is starting to warm from all the summer sun, so Mr. Leary is concerned he may not see them for much longer. Dr. Barreiros is collecting observations from other divers, and Mr. Leary is working with Dr. Barreiros to take a few small tissue samples, which can hopefully be used to make an ID based on morphology and DNA sequences.\n\nIn the meantime, if you're in the Azores and want a shot at spotting a pyrosome, I'd suggest getting in touch with Devin Leary and his dive shop, Arraia Divers. And if you've seen a pyrosome, please post your sighting on JellyWatch.org. Maybe with enough reports we can learn something new about these strange and mysterious creatures!"}

A lock of hair was in her pocket. Case History This young woman stepped onto Pacific Coast Highway and was struck first by a Mazda MX-6 and then a Lincoln Continental. She died instantly. When a sketch of her was published in local newspapers, several Huntington Beach residents said they had spoken with her. Her first name may have been Andrea and she may have been from the East Coast. She had no permanent home in Orange County. One of the people who had spoken with her said she claimed to be adopted and was trying to find her real family. She said she was from somewhere like Virginia. She told another person she was from New York. She claimed that she was 25 or 26. But she appeared to be as young as 16. Her parents, she claimed, were pretty well-known, but she didn't divulge who they were. She had been adopted at a very young age. She didn't have any type of identification. \"Andrea\" also spent a night at the home of a mobile-home salesman who took pity on the homeless woman who had little clothing and no money. The family fed her, let her use the back bedroom and gave her some money. \"Andrea\" apparently took the money and bought clothes at a Goodwill store, including a pair of shoes for $19.95. She was wearing the pink shoes with the price tags still on when she was struck on the highway. The salesman said the morning \"Andrea\" left his house, she cut off some of her hair and put it on her finger. UPDATE: On May 4, 2017, she was positively identified as 26-year-old Andrea Kuiper of Fairfax, Virginia. She had traveled to California to find her biological family.

{"text": "Flip Saunders couldn't win.\n\nYou simply cannot trade a superstar, an elite talent and get equal value back.\n\nKevin Love is an elite talent (if you don't see that it speaks to your hoops IQ) and he was forcing a trade — Love wasn't coming back and everyone around the league knew it. That wasn't Saunders' fault — it was all the previous GM David Kahn who screwed up picks to put players around Love (drafting Jonny Flynn over Stephen Curry and Wesley Johnson over DeMarcus Cousins) then insulting Love by not giving him a five-year max rookie contract extension — but Saunders could not repair the relationship. It was too far gone.\n\nBy the time of the playoffs and Finals this summer Love's agent was working hard to get his client out of Minnesota and to a destination of his choosing, using he hammer of where he would and would not re-sign after this current deal is up. That started the build up.\n\nBy the time of the draft in June there a buzz and the feeling of pressure — the naive on twitter and some talking heads said, \"Saunders needs to trade Love right now, the market is never going to get better.\" But teams were low-balling Minnesota, thinking there really was pressure and they wanted to get the deal done sooner rather than later.\n\nSo Saunders walked away. He was patient. He knew the low-ball offers would always be there, he could wait for better.\n\nIn any negotiation, the guy with the power is the guy more willing to walk away from the table. Saunders was that guy. He took a page out of Masai Ujiri's book when he had the same situation with Carmelo Anthony in Denver — be patient, let a trade market really develop, wait for someone to give you something you really want.\n\nBetter offers did come in, slowly. Chicago came in with Taj Gibson, Jimmy Butler and future picks, but that was not enough. The Celtics had a nice package of potential picks and young players, but Minnesota wasn't ready to go that route.\n\nThen the Warriors came in with a tempting offer but Saunders held out for their most prized rookie contract — Klay Thompson. Golden State wouldn't do it. A team who has great former shooting guards in key decision making positions — consultant/owner Jerry West and coach Steve Kerr — did not want to give up on Thompson and pairing him with Curry. So Saunders waited.\n\nEventually, Cleveland threw Andrew Wiggins in a package. Most likely because LeBron James told them to — part of the reason he returned to Cleveland is he and his guys have a lot more power in the organization there. Once Cleveland got LeBron back they became a win-now team and Love fits that better than the developing Wiggins. Credit LeBron for being a smart GM here.\n\nNow the Wiggins for Love deal is set, it just can't be executed until Aug. 23.\n\nBut that worked for Saunders. If not an outright win, it was as close to it as he would get.\n\nSaunders got what he needed — a potential elite player back. We don't know how good Wiggins is going to turn out to ultimately be — he is incredibly talented but has a long ways to go — but Saunders got a young player who at the very least will be part of the future core of this team. If not it's leader and cornerstone. And he got a guy on a rookie deal that he can control for a while (Wiggins will eventually sign some kind of rookie contract extension in Minnesota and likely be there at least seven years, maybe more).\n\nSaunders also got Anthony Bennett, a former No. 1 pick who will never live up to that billing but showed at Las Vegas Summer League this year he can become a solid rotation big in the NBA. And he got a future first round pick.\n\nCombine that with the potential of Zach LaVine (athletic but a lot farther to go in terms of game feel than Wiggins), plus the still young Ricky Rubio and others you might have something to build on in Minnesota. Saunders will look to move players of some value for assets now — J.J. Barea, Alexey Shved and others — and start to build for the future. In the deep West there is no reason for them to get vets and try to get the eight seed, rebuild the right way. It's about player development in Minnesota.\n\nBut the key part of rebuilding is getting the cornerstone piece, and Saunders got that.\n\nSaunders couldn't win, but he played this all about as well as one can. He deserves a nice golf clap for that."}

{"text": "Before we get into the deliciousness above, let me thank you all for making this year's NEDA week post—sharing your ED story with a partner or friend—so lovely. I appreciated all of the comments, especially those from people who are just on the brink of sharing with their partners. I hope you all find strength and support in the CR community! NEDA week is still up and running, so please keep these issues fresh in your minds. And, fellow bloggers, let me know if you write NEDA posts of your own!\n\nI don't think I have to say too much about the deliciousness above. Guacamole. Sweet potatoes. Sweet potatoes grilled with a spice rub. What more could one ask for, except seconds and thirds? Seriously, sweet potatoes are one of my favorite foods: they're one of the more healthy and natural ways to get your carb attack on, and their sweetness gives them tremendous versatility. They're standard dinner fare for me, but I can easily eat them for breakfast, as we all just learned when I posted my sweet potato breakfast salad with almond butter protein dressing:\n\nToday's recipe is quick and easy, but it's also an impressive appetizer dish to share at parties or as a first course for dinner at home. I grilled my sweet potato rounds on my Cuisinart indoor grill/griddle (this year's holiday request), but baking them will work every bit as nicely. And of course, if you have an outdoor grill, have at it. Grilling sweet potatoes brings out their caramel flavors, and it's a great opportunity to crack out a spicy, smoky mixture of seasonings.\n\nChili-Rubbed Sweet Potato Rounds with Guacamole (vegan, gluten free, soy free)\n\nServes 4\n\nFor the chili spice rub:\n\n2 tbsps chili powder\n\n1 tsp paprika (I use regular here, but use smoked paprika if you want a smoky flavor!)\n\n1 tsp coriander\n\n1/2 tsp cinnamon\n\n1/2 tsp sea salt\n\nDash cayenne pepper (omit if you don't want the heat)\n\nFor the dish:\n\n1 large sweet potato, sliced into 1/4 inch rounds\n\nCoconut oil (optional)\n\n1 recipe classic Choosing Raw guacamole\n\n1) If you're baking your sweet 'taters, pre-heat oven to 425 degrees. If you're grilling them, first prepare a pot of boiling water with a steamer insert.\n\n2) Mix spices together for the rub.\n\n3) Oven method: Brush or spray potatoes lightly with coconut oil (you can omit this if you're avoiding oils). Sprinkle them with the spice rub. Roast round for about 12-15 minutes, or until golden on the bottoms. Flip and roast for another 12-15 minutes.\n\nGrill method: Steam sweet potato rounds for about eight minutes–you don't want them cooked through, but you do want them to be most of the way there. Remove from steam heat, spray or brush lightly with coconut oil (totally optional), dust with chili rub, and transfer to grill. Grill for about 4-5 minutes on each side, until nicely browned.\n\n4) Whip up a batch of classic CR guacamole. Transfer it to a plastic bag, and snip one corner of the bag so that you can pipe out the guac (I almost wrote \"pipette out\" the guac–too much biochem lab).\n\nPipe the guac onto the rounds as if you were frosting cupcakes. (NB: My guac didn't look much better after piping than it might have if I'd used a spoon. So this step, while nice, is definitely optional).\n\n5) Serve, savor, swoon.\n\nThe light, bright, lemony guacamole pairs perfectly with the dense, sweet, and smoky sweet potatoes in this scrumptious recipe. Added bonus? Lots of complex carbs and healthy fat make this an incredibly satiating—as well as a supremely delicious—snack or appetizer.\n\nHealthy, simple, and satisfying. The best kind of party food.\n\nHope you keep this recipe in mind for either winter or summer entertaining; one of its benefits is that it features produce from both seasons, and it's very versatile!\n\nWith that, it's back to a long day of biochem lab and Orgo reports. Happy hump night.\n\nxo"}
{"text": "The Shifting Legacy Of The Man Who Shot Franz Ferdinand\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Historical Archives Sarajevo/AP Historical Archives Sarajevo/AP\n\nA hundred years ago Saturday, Gavrilo Princip shot the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne. That event triggered World War I, charting the course for the 20th century. Today, the legacy of the Bosnian Serb nationalist remains the subject of intense debate — nowhere more than in Sarajevo itself.\n\nIn the one-room museum on the corner where the assassination took place, tour guide Mirsad Nazerovic points to a black-and-white photo of a pillar that used to stand outside this building. It was a monument with a very short life.\n\n\"Construction started in 1916. It was finished in 1917. And it was destroyed in 1918,\" says Nazerovic.\n\nThat was the first in a long string of short-lived memorials to the assassination.\n\n\"The question you're faced with is very stark,\" says historian James Lyon, an expert in Balkan history. \"Was Gavrilo Princip a terrorist, or was he a national hero? There have been tug-of-war interpretations, and they have changed over time.\"\n\nLyon runs through about a half-dozen monuments that have been erected on this site, built up and torn down with each change in power.\n\nThere was a plaque in the 1930s that said Princip fired shots expressing the longing of people to be free. It was removed when the Germans arrived.\n\nThen World War II ended, and a plaque went up noting that this was \"where Gavrilo Princip threw off the German occupiers,\" says Lyon, \"obviously with references to the recent war in mind.\"\n\nFor a while, there were footprints in the sidewalk where tourists could stand in Princip's shoes. Those were torn out during the Balkan war in the 1990s.\n\nToday, a resolutely apolitical plaque stands on the corner of where the assassination took place. It reads: \"From this place on 28 June 1914, Gavrilo Princip assassinated the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sofia.\"\n\nAnd this isn't the only place where the battle over Princip's legacy is raging.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ari Shapiro/NPR Ari Shapiro/NPR\n\nA visit to Princip's grave requires a taxi ride outside of the town center. The site doesn't look like a historic place of consequence. People sell used books outside the cemetery fence. There's a grungy cafe, and a highway overpass casts a shadow on the graves.\n\nInside, Princip and most of his co-conspirators are buried in a small chapel. He died in prison after being convicted of the assassination. Some of the others were executed.\n\nHistorian Edin Hajdarpasic of Loyola University says the inscription on the chapel refers to the assassins as heroes.\n\n\"And above it is a citation from the Montenegrin poet Njegos,\" says Hajdarpasic. \"And it reads: 'Blessed is he who lives forever. He had something to be born for.' \"\n\nNot what one would think of as the grave of a villain. Instead, says Hajdarpasic, \"it has hero written all over it.\"\n\nIn every era, people with power have tried to use this assassin as a symbol. The meaning of the symbol changes depending on who's talking.\n\nEven Hollywood got in on the act. The real Princip was a scrawny, malnourished guy.\n\nBut in the 1975 movie The Day That Shook the World, he's a smoldering heartthrob who murmurs to a gorgeous woman, \"Try to understand. I must do it.\"\n\nTo people with firsthand experience of the assassination, this all seems very odd. Haaris Pasovic is a theatrical director in Sarajevo.

{"text": "June 3, 2015\n\nLarge Majority of Americans—Including Gun Owners—Support Stronger Gun Safety Policies\n\nFollow-up to survey conducted following Sandy Hook shooting shows support for gun safety policies remains strong\n\nA large majority of Americans – including gun owners – continue to support stronger policies to prevent gun violence than are present in current federal and most state law, according to a new national public opinion survey conducted by researchers with the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research at the Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nThe survey is a follow-up to one conducted by the same researchers in early 2013, shortly after the shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut that left 26 dead.\n\nThe results are published online in Preventive Medicine.\n\n\"Two years after the tragedy in Newtown, our study of public support for two dozen specific gun policies found a large majority of Americans continue to favor a range of gun-safety policies,\" says lead study author Colleen Barry, PhD, MPP, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \"Support was strongest – with little difference between gun-owners and non-owners – for universal background checks, barring people with temporary restraining orders for domestic violence from having guns and stronger regulations of licensed gun dealers.\"\n\nSupport for requiring background checks for all gun sales remained high, with 85 percent of gun owners and 83 percent of non-owners favoring the policy. In the 2013 survey, 84 percent of gun owners and 90 percent of non-owners supported background checks for all gun sales. Support for banning assault weapons among all respondents decreased from 69 percent in 2013 to 63 percent in 2015, and support for banning the sale of large capacity ammunition magazines decreased from 68 percent to 60 percent. Notably, the small erosion in support for these policies occurred almost entirely among non-gun-owners.\n\nThe 2015 national survey was conducted two years from the date the 2013 survey was fielded, and used the same sampling approach and survey research firm, GfK. The latest survey included 1,326 respondents, while 2013 survey included 2,703 participants.\n\nMore than 11,000 people in the United States are killed each year as a result of gun homicides, and the firearm homicide rate in the U.S. is seven times higher than in the average high-income country.\n\n\"The extraordinarily high rate of gun violence in the U.S. is due in large part to weaknesses in our standards for legal gun ownership and laws to hold individuals accountable if they put guns into the wrong hands,\" says study author Daniel Webster, ScD, MPH, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. \"Yet when we poll Americans, we see strong support even among gun owners for stricter standards and increased accountability.\"\n\nIn the 2015 survey, the majority of gun owners surveyed support prohibiting a person convicted of a serious crime as a juvenile from having a gun for 10 years (73 percent), prohibiting people who have been convicted of public display of gun in a threatening manner excluding self-defense from having a gun for 10 years (75 percent), and prohibiting people convicted of domestic violence from having a gun for 10 years (76 percent).\n\nSimilarly, the majority of gun owners (67 percent) also support allowing cities to sue licensed gun dealers when the gun dealer's sales practices allow criminals to obtain guns and requiring a mandatory minimum sentence of two years in prison for a person convicted of knowingly selling a gun to someone who cannot legally have one (71 percent).\n\n\"All too often, pollsters ask Americans whether they support more or less gun control, or frame gun policies as controls on gun ownership generally rather than as measures to keep guns from criminals or other high-risk groups,\" Barry says. \"When you drill down to specific policies, you see that Americans are very much in support of common-sense regulations to keep their families and communities safe from gun violence.\"\n\n\"Two years after Newtown—public opinion on gun policy revisited\" was written by Colleen Barry, PhD, MPP, Emma Beth McGinty, PhD, MS, Jon Vernick, JD, MPH and Daniel Webster, ScD, MPH.\n\nThe research was supported by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg Philanthropies.

{"text": "The likelihood that California will legalize cannabis is rising in the final weeks of the Proposition 64 campaign, thanks to strong political donations, limited opposition funding, and few negative October surprises.\n\nAccording to filings with the Secretary of State's Office, legalization initiative Proposition 64's supporters have raised $19.7 million. The financial report may be the most accurate yet, because it excludes \"contributions in earlier election cycles and contributions between allied committees,\" which otherwise inflate raw sums by millions of dollars. The main Yes on 64 committee has raised about $15 million, while affiliated groups raised the rest. No on 64 groups have raised just $2.5 million.\n\nExperts have long said it could take $20 million to legalize cannabis in California, if the drive did not face major opposition. By that metric, the legalization push now appears to be on target.\n\nThat amount raised for California jibes with the cost of legalization in states such as Colorado, Washington, and Oregon. It can cost about a $1 to $2 per vote to pass the measures. It cost about $1.50 in Colorado, insiders there say. Colorado legalization received about 1.38 million votes and approximately $2 million was spent.\n\nCalifornia had 17.9 million registered voters, as of May 2016, according to Public Policy Institute of California.\n\nA record 57 percent of Americans now support marijuana legalization, a new Pew Poll stated on October 12. That number has been holding steady for the last few years.\n\nDriving out the vote is another matter. Those that go to the polls most — like white seniors — are the demographic opposite of the most ardent legalization supporters, including youth voters. The Yes on Prop 64 campaign is deploying its cash to target those voters online and in TV ads.\n\n\"This is California, and any serious campaign invests most of its resources communicating to voters through paid and online media\" stated Jason Kinney for Yes on 64.\n\nVeteran initiative-runner Bill Zimmer, who is working on Prop. 62 to abolish the death penalty said the likelihood of Prop. 64 success is \"overwhelming.\"\n\n\"It's overkill [in my humble opinion],\" stated Dale Gieringer, who directs California NORML. \"I've been predicting this would be a slam dunk ever since Colorado and Washington legalized in 2012, and I don't see any reason to change my opinion.\"\n\nOpponents may be out of time to depress support for the measure, barring some tectonic political event.\n\nZimmerman said campaign funding can sway obscure campaigns. \"But when the issue is familiar to voters, and those voters have already formed an opinion, the amount of money each side spends is not as dominating a factor,\" he explained.\n\nProp. 64 has consistently been polling in the high fifties. But voters still have time to read their voter guides and reject legalization, said Andrew Acosta, director of No on 64, in an email.\n\n\"We would never be able to match the money from the marijuana industry, who see this as investment in the biggest market in America,\" Acosta wrote. \"Voters are just now receiving their ballots and they will have a good chance to see that this initiative is much more of a business plan than it is a social justice movement.\"\n\nHowever, state data show Prop. 64's money mostly comes from social-interest donors.\n\nProp. 64 ends pot prohibition for adults 21 or older that are using, gifting and growing personal amounts. It also regulates cannabis commerce. The roughly $10 billion legal industry could generate $1 billion in tax revenue, to be spent on consumer protections as well as mitigating pot and prohibition's impacts on sensitive groups and communities, such as kids and wildlands.\n\nTechnologist turned philanthropist Sean Parker pitched in $9 million, as part of spending on a wide range of efforts including $250 million to fight cancer. Parker's spokespeople have said he has no ties or plans to enter the cannabis industry.\n\nThe other biggest donor is the Drug Policy Alliance, which over the last few decades has emerged as the leading drug law reform group in America. DPA has championed the total decriminalization of all drug use. This \"health-first\" approach is rapidly being adopted by the U.S. government, and several medical groups, including the California Medical Association, which endorsed Prop 64.\n\nAnd Prop. 64 is clinching key endorsements up and down the state, from the likes of major newspapers, to the appearances on Democratic Party mailers, to Republican Rep. Tom McClintock, who said that he supports legalization because it \"takes the criminal profit out of the equation.\""}

{"text": "by\n\nThere are so many areas of conventional democratic governance being challenged or eliminated by the Stephen Harper wrecking crew it is hard to keep up. Those searching for a line in the sand that even this government won't cross still haven't found it. So far, it seems, there is nothing (save the military and prisons) that is sacrosanct.\n\nMinimally, all governments take seriously the protection of their citizens; otherwise there is scarcely any point in having one. Yet recent reports reveal that that the Harper government has virtually eliminated monitoring of the ozone layer over Canada. The government has shut down four of five very sophisticated monitoring stations leaving only a single station – at UBC in Vancouver – still gathering information about this critical aspect of our environment.\n\nIn doing so, Canada is once again demonstrating that it is becoming a rogue state. It has already established this reputation by walking away from its Kyoto commitments. The monitoring of the ozone layer – which protects the earth from harmful radiation – is an international task requiring the co-operation of many countries. Canada, because of it enormous territory and its large share of the Arctic where the ozone layer is most threatened – is absolutely key to global monitoring. Last week, according to CBC TV's Environmental Unit , \"…five scientists from high-profile U.S. universities and NASA released a scathing critique of Canada's cuts to its ozone monitoring, saying it is jeopardizing the world's ability to watch for holes in the ozone layer and pollutants high in the atmosphere.\"\n\nBut beyond the contempt shown for the international community, the deliberate sabotage of ozone monitoring again demonstrates two of the most prominent features of the Harper government: its disdain and even hostility towards science (and its own scientists) and its determination to promote the oil industry and protect it from any possible criticism.\n\nIt is not just ozone monitoring that has been gutted. In a response to the revelation Environment Canada acknowledged that other pollutants-monitoring was also being downgraded: \"The number of staff in measurement activities for the monitoring of ozone, tropospheric pollution and atmospheric transport of toxic chemicals has remained constant but their work now includes other departmental priorities.\"\n\nTropospheric pollution is essentially pollution particles caused by combustion – industrial, automobile, forest fires, etc. – the kind of pollution that is the most dangerous to human health.\n\nThe same day that the revelations about the Conservatives' cuts to pollution monitoring were published, an article in the New York Times reported on several new studies that revealed living in polluted air is even more hazardous to your health than previously thought. One study found that air breathed by most Americans (it's hardly any different in Canadian cities) \"…greatly accelerates declines in measures of memory and attention span.\" A study in Boston concluded that the odds of having a stroke increased by 30 per cent even on days when pollution was classified as moderate – a category that is supposed to suggest minimal danger to health. It went up to 60% for bad pollution days and the effects were almost immediate – within 12-14 hours.\n\nA study published in the American Journal of Medicine revealed that common pollutants – carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide – \"…raised a person's immediate risk of suffering a heart attack..\", increasing heart rates and thickening the blood, accelerating the development of atherosclerosis.\n\nWhy would any government deliberately take steps that they know will make it more difficult to protect the health of its citizens? A health Canada report published in 2005 concluded that 6,000 people a year in Canada died as a direct result of air pollution and that the health costs of that pollution were a billion dollars a year.\n\nBut the Harper government's priority is not the health of Canadians or the quality of the air we breathe and the water we drink. Its single-minded purpose is to promote the oil industry and protect it from any criticism. Demonizing critics of the tar sands as enemies of the country is just one small part of that goal. Eliminating scientific data that could link the oil industry to negative health effects is another. Why else would the government stop monitoring for pollution?\n\nIf the message is giving you trouble, shoot the messengers. That's exactly what Harper has done and will continue to do in his March budget. Last fall Environment Canada announced that some 700 scientists and researchers would be losing their jobs. Sixty were fired in January.\n\nMURRAY DOBBIN, now living in Powell River, BC has been a journalist, broadcaster, author and social activist for over forty years.

Hopefully we will never have to use this power, but there will never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in the world!\"\n\nTrump's remarks have come under criticism from members of both parties.\n\nSenate Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Jack Reed (D-R.I.) said Wednesday that the \"fire and fury\" remark was not helpful in defusing the North Korea threat compared to \"smart, steady leadership and stronger diplomatic ties with our key allies.\"\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters on Wednesday that Trump was seeking to send a \"strong message\" to North Korea that the United States was prepared to defend itself and its allies.\n\nNorth Korea has responded to the remarks from the Trump administration with its own tough rhetoric. On Tuesday, it suggested it could launch an attack on Guam.\n\nNorth Korea would have the capability to devastate much of South Korea in any military exchange with the United States. This knowledge has been a deterrent on any use of force against Pyongyang.\n\nMattis said Trump \"was informed of the growing threat last December and on taking office his first orders to me emphasized the readiness of our ballistic missile defense and nuclear deterrent forces.\"\n\nMattis's full statement:\n\n\"The United States and our allies have the demonstrated capabilities and unquestionable commitment to defend ourselves from an attack.

{"text": "There is an image from the yesterday's nightmare in Boston which I cannot get out of my mind, probably because it's at once both horrific and holy. As first responders ran towards the victims of the bombing, the \"cruel irony,\" as reporter Charles Pierce put it, was that \"the barricades meant to protect the spectators briefly prevented the EMTs from reaching the injured.\" I see the footage, and I can almost sense their desperation, knowing that people need help, and that mere seconds can be the difference between life and death. And yet I'm filled with awe. Just who are these people, doing the holiest thing a human being can do: running towards the injured and dead instead of running away from them.\n\nThere is something about seeing first responders going about their work that restores our hope in humanity. Just as importantly, there is something about seeing them that can teach us a lesson in theology.\n\nIn Jewish theology, the highest human ideal is to \"walk in God's ways.\" The Book of Deuteronomy mentions this lofty mandate five times, but curiously, it never spells out what it means. Modern Bible scholars tend to think that \"walking in God's ways\" is just another way of talking about obeying God's commandments, but the Talmudic Sages understood it differently. Their interpretation is something I suspect many first responders understand in an intuitive, almost visceral way—which is why, from a Jewish perspective, they are theological heroes.\n\nWhat does being godly consist of, according to the rabbis? A well-known Talmudic text puts it this way: \"Just as God clothes the naked, so should you; just as God visited the sick, so should you; just as God comforted the mourners, so should you; and just as God buried the dead, so should you\" (Sotah 14a). To walk in God's ways, in other words, is to act in the ways that the Torah describes God as acting. Just as God is present when people are vulnerable and suffering, so should we be.\n\nYes, for religious people, study is important, prayer is important, and ritual, too. But what this text, and others like it, suggests is this: If you want to really serve God, and not just go through the motions, then learn to care for people in moments of profound pain. In many ways, it is easier to study, or pray, or build a sukkah—or whatever. In telling us that offering care and comfort to people in pain is the very highest human ideal, Judaism alerts us to the fact that it can be intensely hard work. But it is also the heart of authentic religion and spirituality: To bring a little bit of God's love and compassion to the widow, the orphan, the Alzheimer's patient, and the bombing victim.\n\nNotice something about the Talmud's list. The naked are vulnerable, but their situation is reversible; the sick are vulnerable, but at least sometimes they can heal. Mourners have sustained an immense loss; nothing can bring back their loved ones. And the dead are… dead, and never coming back. Their situation is the very paradigm of irreversibility. Each situation the Talmud invokes is more irreversible than the one before, and hence, I think, also more frightening. Yes, the Talmud appears to be saying, these people's circumstances are scary. Stay with them instead of fleeing.\n\nFaced with a situation that makes us stare the depth and extent of out vulnerability in the face, most of us want to flee. Here, then, is Judaism's message: You want to serve God? Run towards the very people and places you most want to run away from. You want to be religious? Learn to be present for other people when they are in pain. All the rest is commentary.\n\nThis is what first responders do. Without calling attention to themselves or congratulating themselves, they run towards human suffering instead of running away from it. To walk in God's ways is to walk in their ways, too—towards people in pain and not away from them.\n\nIn the days ahead, let's appreciate and thank the first responders—yes. But let's also ask: How can we internalize something of their ethos, and their capacity for courage and compassion and care? We can pay them no greater tribute than that. And we can offer God no greater service either.\n\nRabbi Shai Held is co-founder, dean and chair in Jewish thought at Mechon Hadar.

{"text": "A pilot from Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), Pakistan's national carrier, is being investigated for potentially putting the lives of more than 305 passengers at risk by allegedly allowing a trainee pilot to fly the aircraft soon after take-off while he reportedly took a nap in a passenger seat last month, according to a passenger on board the flight.\n\nCaptain Amir Akhtar Hashmi was reported to be operating London-bound flight PK-785 from Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, on April 26 along with first officer pilot Ali Hassan Yazdani, and another first officer - Mohammad Asad Ali - who was being trained by Mr Hashmi, according to Dawn, the Pakistani daily newspaper.\n\nDuring the flight, Mr Hashmi allegedly left Mr Ali in control of the plane while Mr Yazdani was in the observer's seat of the cockpit. The captain reportedly then went over to a business class seat where he put a blanket over himself and went to sleep.\n\nMr Hashmi has denied that he slept during the flight: \"It is a wrong allegation that I took a two-and-a-half hour sleep during the flight. I did not sleep during the said flight,\" he told the Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency.\n\nThe captain allegedly left a trainee pilot in control of the plane in the cockpit (not pictured) while he took a nap Credit: Getty\n\nThe captain also claimed that it is normal practice for a pilot to take naps during long flights in the presence of co-pilots, according to PTI.\n\nThe incident allegedly would have gone unnoticed had it not caught the attention of a flier who saw Mr Hashmi sleeping in a passenger's seat in full uniform. After realising who Mr Hashmi was, the concerned passenger was said to have made a complaint and a senior air hostess was reportedly forced to make note of the incident in her flight log.\n\nLives of over 305 passengers put at risk; investigation underway https://t.co/BVymkefnx5 pic.twitter.com/yR4WuXal37 — Dawn.com (@dawn_com) May 7, 2017\n\n\"Passenger (Seat 1 D) complained that while the captain was sleeping in business class cabin, I (the passenger) do not feel safe. It had been explained that two other crew members were in the cockpit but he said that he would follow the matter and write down a complaint card as well,\" senior air hostess Nazneen Haider stated in her report.\n\nMr Hashmi was taken off flight duty with an investigation under way, PIA spokesperson Danyal Gilani told Dawn, who did not disclose any further details regarding the incident.\n\nBoth first officers allegedly did not report the incident to management in a bid to protect Mr Hashmi, who is paid Rs100,000 (around £735) a month to train pilots and is the former president of the Pakistan Air Lines Pilots Association (PALPA).\n\nThe airline allegedly delayed launching an investigation but eventually gave in to \"pressure from above\" among ministry officials in the capital.\n\nIt is unclear whether both first officers as well as Ms Haider would also be investigated for the alleged incident and whether the first officers have also been or will be taken off flying duty.\n\nThe latest incident isn't the first time Mr Hashmi has allegedly compromised passengers' safety during a flight. During his time as president of the PALPA, the pilot allegedly operated many long-haul transatlantic flights without resting for the prescribed duration of time before the journey, Dawn reports.\n\nBoth PIA and the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) have yet to respond to Telegraph Travel's request for a comment on the latest allegations, including whether there will be any actions taken against Mr Hashmi, his co-pilots and the senior air hostess for the alleged safety breaches made and whether any measures will be taken to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\nTelegraph Travel has also asked both PIA and PCAA about what pilots and cabin crew are required to do during such incidents, and what amount of time pilots are required to rest before operating a flight, but have yet to receive a response from either company.\n\nEarlier this year, PIA was also investigated for breaching safety regulations by allegedly allowing seven people to travel while standing on a flight from Karachi to Medina, Saudi Arabia in January.\n\nThe situation would have posed a serious risk to passengers as those standing would not have had access to oxygen masks in the case of an in-flight emergency and would have contributed to overcrowding on the plane in the case of an emergency evacuation."}
{"text": "The day has arrived. Rather than stress out about the game too early, let's have some fun with another preview. One of the smaller, but more interesting battles during the NLDS will be that between Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina behind the plate and Dee Gordon on the bases. We all saw the kind of difference a running game can make in a playoff game earlier this week. However, Yadier Molina is no Derek Norris, who was catching for the A's while the Royals were running wild during the AL play-in game.\n\nMolina has thrown out 45% of the baserunners who have tried to run on him through his career, well above the league average caught stealing rate of 28%. He has also faced off against Dee Gordon a few times in the past, so let's take a look back:\n\nAttempt 1: 9/13/12\n\nGordon entered the game as a pinch runner after Luis Cruz reached on an error. The pitcher, Edward Mujica, threw a splitter which is not necessarily an easy pitch for a caught stealing. However, Molina threw an absolute dart to second. It took a perfect throw to get Gordon, and the throw was perfect. Relievers don't generally do a great job of holding runners on, but Mujica has been relatively good at limiting the running game, even while away from the Cardinals. Given Gordon's jump, Molina deserves most of the credit.\n\nAttempt 2: 9/15/12\n\nThis was another pinch running appearance for Gordon, this time with Jason Motte on the mound. As the GIF shows, the pitch was 95, and in a decent place for Molina to make a throw. Gordon was ruled safe, but…\n\nGood thing for the Dodgers that this was before replay review was implemented, because was clearly out. The missed call led to a Dodger victory on a Juan Rivera walk-off single two batters later. Hah, Juan Rivera. Remember him?\n\nMotte has allowed a league average stolen base success rate while mostly pitching in front of Molina, so he isn't exactly great at holding runners on. It didn't change the result here.\n\nAttempt 3: 9/16/12\n\nTrevor Rosenthal has pitched nearly 170 innings at the big league level. This Dee Gordon caught stealing (again, on a late innings pinch run appearance) was one of six times anybody has even attempted to steal against Rosenthal. This was Molina's worst throw of the four attempts, but Gordon's jump wasn't great and Daniel Descalso deserves some credit for a fast tag.\n\nAttempt 4: 6/29/14\n\nDue to a combination of Molina injuries and a lack of playing time, the next rematch wasn't until earlier this year. This time, the pitcher was Shelby Miller, currently slated to start game four of this series. Like Motte, Miller allows about a league average stolen base success rate, even with Molina behind the dish for most of that span. Gordon got a great jump, but the Cardinals pitched out. Gordon was so fast that Molina's great throw barely got him.\n\n—\n\nOverall, Dee Gordon has attempted four stolen bases against Yadier Molina in 15 \"stolen base chances\" (on base with second or third base open in front of him). That's a 27% attempt rate, which is a bit lower than Gordon's career attempt rate of 35%. Already, Molina has limited Gordon's running game before using his arm.\n\nOf the four attempts, Dee was caught three times. He was \"safe\" (actually out) once. That's a 25% (0%) success rate, compared to Gordon's career success rate of 77%. If we go by what should have been called, Dee has been out all four times he has attempted to steal against Molina, which is pretty incredible.\n\nIn order to maintain a positive contribution to overall offensive output, the break-even point for stealing bases (without including leverage) is a 2/3 success rate (as in, if a runner steals 66.6% successfully, his net stolen base runs output will be zero). Gordon's past four attempts against Molina aren't really a predictor of his future success rate, which will probably be closer to Molina's 48% caught stealing rate (despite Gordon's speed, he still steals around the league average rate, even this year). With a large enough sample, it's tough to imagine Gordon hitting the 2/3 threshold. Basically, if Gordon doesn't have a perfect read on a pitcher, he should not go. Depending on Molina to make a mistake would be, well, a mistake."}

The boy is separated from adult offenders and is being constantly supervised, CNN affiliate WBRE reported\n\nThe boy admitted to grabbing a wooden cane, holding it against 90-year-old Helen Novak's throat for several seconds and punching her in the throat and stomach, according to the police affidavit.\n\nKurilla told police he was angry at Novak because she had yelled at him when he entered her room. He said he wanted to ask her a question.\n\nWere you trying to kill her? the trooper asked the boy.\n\n\"No, I was only trying to hurt her,\" Kurilla replied, according to the affidavit.\n\nThe boy was ordered to be held without bail after his arraignment and is set to appear in court October 22.\n\nBernie Brown, his lawyer, said he was petitioning the court to get the fifth-grade Damascus Elementary School student out of jail, WBRE reported.\n\n\"Tristen really kind of doesn't have an idea of what is going on,\" Brown told the station.\n\nBrown added, \"Jail is still jail, no matter what part of the facility you are in.\"\n\nBrown also can petition a judge to transfer the case to juvenile court.\n\nJanine Edwards, Wayne County district attorney, said Pennsylvania law made it mandatory \"that a criminal homicide charge be first directly filed in adult court by the prosecutor regardless of the age of the perpetrator,\" WBRE reported.\n\n\"It is not a choice I made,\" she told the station, adding that a juvenile detention center will not accept a child charged with homicide. \"It's not a choice the warden made. It's not a choice Pennsylvania State Police made.\"\n\nThe age of the defendant was unusual, she told the station.\n\n\"That's not something I've seen,\" she said. \"I'm not sure how many times that's been seen in Pennsylvania or not.\"\n\nPolice were initially called to the home of Kurilla's grandfather, Anthony Virbitsky, in Damascus Township on Saturday morning with a report that an elderly woman had died there, the affidavit said. Virbitsky was the woman's caretaker, authorities said.\n\nThe county coroner responded to the home, found Novak's body and transported it to the morgue, the affidavit stated.\n\nA few hours later, the boy's mother, Martha Virbitsky, appeared at the state police post with her son and told Trooper John Decker that the boy had confessed to killing Novak, the affidavit said.\n\nThe boy's mother told police that she \"has had a lot of trouble with Tristen and that he has some mental difficulties\" and had been violent in the past, the affidavit said.\n\nKurilla had told his grandfather that Novak was bleeding from the mouth, but denied having done anything to her, Decker wrote in the affidavit.\n\nAnthony Virbitsky told police he checked on Novak but found no blood, although she was breathing heavily. He asked her if she wanted to go to a hospital, the affidavit said, but she refused. When he went to check on her less than an hour later, she was dead, Virbitsky told police, and then his grandson confessed that he had hit her.\n\nAn autopsy performed Monday discovered \"blunt force trauma to Novak's neck\" and her death was ruled a homicide, the district attorney's statement said.\n\nSome residents in Damascus Township took issue with locking up the boy in the county jail.\n\n\"I know they see a lot of things but I don't think that they understand what they're doing,\" Kristy Tirney told WBRE. \"I don't know.\""}

She said they'd spent much of the last two days in their hotel room. \"Thank God for Facebook,\" she added. \"That kept them entertained.\"\n\nAll city parks and the High Line are closed indefinitely. In Central Park at least 250 mature trees were felled by the storm, with benches and playgrounds damaged as well. \"It's all about keeping the public safe,\" said Doug Blonsky, president and CEO of the Central Park Conservancy.\n\nMost Broadway matinee and evening performances were expected to play as scheduled today. Cancellations included \"Evita,\" ''The Lion King,\" ''Mary Poppins\" and \"Scandalous.\"\n\nThomas Karlegott waited with his wife and another couple from Angelholm, Sweden, all on their first visit to New York, for the opening of the TKTS booth in Times Square today. He said they'd be happy with tickets to any show at all after wandering around a largely shuttered Manhattan for the last few days without doing much.\n\n\"We ate good food,\" he added with a smile, but admitted that they'd missed shopping and going to museums.\n\nSubways remained closed, making it difficult to get around. The Staten Island Ferry, a humble commuter boat that's popular with tourists because it offers a free, beautiful view of New York Harbor, was shut due to flooding in the ferry terminal. Yellow cabs were on the streets but hard to come by.\n\nLocal buses were running, but double-decker tour buses — normally a ubiquitous sight around the city — remained out of service today, though City Sights, Gray Line and other bus companies announced on their websites that they hoped to resume operations Thursday. Circle Line boat tours said via Twitter that they also hoped to resume Thursday.\n\nThe Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island were expected to remain closed at least until Saturday, according to their websites.\n\nTourism is the city's fifth largest industry, with an annual economic impact worth $52 billion, including $34.5 billion in direct spending. Nearly 51 million people visited New York City in 2011. The city's official tourism agency, NYC & Co., referred a request for comment to the mayor's office, which did not immediately respond.\n\nAmong those lining up at the Museum of Modern Art were Sophie Manisse and her two daughters from Lyon, France. \"We wanted to see the Halloween parade,\" she said, referring to the annual Greenwich Village event, which was canceled. Instead, they headed into MOMA, where Edvard Munch's \"The Scream\" went on display a week ago and seemed to symbolize the state of mind of many visitors.\n\n\"We're really upset,\" said Debbie Clinton, visiting the city from Liverpool, England, as they walked into the Empire State Building, one of the first of the city's major attractions to reopen Wednesday morning. \"We bought passes for all these attractions and we haven't used them.\" They were heading home Thursday.\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art also opened today, and the Guggenheim opened for one exhibition, \"Picasso Black and White.\"\n\nCrowds of would-be shoppers gathered outside Macy's and other stores today in anticipation of the doors opening.\n\n\"It's filled with tourists!\" reported Macy's spokeswoman Elina Kazan a few minutes after the store opened. She said they had limited staffing but saluted the workers who made it to 34th Street from the city's far-flung neighborhoods \"by any means possible. They walked, carpooled, bused or cabbed from the boroughs. Many waited for hours but made it in.\"\n\nSome visitors had a philosophical attitude. Martine Juillard of Paris, waiting with her two teenage daughters for an Abercrombie & Fitch store to open on Fifth Avenue Wednesday, said there had been some frightening moments during the worst of the storm.\n\n\"We are pleased because we are alive,\" she said with a bold smile. \"For the shops and the museums, we'll come back another time.\"\n\n— The Associated Press"}
{"text": "Colorado has 58 mountain peaks exceeding 14,000 feet (known as \"fourteeners\" or \"14ers\" locally) — the most of any state. Outdoor enthusiasts of all skill levels will find peaks ranging from easy to very difficult, with hiking trails for exploring the state's scenery, wildlife and rugged beauty.\n\nHiking a Colorado 14er\n\nSome of the Colorado's best-known fourteeners include the tallest, Mount Elbert; Pikes Peak, which inspired the poem \"America the Beautiful\"; and Longs Peak, which resides inside Rocky Mountain National Park. See a full list of 14ers and their elevations and an awesome infographic that describes what makes them so special to Coloradans. The reward for reaching the summit of one of these 14ers? Some of the most breathtaking views you'll find anywhere on the planet, as well as stargazing opportunities. But it's important to know a few things before you head out to these massive Colorado fourteeners. There is a debate about exactly how many 14ers there are in Colorado. The Colorado Geological Survey says there are 58 peaks that exceed 14,000 feet in elevation. Others use this logic: To qualify, a peak must rise at least 300 feet above the saddle that connects it to the nearest 14er peak (if another exists nearby). You can make up your own mind!\n\nIf you're looking for a bit more solitude, we recommend detouring from the very popular 14ers to a few of 580-plus 13ers in Colorado, which pack just as much adventure punch in slightly less elevation. (Read about a couple who has climbed all Colorado 13ers on the Colorado Outdoor Adventure Blog.)\n\nBe Aware of the Effects of Altitude\n\nWhile climbing up a fourteener can lead you to breathtaking views, the thinner air can lead to altitude sickness. Altitude sickness is brought on by a lack of oxygen to your body and a failure to acclimate to air that has less oxygen. It can be caused by going too high, too fast.\n\nThe problem is, everyone's body has a different rate of acclimating, so it's important to be aware of any changes you feel. The most widely felt symptom is a headache, but other symptoms include shortness of breath, tightness in the chest, marked fatigue and weakness. If you experience any of these, just follow the simple guidelines below and let others know you're not feeling 100 percent. Symptoms often improve once your body adapts to the higher elevation, but you need to be patient — and most importantly, keep hydrated and take it easy.\n\n• Drink plenty of water; replenishing fluids helps to stabilize your body.\n\n• Take it easy; don't over-exert yourself.\n\n• Experts recommend eating a high carbohydrate diet while at altitude.\n\n• Keep alcohol intake and smoking to a minimum.\n\n• Remember that altitude sickness can affect anybody, even top-flight athletes.\n\n• Most importantly: if you're not feeling well, let someone know.\n\nLeave No Trace\n\nColorado has the great fortune of having these 58 majestic fourteeners right in our backyard. But every year, an increasing number of hikers and climbers attempt to ascend one of these peaks, impacting the alpine environment. It is up to those who love these mountains to minimize damage to their fragile ecosystems. The Leave No Trace (LNT) program is dedicated to building awareness, appreciation, and most of all, respect for our public recreation places. It is not based on rules and regulations as much as attitude and awareness.\n\nPlease be sure to follow the Leave No Trace principles so that future generations can continue to enjoy Colorado's breathtaking mountains:\n\n• Rest on rocks, not on vegetation.\n\n• Leave what you find, including flowers and berries.\n\n• Pack out all food; don't throw it on the ground.\n\n• Conduct bathroom stops at least 200 feet from bodies of water.\n\n• Pack out toilet paper in plastic bags.\n\n• Stay on designated trails and don't cut across switchbacks.\n\n• Walk through puddles on the trail, not around them, to avoid creating wider or multiple trails.\n\n• Spread out when walking in areas where there is no trail.\n\n• Avoid loose rock debris covering a slope; use the most stable route.\n\nWant More?\n\nFor more information on the fourteeners in Colorado, including a complete list, trip reports and more, visit 14ers.com and the Colorado Fourteeners Initiative.

{"text": "Yes, a lot of the issues with the keyboard remain. It's narrow, tightly spaced and otherwise not the best keyboard BlackBerry has ever made. (To me, that honor goes to the Bold 9900.) Also, a slider design on a large 5.4-inch phone creates a unique problem: It's so tall in its extended mode that I occasionally had to hold it close to me to avoid banging against nearby objects. For that matter, the software autocorrect would sometimes fail to kick in while I was using the physical keyboard, leaving me to correct typos like it was 2006 all over again.\n\nBut when everything works, it works. It's not so much the speed -- it's not that much faster than using a touchscreen keyboard -- as the feel and how it frees up screen space. There's something satisfying about flicking out the keyboard to wake the phone and dash off a message. And hiding the software keyboard is just perfect for chat apps like Hangouts, where all that newly freed-up real estate lets me track more of the conversation without scrolling. Although the on-screen keyboard is well-done, I found myself leaning toward the old-school buttons when I had the chance.\n\nPart of the appeal comes when I do have to scroll, mind you. The keyboard's gesture support is inconsistent, even within apps (Flickr reverses scrolling directions in different sections, for instance), but on the whole it's very useful. I can read an article without obscuring the page, or follow the strands of a long Twitter conversation without lifting my hands off the keys. While I didn't use the other features much (such as selecting text or erasing whole words), they were nice to have now and then. These gestures were also present on the Passport, of course, but it's still great to have them here too, especially when there's a rich app ecosystem that can take advantage of those keyboard swipes.\n\nHow does the rest of the Priv stack up, you ask? Pretty well, actually. The quad HD display and 18-megapixel camera remain good but not great, and the battery life with heavy use (e.g., social networking and music streaming) is merely average despite the big 3,410mAh battery. However, the phone could almost always keep up with what I wanted to do. The Snapdragon 808 chip and 3GB of RAM aren't as powerful as you'll get in some phones in this class, but they're still up to the job of driving a flagship device. About the only let-down was the low-light photography, which was reasonably bright but also noisy and colorless (though it did get better, as you'll see below). You could never touch the Priv's keyboard and still get a pretty solid smartphone.\n\nAnd yes, moving to Android has done wonders for the BlackBerry experience. As good as a few elements of BlackBerry 10 were -- multitasking in particular -- it's refreshing to have an ample supply of native apps, instead of repackaged titles or, more often, nothing at all. Instagram? Flickr? Swarm? Yes to all of them. BlackBerry's custom touches are generally welcome, too, like pop-up widgets and stars to indicate apps with notifications. Some of the software is superfluous outside of certain business users; I didn't really need DTEK's security audits, for instance. All the same, I'd say BlackBerry struck a fine balance between maintaining Android's strong points and catering to faithful users.\n\nI'd add that BlackBerry has been good about supporting the Priv in the time I've used it. A major December update improved performance across the board, including the camera's low-light quality. On top of that, there have been numerous app updates to tweak the functionality and fix bugs. It's still not flawless: One recent crash forced me to reboot the phone. However, this is the kind of tremendous post-launch support that I wish other phone manufacturers would offer. That extra level of care stems partly from make-or-break necessity (BlackBerry may quit hardware entirely if sales remain poor), but it's greatly appreciated.\n\nMy main concern is that the Priv isn't quite as transformative an experience as BlackBerry arguably needs it to be. I did get hooked on typing on that hardware keyboard, but I felt back at home the moment I went back to typing on glass with other phones. The physical keys weren't so addictive that I found myself missing them dearly, and that's a problem when rivals like the Galaxy Note 5 and Nexus 6P are faster, take better photos and otherwise sport more bells and whistles. Even so, I'm going to miss the Priv -- and that's something I haven't said about a BlackBerry in a long time."}
{"text": "A California father whose son was murdered execution-style in 2008 by an illegal immigrant gangster has launched a campaign to persuade Gov. Jerry Brown to veto a bill that would have police release illegal immigrants into the streets even when the feds want them detained.\n\nThe controversial bill, which passed the legislature in August, would compel local law enforcement in most cases to ignore requests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold illegal immigrants if they could otherwise be released.\n\nAdvocates say it's a way for police to build \"trust\" with local communities -- the name of the bill is the TRUST Act. But opponents warn the policy could have dangerous consequences.\n\nThe bill \"will have real and potentially devastating consequences for people across our state,\" Jamiel Shaw Sr., whose 17-year-old son was killed, said in a statement.\n\nShaw separately put out a web video appealing to Brown to reject the bill.\n\nMore On This... Governor Brown, please veto immigration bill AB 1081\n\n\"Would you want that to happen to your son? ... How many have to die by people being let out into the streets from the county jail that should be deported,\" he said in the video. \"No one should have to go through losing a child.\"\n\nClick for the original story on Shaw's case.\n\nShaw's son Jamiel Shaw Jr., a high school football player, was killed in 2008 by a member of the 18th Street Gang hours after he had been released from a local jail. Pedro Espinoza was found guilty of the murder, in which he shot Shaw twice after mistaking him for a rival gang member. A jury recommended the death penalty for Espinoza earlier this year.\n\nBob Dane, a spokesman at the Federation for American Immigration Reform, said California would open the door to a rampant public safety threat -- as well as additional financial burden on the state -- if the governor lets the bill become law. He noted Brown could opt to take no action on the bill, allowing it to become law by default.\n\n\"It's the perfect storm for complete lawlessness,\" he told FoxNews.com, saying the state would be rolling out \"the welcome mat\" for illegal immigrants and become even more of a magnet.\n\n\"This is not the work of responsible custodians of the public trust,\" he said.\n\nThe bill would compel law enforcement in California to release illegal immigrants once they become eligible -- even if ICE wants them held -- unless the individual has been convicted of a \"serious or violent felony.\"\n\nSupporters cited the financial burden on local communities that hold these detainees for ICE and the potential erosion of trust with police.\n\nIn a Sept. 13 letter to Brown signed by House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic members of the California congressional delegation, supporters urged the governor to sign the bill. They cited accounts that a federal program called Secure Communities \"currently erodes trust between local communities and law enforcement.\"\n\n\"They report that the initiative already has reduced the willingness of immigrant and non-immigrant crime victims and witnesses to cooperate with law enforcement and has consequently diminished public safety,\" they wrote. The suggestion is that illegal immigrants would be reluctant to report crimes out of concern ICE would come after them.\n\nSecure Communities is a program that allows federal immigration agents to work with local officials to determine who in local jails might be deportable.\n\nBut Shaw argues that police in California are not interested in checking the immigration status of people who report or witness crimes.\n\nFurther, he argues that in California in particular, illegal immigrants are not fearful of law enforcement.\n\nFederal immigration officials have defended the Secure Communities program, which they say has helped the agency remove nearly 150,000 convicted criminals to date -- including murderers and rapists.\n\nICE Director John Morton wrote in an Aug. 23 letter to FAIR that communities that ignore ICE requests to hold detainees \"are undermining public safety in their communities by exposing their local communities to risks from suspected and convicted sex offenders, weapons violators, drunk drivers and other violent criminals.\"\n\n\"These are not hypothetical risks,\" he wrote. The letter was in reference to a separate initiative in Illinois.\n\nICE spokeswoman Gillian Christensen told FoxNews.com on Wednesday that the agency implements \"clear priorities\" to focus on convicted criminals. She stressed the importance of local cooperation, without commenting specifically on the California proposal.\n\n\"The federal government alone sets these priorities and places detainers on individuals arrested on criminal charges to ensure that dangerous criminal aliens and other priority individuals are not released from prisons/jails and into our communities,\" she said. \"The Administration remains committed to immigration reform and to enforcing current law in a smart and effective manner across the country.\""}

The technique could help technologies such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and robotics. Credit: Purdue University\n\nA new technique that uses the artificial intelligence methods of machine learning and deep learning is able to create 3-D shapes from 2-D images, such as photographs, and is even able to create new, never-before-seen shapes.\n\nKarthik Ramani, Purdue's Donald W. Feddersen Professor of Mechanical Engineering, says that the \"magical\" capability of AI deep learning is that it is able to learn abstractly.\n\n\"If you show it hundreds of thousands of shapes of something such as a car, if you then show it a 2-D image of a car, it can reconstruct that model in 3-D,\" he says. \"It can even take two 2-D images and create a 3-D shape between the two, which we call 'hallucination.'\"\n\nWhen fully developed, this method, called SurfNet, could have significant applications in the fields of 3-D searches on the Internet, as well as helping robotics and autonomous vehicles better understand their surroundings.\n\nPerhaps most exciting, however, is that the technique could be used to create 3-D content for virtual reality and augmented reality by simply using standard 2-D photos.\n\n\"You can imagine a movie camera that is taking pictures in 2-D, but in the virtual reality world everything is appearing magically in 3-D,\" Ramani says. \"Inch-by-inch we are going there, and in the next five years something like this is going to happen.\n\nCredit: Purdue University\n\n\"Pretty soon we will be at a stage where humans will not be able to differentiate between reality and virtual reality.\"\n\nWhen fully developed, this method, called SurfNet, could have significant applications in the fields of 3-D searches on the Internet, as well as helping robotics and autonomous vehicles better understand their surroundings.\n\nPerhaps most exciting, however, is that the technique could be used to create 3-D content for virtual reality and augmented reality by simply using standard 2-D photos.\n\n\"You can imagine a movie camera that is taking pictures in 2-D, but in the virtual reality world everything is appearing magically in 3-D,\" Ramani says. \"Inch-by-inch we are going there, and in the next five years something like this is going to happen.\n\n\"Pretty soon we will be at a stage where humans will not be able to differentiate between reality and virtual reality.\"\n\nThe computer system then learns both the 3-D image and the 2-D image in pairs, and then is able to predict other, similar 3-D shapes from just a 2-D image.\n\n\"This is very similar to how a camera or scanner uses just three colors, red, green and blue—known as RGB—to create a color image, except we use the XYZ coordinates,\" he says.\n\nAI computers may soon be able to create new 3-D shapes just by looking at two 2-D images, such as photos, says Purdue University professor Karthik Ramani, and also come up with shapes for new images such as by \"hallucination.\" Credit: Purdue University\n\nRamani says this technique also allows for greater accuracy and precision than current 3-D deep learning methods that operate more using volumetric pixels (or voxels).\n\n\"We use the surfaces instead since it fully defines the shape. It's kind of an interesting offshoot of this method. Because we are working in the 2-D domain to reconstruct the 3-D structure, instead of doing 1,000 data points like you would otherwise with other emerging methods, we can do 10,000 points. We are more efficient and compact.\"\n\nOne significant outcome of the research would be for robotics, object recognition and even self-driving cars in the future; they would only need to be fitted with standard 2-D cameras, yet still have the ability to understand the 3-D environment around them.\n\nRamani says that for this research to be developed, more basic research in AI will be needed.\n\n\"There's not a box of machine learning algorithms where we can take those and apply them and things work magically,\" he says. \"To move from the flatland to the 3-D world we will need much more basic research. We are pushing, but the mathematics and computational techniques of deep learning are still being invented and largely an unknown area in 3-D.\""}
{"text": "Real Salt Lake and Sporting Kansas City will add another chapter to their heated rivalry on Saturday, when the Claret-and-Cobalt head to Children's Mercy Park for the clubs' first regular-season meeting of the year (8:30 pm ET | MLS LIVE.)\n\nSporting's players -- some of whom have been central to the feud over the years -- are somewhat divided over whether the rivalry is as hot as it once was. After all, it's been almost two years since any kind of flare-up in the national media.\n\nThat last happened in 2015, with Sporting midfielder Benny Feilhaber lighting some fires when he called RSL the team he \"[hates] the most.\" (Feilhaber, by the way, is among those who still sees the rivalry as undiminished.) His targeted disdain for Real -- and especially for midfielder Kyle Beckerman -- was one of the hotter flashpoints in the long-running rivalry, one that predates SKC's win against RSL in MLS Cup 2013 and traces its origins all the way back to a preseason friendly in 2011.\n\n2011 Preseason Punches\n\nThe RSL-SKC feud really got going in March 2011, when a preseason friendly between the two sides in Arizona erupted into a full-fledged brawl. Physical from the opening whistle, the match turned on its head late in the second half, with both benches clearing after Roger Espinoza made a hard tackle on RSL's Javier Morales.\n\nThen-RSL head coach Jason Kreis pulled his team off the field following the fisticuffs, abandoning the match with about 10 minutes still to play. The clubs did some battle in the press following the game, with RSL alleging that SKC's Omar Bravo kicked Morales in the head during the melee, a charge that SKC vehemently denied.\n\nWingert sends a message, Opara gets last laugh\n\nAfter two years of relative peace, the rivalry ratcheted back up with an intense encounter at Rio Tinto Stadium in July 2013. Chris Wingert set the tone early, leveling SKC forward Kei Kamara in a nasty collision just seconds after kick off.\n\nWingert, who was controversially given only a yellow for the challenge, would get ejected later in the match, earning a second yellow for a 66th minute foul. SKC bagged the equalizer on the ensuing free kick, with Ike Opara eventually scoring in the seventh minute of stoppage time – five minutes were initially posted – to give Sporting a 2-1 win.\n\nIt was no idle goal. SKC ended the regular season with 58 points to RSL's 56 – giving them home field advantage over the Claret-and-Cobalt in that December's MLS Cup.\n\nMLS Cup 2013\n\nWe all remember Sporting's dramatic shootout win, RSL's three shots off the post and the bitter, bitter cold.\n\nWith all the drama on the field, you'd be forgiven for not recalling some of the barbs traded before and after MLS Cup 2013. Then-RSL GM Garth Lagerwey famously called his team \"diametrically opposed\" from Sporting, saying Salt Lake's \"passing, possession, beautiful game\" stood in stark contrast to Kansas City's \"physical, rock 'em, sock 'em style.\"\n\nSporting used his comments as a bit of extra motivation for MLS Cup, with Jacob Peterson and Eric Kronberg notably referencing the remarks in celebratory tweets after the match.\n\nThe fans got in on the action too, with RSL supporters stung after many used a leaked code initially intended for SKC season ticket holders to purchase tickets – which were later voided – to the final at Sporting Park.\n\nFeilhaber fires things up\n\nFeilhaber's 2015 comments came at an opportune time: Sporting's move back to the Western Conference made the feud more regular, after five years of only facing off once in league play.\n\nThere has been only one knockout match between the two sides since 2013, with Sporting prevailing 3-1 in the 2015 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup semifinals on their way to that year's title -- but RSL have had the better of league action in recent years, going unbeaten in MLS play against Sporting since that hard-fought MLS Cup final.\n\nSporting will be looking to get back on top of the scoreline on Saturday night -- and despite two coaching changes for Real and a host of personnel changes on both sides since the height of the feud, chances are that, even with cool weather and rain predicted for the match, it's going to be a heated affair once more."}
{"text": "SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email\n\nThe New York City Council approved adding electronic cigarettes to a ban on smoking in offices, restaurants, bars and parks, a move that may be followed by other U.S. cities.\n\nThe measure, backed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Council Speaker Christine Quinn and Health Commissioner Thomas Farley, passed 43 to 8 yesterday.\n\nE-cigarettes, battery-operated tubes that simulate the effect of smoking by producing nicotine vapor, may be a gateway to smoking regular cigarettes and make quitting harder, Quinn said. The law would take effect in four months, said Jamie McShane, a spokesman for the speaker.\n\nProponents say e-cigarettes don't produce the toxic and carcinogenic byproducts found in second-hand smoke. Users, who call the practice \"vaping,\" turn to e-cigarettes to wean themselves off regular ones and shouldn't be stigmatized, according to a pro-industry website funded by NJOY Inc. a Scottsdale, Arizona-based e-cigarette maker.\n\n\"The council has worked for well over a decade to curb smoking in New York City and I really believe it's one of our greatest accomplishments,\" Quinn said before the vote. \"E-cigarettes threaten, in my opinion, to undermine enforcement of the Smoke-Free Air Act.\"\n\nSince Bloomberg took office in 2002, the city has raised tobacco taxes and banned smoking in public places, a move copied by municipalities across the U.S. In a council hearing this month, Farley said failing to ban e-cigarettes would jeopardize progress.\n\nLife Expectancy\n\nBloomberg, who has pushed public-health programs, both as mayor and as a private philanthropist, says the smoking rate of adult New Yorkers has fallen by more than a quarter during his 12-year term, while teen smoking has been cut in half. The change has contributed to city residents' life expectancy rising to a record of almost 81 years for babies born in 2010.\n\nThe mayor has also required restaurant chains to post the calorie content of menu items and sought to limit sales of large-sized sugary drinks. Critics say Bloomberg has tried to impose a \"nanny-state,\" with government policies that interfere with personal choice.\n\nTobacco industry analysts are watching e-cigarette regulation in New York and potential bans in Chicago and Los Angeles because of the possibility that other cities will follow suit, said Ken Shea, a senior analyst with Bloomberg Industries in Skillman, New Jersey. Such bans may curb e-cigarette sales, estimated next year at $3 billion annually, he said.\n\nFollowing Suit\n\n\"Look at all the other policies that Mayor Bloomberg has put in that have been copied by others,\" said Shea. \"It's reasonable to think it could happen with e-cigs as well.\"\n\nThe mayor is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.\n\nMost major tobacco companies, including Altria Group Inc. and Reynolds American Inc., are pursuing the e-cigarette market, Shea said.\n\nIn October, Murray Kessler, chief executive of Lorillard Inc., which acquired Blu Ecigs for $135 million last year, said vaping is exacerbating the decline of traditional cigarettes, reducing volume by about 1 percent. U.S. sales of cigarettes totaled $89 billion in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nA Lorillard executive said before the vote that the company\n\nwas disappointed with the decision.\n\n\"Making less harmful products widely available to smokers should be a top priority,\" said Robert Bannon, the company's director of investor relations, in an e-mailed statement. \"However, the NYC e-cigarette ban will only discourage smokers of combustible cigarettes who want to switch to an alternative product.\"\n\nAge Law\n\nThe council's vote comes two months after it raised the legal age to buy tobacco products and electronic cigarettes to 21 years old from 18. New York joins states such as New Jersey and Utah that ban the use of e-cigarettes where smoking is prohibited.\n\nThe percentage of high-school students who reported using an e-cigarette rose to 10 percent in 2012 from 4.7 percent a year earlier, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Youth Tobacco Survey released in September. The study also found that about three-quarters of students who used e-cigarettes within the past 30 days also smoked conventional ones in the same period.\n\nLast year, 1.8 million middle- and high-school students had tried e-cigarettes, a trend that CDC Director Tom Frieden, a former New York City health commissioner, called \"deeply troubling.\"\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration is considering regulating the products."}
{"text": "In one of the earlier posts i did about Jewelcrafting  i broke it down to the basics and came out with the fact that if you wanted to get into the jewelcrafting market you would need to invest 207 days of dailies in order to get all the patterns from the vendor. Well in MoP we have a different approach to how the patterns are obtained, namely you are given the chance to research a color of a gem by spending 3 uncut gems, and if you have learned all the cuts that you can have from that particular color then you can get a different color gem.\n   If you take this into account and compare it with the previous 207 days you needed to do dailies, with this new way of obtaining cuts you are down to 68 days of dailies, but if you take into account that you can obtain gem cuts by spending 3 Spirits of Harmony you can knock off a few days from that count as well.\n   Now that we looked at the time table needed to level a jewelcrafter, lets take a look at the gems and how they are going to work.\n    In Cataclysm we had The Ore Shuffle  where we would prospect ore, cut and sell the rare gems and DE the rings and amulets we got from the shuffle to get Enchanting materials. Well in MoP this formula is a tad bit different, namely there are no rings and amulets right off the bat, you have to go and get them from a jewelcrafting trainer in The Jade Forest, but even when you get them there will be a catch. Namely this catch is the fact that in order to craft those you will need to spend 3 different kinds of gems for the green item, or if you want to craft the rare version you will need to spend 6 normal gems and 6 Serpent Eyes. \n   So as we can see the difference is huge, in Cataclysm all we needed was 1 gem and a setting, and now we need 3 different color gems, or 6 gems and 6 serpent eyes. It remains to be seen if this is still going to be a viable way to deal with the gems when the prices normalize.\n   Now as you can see on the image above, there is another way to go about with your normal gems, and this way is to cut them. You see when you cut them you have about 15% chance that they will be a rare quality \"perfect\" gem. This means one thing though, you can choose which gem you want to make even if you don't have the pattern learned by now. For instance, if you want a 240 Stamina gem, but you don't have the cut learned just yet, then take a stack of Lapis Lazuli and get down to cutting, and with a bit of luck you will get a perfect one that has the same stats as the rare one.\n   Ok now we know the time table, as well as how to cut any gem we need, what is left now is what to expect from the JC market.\n   At the moment the Jewelcrafting market is very slow, and the reason for this is simple, people are still leveling or they have leveled up but aren't still geared enough to be able to start doing heroics, raids and LFR. Once this has been surpassed we will see a sharp increase in the gems market, and with that a sharp rise in the prices of gems.\n   What you want to do to prepare for that is quite simple, from time to time browse the market for the cut gems, as well as the perfect cut version of the gem and if you see any cheap ones buy them out and store them. The reason for this is simple, the amount of uncut gems that is in circulation is alot smaller then the amount of gems that is going to be required once the people start getting gear that requires gems.\n   Anyways here are the things that you might want to know if you want to get into this market:\nDo your daily research cuts Check the AH for low priced gems and buy them out  Prices of uncut gems are going to be higher then prices of the cut ones for a while due to people buying them so they can use their daily cool down, so if you have some for sale, sell them uncut. You want to be playing your JC character because that is the only way to obtain the Meta gem patterns and the Spirit of Harmony that you can use the expedite the research of new cuts.    So by knowing this you should be well armed to start on your way to sail the waters of the JC market.\n   So, like always, keep an eye out for good opportunities out there."}
{"text": "Kalamazoo bartender Steven Crawley wasn't much of a guy for Facebook, a former coworker at Waldo's Campus Tavern said.\n\nIt was his real-time, face-to-face conversations with the people he met that earned Crawley friends from across the country, said Eric \"Ferg\" Ferguson, now general manager at Hooters on South Westnedge Avenue.\n\nSteven D. Crawley, 45, formerly of Dowagiac, died Wednesday, Feb. 20. He had been undergoing regular kidney dialysis for more than a year, Ferguson said.\n\nCrawley and Ferguson were roommates in their days as students at Western Michigan University , and worked together as doormen -- bouncers-- at Waldo's in the early 1990s, Ferguson said, before working their way up to bartender status. \"He loved the kids, loved the excitement\" of working in a campus establishment, Ferguson said. \"He was always upbeat.\"\n\nCrawley was a talker, Ferguson said, and could easily regale the bar with stories, even those he may have told before, of growing up in Dowagiac and the mischief he and his brother got into. But he was also a great listener, allowing patrons to guide the course of the conversation, his co-worker said.\n\nAlways upbeat and cheerful, Crawley had the knack of being honest with people, Ferguson said. \"If stuff was wrong, he'd tell you. If someone was bitching and moaning about something\" that was basically their own fault, \"he'd tell them, 'You know, you caused that.' \"\n\n\nCrawley was an avid Los Angeles Lakers fan, and loved the University of Michigan, but his conversations went far beyond sports.\n\n\"He was a very smart individual, and could talk about anything ...,\" said Ferguson, \"whatever the topic of the day was.\"\n\nCrawley also had that special trait of a good bartender. \"He knew what everyone wanted to drink at all times, and that's a huge skill. You want your drink, don't want to wait,\" Ferguson said.\n\n\nHe said his friend had been on disability leave for quite some time, and was undergoing kidney dialysis a few times a week for more than a year-and- half before his death.\n\nHe kept up his spirits throughout, Ferguson said. \"He was either up, or getting up,\" he said.\n\nWhen news of his death reached the patrons at Waldo's on Wednesday night, \"I bought a round and we offered up a toast\" to Crawley, said Bruce Hayes, the general manager at Waldo's.\n\nHe, too, was a friend and former roommate of Crawley. He said people have been dropping in this week to reminisce and inquire about arrangements, even though it has been three years since Crawley last worked there.\n\nHayes said Crawley was well liked by employees and customers alike, and could as easily speak to young college students as he could their professors.\n\n\"He remembered details about people,\" Hayes said.\n\nHayes said Crawley concocted a popular drink of flavored vodka, lime juice and little water that he named after himself, and \"in the past few days, people have been ordering them.\"\n\nFerguson said: \"There are a lot of folks that miss him and love him throughout the country, and he has friends all over. A lot of people ... wish they could have come by and said goodbye.\"\n\nCrawley is survived by his parents Mary L. and James L. Crawley, Jr.; brother, James L. Crawley III; grandparents, Mary Edwina Crawley, Beatrice Jackson and James L. Crawley, all of Dowagiac; aunts, Patricia A. (Robert) Gonder of Cornelius, N.C., Theresa L.

{"text": "Thousands of pieces of correspondence, many still unopened, were stored away by Dutch postmaster and are now being examined by academics\n\nAn appeal for help from a desperate woman has been opened and read more than 300 years after the man it was sent to refused to accept delivery – not surprisingly, since the wealthy merchant in The Hague must have suspected it contained the unwelcome news that he was about to become a father.\n\n\nThe letter is part of an extraordinary trove of thousands of pieces of correspondence, never delivered, many still unopened and sealed closed, found packed into a leather trunk and stored away for centuries in the Netherlands.\n\nThe collection includes letters from aristocrats, spies, merchants, publishers, actors, musicians, barely literate peasants and highly educated people with beautiful handwriting, and are written in French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch and Latin.\n\nOne of the letters that has been transcribed and translated is from a woman writing to a Jewish merchant in The Hague on behalf of \"a mutual friend\". The friend was a singer with the Hague opera who had left for Paris, where she discovered the disastrous truth. She needed money from the merchant to return.\n\n\"You can divine without difficulty the true cause of her despair. I cannot put it into so many words; what I ought to say to you is so excessive. Content yourself with thinking on it, and returning her to life by procuring her return,\" it says.\n\nThe letter is marked \"niet hebben\", indicating that the man refused to accept it. The fate of the poor singer is unknown. Daniel Starza Smith, of Oxford University, said the man was undoubtedly the father of the child – the true cause of the singer's departure.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The trunk in which the letters were kept Photograph: Hague Museum for Communication\n\nThe linen-lined leather trunk, covered in official seals, was presented to a postal museum in The Hague in 1926, but the 2,600 letters it held, 600 of them unopened, are only now being studied by an international team of academics, including scholars from Leiden, Oxford, MIT and Yale.\n\nSpecial scanning techniques will be used to examine the contents without opening the sealed letters or damaging the ingenious variety of ways in which the pages were folded to so that the letter became its own envelope. The letters were sent between 1680 and 1706, a time of constant war and political upheaval in Europe, and were kept by a married couple, Simon de Brienne and Maria Germain, the postmaster and mistress in The Hague.\n\nThey were a canny business couple who spent a period in England as court officials to the newly crowned William III before selling their positions for £1,550 and a barrel of Burgundy and returning home.\n\nAt the time the delivery of letters was paid for by the recipient, and many may have been undeliverable because the recipient had changed address – one had been forwarded to a series of different addresses, in vain – or even died. Smith believes that they were kept in the hope that one day they would be collected and paid for.\n\n'Something about these letters frozen in transit makes you feel like you've caught a moment in history off guard,\" he said. \"Many of the writers and intended recipients of these letters were people who travelled throughout Europe, such as wandering musicians and religious exiles. The trunk preserves letters from many social classes, and women as well as men.\n\n\"Most documents that survive from this period record the activities of elites – aristocrats and their bureaucrats, or rich merchants – so these letters will tell us new things about an important section of society in 17th-century Europe. These are the kinds of people whose records frequently don't survive, so this is a fantastic opportunity to hear new historical voices.\"\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A paper dove included with one of the letters. Photograph: Hague Museum for Communication\n\nMany of the letters, he said, even preserved the quality of spoken language of the day, frequently written down without punctuation.\n\nMany of the letters refer to the political turmoil of the time, with reports of highway robbery, religious discrimination and other perils. One man wrote from Nancy, in France, in 1702 warning his musician brother not to attempt to travel via Paris as a fellow musician had been conscripted into the army there. He added the warning: \"If you come here, do not bring your instrument or anything else.\"\n\nOften the anguish was more personal than political. One woman wrote enclosing a cut-out paper dove holding a flaming heart, bitterly recalling \"the fidelity which you promised me and which I have given with all my soul\". Whoever the faithless lover was, he never got the letter."}

{"text": "Today, whisk(e)y writer Jim Murray, the most well-known name in the judging of brown spirits, announced the winning whiskies among those judged for his annual release of the Whiskey Bible (available November 24), his guide to every whiskey (over 1,000 of them) that he graded over the course of 2015. The guide is always controversial: last year Murray gave the top award to Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2013, marking the first time that a Japanese whisky took the title; he didn't include a single bottle from Scotland on the shortlist. This year, however, marks the high-water mark for Murray's controversy. The 2016 World Whisky of the Year is an offering from Crown Royal, a company that was second in US whiskey sales only to Jack Daniels in 2014. The distillery's new release, Northern Harvest Rye, scored 97.5 points on Murray's 100-point scale to take home the title. The runner-up is another rye; third place goes to an Irish whiskey, a first for the island nation; and again, no Scottish bottles made the top five.\n\n\"This year, doubtless there will be many more eyebrows raised because rarely is Canada mentioned when it come to the world's top whiskies. But, again, I have no doubt people finding the bottling I tasted will be blown away with this whisky's uncompromising and unique beauty,\" writes Murray. \"It certainly puts the rye into Canadian rye.\"\n\nThis last line hits hardest when you taste the Northern Harvest Rye yourself. It's no doubt a fantastic rye, but it's also a conservative one. It doesn't try to be anything but a pure expression of the grain, a benchmark for what rye should be, and a re-establishment of Canada as a contender in the spirit they are most known for.\n\nMurray is known for his no-bullshit approach to whiskey. He won't be bought (he now retains full copyright on any articles he publishes), and he won't follow trends, making for very controversial, and extremely influential, rankings. This year's top two whiskeys are both ryes, an unusual choice given that this type of whiskey trails far behind single malt, Irish whiskey and bourbon sales in America, but one that has been gaining intense popularity. Since 2009, rye sales have increased 536 percent, reaching over half a million cases in 2014, according to the industry group Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, as reported by Fortune. The top two winners are not limited releases, sport no age statements and are relatively widely available — far from the exclusivity of typical spirits-competition winners and of Murray's picks in years' past. Crown Royal Northern Harvest Rye can be purchased here and shipped to most states, and the runner-up Pikesville Straight Rye is a dressed-up re-imagining of Pikesville Rye, once a bottom-shelf rye from the Potomac region. Heaven Hill purchased the brand and put out a premium version of whiskey this summer, abandoning the old $11 bottles.\n\nThose who have followed the trajectory of Murray's Whiskey Bible, now in its 13th year, know that Murray has elevated discussion around whisk(e)y from America, Canada and Japan when offerings from those nations were considered inferior to the legacy brands of Scotland. He's pushed aside institutions and judged based on the merit of the dram alone, contributing to craft distillers' ability to be taken seriously in an industry once dominated by 20-year-old stocks of liquid from Scottish giants. But Canadian whisky is a different beast entirely, considered the \"Wild West\" of distilling. The bottles can contain both caramel color and additive flavoring, and there's no regulations that address the quality of the barrels, which can be new or used, charred or un-charred. World Whisky of the Year is an award he once gave to a 21-year-old bottle from Old Pulteney, a very traditional and regarded expression of single malt. Now the award has gone to something from a brand known for purple felt drawstring bags, owned by the liquor giant Diageo.\n\nAnd maybe that's the point. Fuck pretension. Fuck branding, backstories and who you know. If it's good enough, it'll win. And when it wins with Jim Murray, the whole world hears about it. Below are the top five winners from this year's Whisky Bible. Murray has increased his World Whiskies of the Year shortlist to a list of five and added the category of of Single Cask of the Year (Glenfarclas The Family Casks 1957 #2110). All of the whisk(e)y he ranked over 96 points out of 100 can be found here."}
{"text": "BALLABGARH: Returning home to a village near Ballabgarh in Haryana, after shopping for Eid at Jama Masjid in Delhi, a family ran into a nightmare on a local train on Thursday evening. For three and a half hours, they were abused, humiliated and assaulted by a mob of 15-20 people that passed communal remarks and accused them of carrying beef in a bag.Finally, a 19-year-old was stabbed to death and another received stab injuries. The GRP at Ballabgarh railway station failed to intervene and stop the assault.The GRP claimed on Friday to have arrested a man and detained a suspect allegedly involved in the attack.Haryana DGP B S Sandhu, however, denied that the incident was the outcome of an argument over beef. \"This was a clash between two groups which resulted in the death of one person. We have already arrested one of the accused. Police teams are investigating and others too will be arrested,\" he told TOI.The youths, from Khandoa village near Ballabgarh, had boarded an EMU at Sadar Bazar around 5.30pm. Junaid, the teenager killed by the mob, and his brothers — Mohsin, Haseem and Moeen — were carrying gifts and food for their family members and had packed them in plastic bags.Haseem (20) said that they had occupied two seats and were playing ludo when the train reached Okhla station. Around 15 to 20 people boarded the Mathura-bound train and asked them to vacate the seats. When they refused, the men abused them with communal remarks.They started calling us names and said we were unpatriotic and anti-nationals and then started hitting us. They were pointing at a packet which had food and saying that we should not be allowed to sit since we were carrying beef,\" said Haseem. They denied they were carrying beef and tried to reason with the men but they became even more aggressive.Moeen (17), Junaid's cousin, said they finally got up, somehow managed to free themselves from the mob and moved to the adjacent coach but the men followed them there, hurling abuses.\"We decided to get down at Faridabad station and take another train to Ballabgarh but the men blocked our way and asked the other passengers to prevent us from leaving,\" said Mohsin (18). \"We pleaded with them to let us go but we were caught between two seats. And there was a crowd at the exit.\" Scared that they would be attacked again, Mohsin called their brother Shakir, asking him to reach the station with some help.When they tried again to get off at Ballabgarh, a heated argument ensued. Shakir had responded to their call and boarded the train. Some men in the mob now pulled out knives and attacked Junaid when he tried to force his way out. \"He was pinned by four men and stabbed repeatedly till he fell unconscious.When Shakir and Moeen tried to intervene, the men caught Shakir and stabbed him in the throat, chest and hands,\" said Mohsin.He said since the train had started moving, they pulled the chain but it didn't work.Mohsin said everything was happening in plain sight of GRP personnel at Ballabgarh railway station but they refused to help them. \"To save ourselves, we called the police and the emergency response number but there was no response,\" he said.The train reached Asavati station around 9pm where they were pushed out before the train left for Mathura. They were taken to the civil hospital at Palwal by family members who had hired an ambulance from a local hospital.Junaid was declared brought dead. Shakir was referred to AIIMS Trauma Centre where he is said to be critical. Mohseen and Moeen too were admitted to the civil hospital while Haseem was discharged after treatment.The SHO of GRP at Ballabgarh police station, Surat Pal, admitted that they couldn't rescue the four youths due to the crowd at the station. \"One of them, Mohsin, called an ambulance when his brother was stabbed. Such things happen.Whenever there is a riot or fight, such things happen and people say some communal things but we can't do anything,\" said Pal quite nonchalantly. \"The fight took place over seats. We are trying to identify the other accused.\"Union information and broadcasting minister M Venkaiah Naidu has condemned the incident. \"No one should take the law into their own hands. Even if there was a rumour, no one has the right to do this. The agencies should look into it and see who are behind this,\" he said."}
{"text": "Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan's recovery from the team's historic collapse in the Super Bowl is moving along.\n\nInstead of dealing with reality at a later date, the NFL's reigning MVP subjected himself to the torture immediately.\n\nThe Falcons held a 28-3 lead before a bundle of miscues, decisions and big plays by the Patriots led to a 34-28 loss in overtime. It was the biggest collapse in Super Bowl history.\n\n\"No, I watched it,\" Ryan said Monday at his celebrity-amateur golf tournament at TPC Sugarloaf in Duluth. \"I watched it a day after. I watched it two days after and I watched it three days after. For me, it was one of those things where you kind of want to be able to deal with it appropriately.\n\n\"Maybe, that's different for everybody. Some people bury it away. Some people (do) whatever. … For me it was 'all right, let's watch. Does it feel the same way it felt as we were going through it?'\"\n\nRyan said that he felt \"numb\" after the game.\n\nLike a lot of pundits, Ryan thought the Falcons had the game won after Julio Jones' spectacular catch to put them on the 22-yard line with 4:40 left in the fourth quarter and the Falcons up 28-20.\n\n\"When I let it go, I was just trying to put it high in a safe spot for him to make a play,\" Ryan said. \"I did that. I was fired up at that point. I thought that was going to be a play that was going to change the outcome of that game. Obviously, the next couple of plays unfolded, and we didn't end up converting (it into) points.\n\n\"At the time, I thought it was a huge play.\"\n\nBut after a sack, a holding penalty and an incomplete pass, the Falcons were out of field-goal range, and the spiral continued.\n\nRyan said he hasn't second-guessed the play-calling. Critics contend that the Falcons simply needed to call three running plays and kick a field goal after Jones' catch.\n\n\"You have to believe in what you are doing,\" Ryan said. \"That's kind of the way we were all year. That's not going to change. I love that approach.\n\n\"I love that they have confidence in me and that they have confidence in the guys that we have, and we are going to let it rip. Obviously, it didn't work out.\"\n\nFalcons coach Dan Quinn, for not overruling the play calls, and former offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan, for making the play calls, have been widely criticized for blowing a near-certain Super Bowl victory. The Falcons have never won a Super Bowl since entering the league in 1966.\n\n\"It's just the nature of the NFL,\" Ryan said. \"I think that's how important our league is right now. Obviously, that falls on head coaches, coordinators, quarterbacks and players in general. Is it fair or unfair? Who cares? That's the world we live in, and you have to be able to deal with it.\"\n\nRyan said he couldn't change the play-call either.\n\n\"It just doesn't operate like that in football,\" Ryan said. \"You have a personnel grouping that's out on the field that could change or limit your number of plays.

{"text": "Contents show]\n\nTitan Publishing Group — parent company to both Titan Books and Titan Comics — is a book and magazine publishing company which has enjoyed several different BBC Worldwide licenses to publish various DWU tie-in works.\n\nIn the 1990s, they published a number of Doctor Who scripts in the Doctor Who: The Scripts series, and thus gave fans their first glimpse at \"official\" versions of the scripts of some of the show's more popular serials, including the first publication of the unproduced script for The Masters of Luxor. These books were produced for the UK market but also received limited distribution in North America.\n\nTorchwood Edit\n\nFrom 2008 to 2010, Titan published Torchwood The Official Magazine, featuring behind-the-scenes articles and original comic strips and short stories based on the spinoff. Publications spun-off from the magazine included a graphic novel compiling the story arc COMIC: Rift War and the hardcover publication Torchwood The Official Magazine Yearbook in 2008. As with the script books, the magazine and spin-off publications were primarily produced for the UK market but were imported to North America by speciality retailers.\n\nFrom the summer of 2010 to early 2011, Titan's American branch published Torchwood: The Official Comic, which ran for six issues and reprinted most of the magazine's comic strips and short stories for North American audiences. [1] The first issue was cover-dated September 2010, but distributed in the summer. This comic was distributed in North America but not in the UK.\n\nIn issue #24 of Torchwood Magazine, Titan announced that due to BBC Worldwide realigning its promotions for Torchwood related to the 2011 broadcast of TV: Miracle Day, it was discontinuing publication of the magazine effective with issue #25. The US Torchwood comic was also cancelled before it was able to reprint all of the magazine's comic strips and short stories.\n\nTitan once again began publishing Torchwood material with the advent of Torchwood (2016), a wholly original comic book.\n\nDoctor Who comics Edit\n\nTitan returned to the Doctor Who franchise when it was announced in late 2013 that its American subsidiary had picked up the North American licence to publish original comics based upon Doctor Who after the expiry of IDW Publishing's contract with BBC Worldwide.[2]\n\nTitan Comics then began their Doctor Who run in July of 2014 with the publication of Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor and Doctor Who: The Eleventh Doctor, followed by the launch of Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor in October 2014.[3] Many issues of the second year of Doctor Who: The Eleventh Doctor featured the War Doctor instead of the Eleventh Doctor as the headlining Doctor. Doctor Who: The Road to the Thirteenth Doctor featured an original story with the Tenth, Eleventh, and Twelfth Doctor and a serialised story with those Doctors, which lead into Doctor Who: The Thirteenth Doctor.\n\nAll three series have been published concurrently in North American comic book shops, with digital editions available for purchase in Europe and the United States. In the United Kingdom, Doctor Who Comic, which had all three of these ongoing series inside, launched in February 2015. It was companioned by Doctor Who: Tales from the TARDIS, which reprinted miniseries stories, but eventually grew to print main series stories, succeeding Doctor Who Comic.\n\nTitan released a limited-run five-issue series Doctor Who: The Ninth Doctor(released April-December 2015) to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Ninth Doctor's first appearance in the episode Rose. A year later, it was renewed as an ongoing series. The Ninth Doctor miniseries was followed by similar five-issue miniseries Doctor Who: The Eighth Doctor (released November 2015-March 2016),Doctor Who: The Fourth Doctor (released March-September 2016), Doctor Who: The Third Doctor (released September 2016-February 2017) and Doctor Who: The Seventh Doctor (released June-August 2018).\n\nThe ongoing Doctor Who comic books have crossed over in three miniseries events: Four Doctors in August-September 2015, Supremacy of the Cybermen in July-November 2016, and The Lost Dimension in August-October 2017. Titan has also published a few one-shots for special occasions: Free Comic Book Day 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 as well as San Diego Comic-Con specials in 2015, 2016, and 2017. The Twelfth Doctor also re-encountered Grant and Lucy Fletcher in Ghost Stories, a digital (later physical) comic miniseries from 2016 to 2017.\n\nTitan Comics also republished IDW Doctor Who comic stories in The Tenth Doctor Archives, The Eleventh Doctor Archives, and Doctor Who Archives: Prisoners of Time."}
{"text": "Many men try to achieve the appearance of having a thicker and fuller beard for a variety of reasons. Maybe they have dreams of competing in a men's beard competition, or maybe its purely for the aesthetic reasoning. Either way, it's undeniable that some men do go through issues regarding the growth of their facial hair. The combination of having too early, a less than par skincare routines, and a poor diet can make any man's beard look patchy, or just simply weak.\n\n\nSince beards are coming back in style and many are associating them with power and masculinity, it's not a shocker to know that a variety of men want to grow a fantastic, thick, beard. There are some generic reasons why some men's beards are thicker than others, and there are a few tips that can help the possibility of your bread becoming thicker.\n\nBefore getting into the variety of tips, the first step is to do a mental test of the qualities of your beard. You should separate them into three categories: thickness, length, and liveliness. Though out of all of these three categories, the hardest one to fix is thickness as it is mainly related to your genetics.\n\nHow does a beard appear to be thicker?\n\nWhile some men do have the luxury of being able to grow a thick beard within a couple of weeks, other men seem to be waiting a lifetime to get the desired look. While it may seem as if most men beards grown on different rates – a majority is actually grown in a similar time span.\n\nThe three factors that give the appearance of a man having a thicker bear is the colour of the beard (mainly when it appears darker), the overall density, and the length of the beard and hair follicles. While genetics do play a major role in your beard thickness, just making simple changes to your daily routine can help increase the overall health of your beard and finally give you the look that you've been looking for.\n\n1. Adopt a Better Skin Care Routine\n\nWhile it may not be the most masculine thing to change – its true. Having better and healthier skin will lead to a healthier and thicker beard. Other than making your skin look more pleasant to touch and view, finding a good moisturiser and cleanser can help your beard in more ways than one.\n\nThe act of cleansing and moisturising your face on a daily basis (once in the morning and once before bed), will help stimulate circulation throughout your hair follicles, along with exfoliating and getting rid of dead skin cells that could be causing a delayed growth with your beard. On the other hand, moisturising will keep your skin hydrated enough to grow thicker hair without the added itchiness.\n\n2. Pick Up Cardio\n\nHaving excess weight can stunt the growth of your bead due to it meaning that you most likely have an unhealthy lifestyle. Exercising is known to help stimulate beard growth and make you feel more confident. However, cardio has been studied to be the best exercise to incorporate.\n\nSome of the most popular cardio workout, such as running, biking, and dancing have been proven to help your beard grow faster as well. This is due to an increase in testosterone – which is needed to promote hair follicles becoming stronger along with growth. It also stimulates blood circulation within the body that has a variety of benefits.\n\n3. Be less Stressed\n\nIt's a fact that stress can lead to a variety of issues in your life. Stress has the power to impact your physical appearance by making you look more agitated, and that can have an impact on the appearance and lustre of your beard. To be a bit scientific, stress will affect your cortisol which in turn creates a negative relationship with your body's testosterone creation. Along with creating issues with your blood vessels – stress is just a big negative you need to get rid of.\n\nBoth kinds of stress, short-term, and long-term can make your beard grown in patchier or less dense. Although having a bad sleep schedule that is caused stress makes the challenge of growing a beard more of a hassle. While getting rid of stress is a personal issue that must be solved, mediation and stress relieving techniques will help you and your beard our tremendously.\n\n4. Create a Better Diet\n\nHaving a diet that is filled with vitamins and good nutrients can help the growth of your beard. This can be created by eating more veggies, fruits, and healthy meats – such as fish and chicken. A few of the recommended foods that you should begin eating weekly are eggs, healthy greens, and a variety of nuts without the added salt or sugar. This simple step will help your beard look more thick along with giving you more energy throughout the day."}
{"text": "It's not funny to treat your daughter as if she has zero common sense.\n\nA well-meaning father took pictures with his arms around his daughter's Homecoming date, mimicking the couple's pose. A comment was later added, and the picture posted on social media.\n\n\"Whatever you do to my daughter, I will do to you.\" The original article came out on a Fox News affiliate in Orlando, and was dubbed \"hilarious.\"\n\nThe full story is that both families were at the photo shoot and it was intended to be a joke, okay'ed by everyone involved. Therein, I'm not trying to judge this particular story, more use it as an example of the old-fashioned norms in which we continue to mindlessly participate.\n\nWhile the role of overprotective father is not a new one, it is a tired concept that needs to just die, already. Aside from the assumption that my daughter (yes, I also have daughters) is incapable of good judgment and protecting herself and her standards, this ridiculous concept imagines my sons likewise incapable of the same good judgment and standards.\n\n\"But I've been/known a teenage boy.\" You say. \"I know how they think.\" Which is total baloney.\n\nBecause here's the thing — thoughts are not equal to actions. And rationalizing that young men have overwhelming urges that cloud their judgment and force them to make poor decisions regarding young women is nothing more than excusing bad behavior.\n\n\"Boys will be boys\" needs to STOP.\n\nMy oldest son is 16 and his life does not need to be threatened when he takes his date out for dinner. My son is 16 and yet he has enough sense to be respectful to his grandmother, his mother, his sisters, and, amazingly, his girlfriend.\n\nI, as his mother, take offense to the thought that he is some hormone-drunk sloppy boner-machine (man he's going to hate me for writing that phrase in a public forum) who is completely blinded to good sense and morality. I have raised my son to be respectful and responsible young man, and he portrays those qualities in outside situations, as well.\n\nIt's not \"funny\" to threaten my son. It's not \"cute\" to treat your daughter as if she has zero common sense.\n\nIf you'd like to protect your daughter, raise her in such a way that she can protect herself. Give her the tools to decipher a dangerous situation. Teach her the language of consent and how to exit a situation that makes her uncomfortable. Help her be confident about her decisions, and show her how to make good choices about the people she spends time with. Take the time and be involved in her life.\n\nProtect your son in the same ways. And, for goodness sake, if you have good reason to distrust their judgment, make sure their activities are safe and monitored.\n\nAbove all, realize and come to terms with the fact that teenage sexuality is not a \"boy thing.\" Teenage sexuality is a teenage thing. Young men and young women alike are going to be curious, interested, and looking to learn more about sex.\n\nYour daughter is just as curious as my son, I can virtually guarantee it. Yet you don't see me polishing a shotgun when she comes over to do homework. You don't see me posting pictures on Facebook with watered-down threats about personal harm should I find out she gets handsy with my son.\n\nThe idea of threatening young women to keep their hands off young men is ludicrous, yet when roles are reversed it's completely accepted and even encouraged. Why? In order to raise a generation of kind and respectful men we have to stop telling our boys they're inherently bad (but it's not their fault because hormones).\n\nIn order to create a culture of strong and competent women who can save themselves, we must first stop teaching girls that they need to be saved.\n\nWhy don't we, as parents, mutually do our best to raise responsible and capable children instead? Why don't we guide our children to better choices, and help them learn how to recover when (not if) they screw up?\n\nWhy don't we remember that this is all part of the process and focus on the examples we're setting for them and the messages they're receiving at home? Then maybe we could all take a collective deep breath and be more confident in the kids we've raised.\n\nKasey Ferris is a freelance writer and mother of five.

{"text": "Photo: Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe risk of a major cyberattack on the nuclear industry is rising, potentially leading to blackouts or even meltdowns, researchers say.\n\nThe 2010 Stuxnet worm's infiltration of Iran's nuclear program was the most dramatic cyberattack the nuclear sector has ever seen. But it was not the only one. In one case in 2003, the Slammer worm infected the Davis-Besse nuclear power plant in Ohio, leaving reactor core safety data unavailable for nearly five hours. In another example from 2014, hackers stole blueprints of at least two nuclear reactors and other sensitive data from Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power Co., then demanded money from the company in exchange for not releasing potentially important files.\n\nAlthough the 2011 nuclear disaster at Fukushima was not the result of a cyberattack, that catastrophe nevertheless underscored what the grave consequences of disrupting a nuclear power plant can be. To shed light on what risks the nuclear industry now faces from cyber-threats, researchers at Chatham House, part of the the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London, conducted in-depth interviews of 30 nuclear industry experts and convened three expert roundtables on nuclear cyber-security over the course of 18 months.\n\nThe results, detailed on 5 Oct., were alarming, says study lead author Caroline Baylon, a research associate at Chatham House. \"I didn't expect to find as many vulnerabilities as I did,\" she says. \"The nuclear industry is not mature at all when it comes to cyber-security—it's barely starting to deal with the issue.\"\n\n\"A cyberattack that takes two or three nuclear power plants offline could definitely cause major blackouts in the United States,\" says Baylon. \"And if you look at a country like France, where 60 to 70 percent of its power comes from nuclear, a cyberattack could be even more serious.\"\n\nFor instance, the researchers found that the conventional belief that all nuclear facilities are \"air-gapped,\" or isolated from the public Internet, is a myth. In recent years, many nuclear facilities have developed some form of Internet connectivity so nuclear plants can transmit data to, say, the head offices of those nuclear facilities, or to government regulatory agencies. The 2003 infection of the Davis-Besse nuclear plant with the Slammer worm happened when the malware spread over virtual private networks (VPN) connecting the nuclear plant with the home laptop of an engineer working for a subcontractor.\n\nEven when nuclear facilities are air-gapped, this safeguard can be overcome with nothing more than a flash drive. This was the most likely route by which the Stuxnet worm infected the Iranian nuclear program.\n\nIn addition, nuclear plant personnel typically do not understand cyber-security procedures, often because the procedures are not clearly written. Furthermore, nuclear plant personnel often do not regularly practice cyber-security procedures in drills.\n\nThe researchers note that the nuclear industry adopted digital systems relatively late. One reason involved regulatory restrictions; another involved the very high costs of running nuclear plants, which meant that equipment in nuclear facilities is often kept in service for decades instead of replaced regularly. Baylon and her colleagues suggest the nuclear industry's delay in adopting digital systems resulted in a lower level of cybersecurity experience than is the case in other industries. They also suggest the nuclear industry's longstanding focus on physical safety and protection may have contributed to less attention to cybersecurity.\n\nIn light of these findings, the researchers propose a number of recommendations to improve nuclear cybersecurity. For example, they suggest that governments can establish computer emergency response teams specialized in defending industrial control systems. Nuclear facilities can also anonymously share reports of cyberattacks against them in order to raise awareness of threats while protecting their reputations. The researchers also suggest that nuclear facilities promote \"good IT hygiene,\" including practices such as changing the factory default passwords on equipment, and making certain that there are manual backups for critical systems in the event of a failure.\n\nThe worst-case scenario the researchers analyzed—a cyberattack that triggered the release of radioactive material—may not be an immediate threat. \"Such an attack is on the level of states against states, such as the U.S. and Russia and the U.K, which have a sort of gentleman's agreement to not attack each others' nuclear power plants,\" Baylon says. \"Almost no state wants to open that can of worms right now, although with rogue states like North Korea, no one ever knows what they might do.\"\n\n\"For me, the really scary scenario is when a well-financed terrorist group like ISIS meets a hacker-for-hire company like the kind seen in Russia that may be extremely sophisticated and not have a lot of ethics,\" Baylon says. \"We need to address the cyber-security vulnerabilities in the nuclear sector immediately.\""}

{"text": "Washington (CNN) A battle is being waged within Florida Sen. Marco Rubio 's campaign about whether he should even remain in the Republican presidential race ahead of his home state primary on March 15 , sources say.\n\nRubio himself is \"bullish\" on his odds of winning the critical primary, despite some advisers who are less hopeful and believe a loss there would damage him politically in both the short- and long-term.\n\nPublicly, the campaign is maintaining they are still a contender in this race, touting a Sunday win in Puerto Rico's primary that delivered Rubio 23 delegates. But privately, the campaign is having a debate about whether he should remain in the mix -- even for his home state of Florida's primary.\n\n\"He doesn't want to get killed in his home state,\" one source familiar with the discussions said, noting \"a poor showing would be a risk and hurt his political future.\"\n\nAlex Conant, Rubio's communication director, said the report of such an internal debate is \"100% false.\"\n\n\"That is fiction,\" he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on \"The Situation Room.\"\n\n\"I was sitting in a senior staff meeting planning out next week's schedule when I saw this report suddenly air and I came racing across town to correct it,\" he added.\n\nConant pointed to the fact that Rubio appears to be closing in on GOP front-runner Donald Trump 's lead in Florida.\n\nA Monmouth poll released Monday shows Rubio behind Trump, 38% to 30%. A Quinnipiac poll released two weeks ago put Rubio behind Trump by a wider margin: 44% to 28%.\n\nMost of the senator's advisers agree he does not have a path to the nomination and some are advising him to get out ahead of the March 15 primary.\n\nSources within the campaign also say the pressure will only continue to mount following an expected disappointing showing Tuesday, when voters in Michigan, Mississippi, Hawaii and Idaho make their picks in the GOP primary.\n\n\"Not going to have a great day is an understatement,\" one campaign source said.\n\nWeighing the costs\n\nThere are two lines of thought within the campaign: getting out before Florida, and hanging in there.\n\nOn the one hand, some advisers are warning that if Rubio does poorly in his home state, it could not only hurt his presidential campaign but also his future politically, including a potential gubernatorial run in 2018 or chance to be on the ticket as a vice presidential candidate.\n\n\"Cruz won his home state. If Rubio can't win his, that's a problem,\" one prominent supporter said.\n\nBut others within the campaign are urging Rubio to stay in the race, predicting a better-than-expected finish in Florida.\n\nRubio's victory for his Senate seat against the governor makes him optimistic he can come from behind, said one source close to the campaign. The senator also believes his experience in the state translates to a superior ground game and infrastructure than that of his competitors.\n\nThe latter line of thinking seems to be winning, for the moment. But a particularly awful Tuesday could change the rationale, a source warned.\n\nThe endorsement game\n\nOne potential x-factor in the Florida contest is the looming possibility of an endorsement from once-rival Jeb Bush . But Rubio and Bush, the former Florida governor, have spoken three times since Bush dropped out of the 2016 last month and the Rubio campaign is not expecting an endorsement.\n\nRubio raised the possibility in the latter two conversations, sources said, but felt Bush was \"vague about his interest\" and Rubio came away under the impression that Bush would not endorse.\n\nThe fellow Floridian is a long-time friend and mentor of Rubio's, but they clashed as opponents during the GOP primary. Many of Bush's backers endorsed Rubio after the former governor departed the race, and others who had stayed out of it put their support behind Rubio.\n\nBut not all of Bush's supporters moved over, and some talk of bad blood has hung over the relationship between the two campaigns.\n\nRomney role\n\nOther political insiders are closely watching to see what former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney decides to do. The 2012 GOP nominee delivered a speech last week excoriating Trump -- but he did not endorse any of the remaining Trump rivals.\n\nRomney is going to continue with that anti-Trump campaign, a source close to the former governor said, adding that while he is not running, he is open to the possibility -- however remote -- of stepping into a brokered convention as a consensus pick.\n\nSources familiar say that Romney isn't working with any of the non-Trump campaigns, but part of his resistance to throwing his support behind one is to leave his own options open."}
{"text": "Mauricio Pochettino's era has seen vast changes in significant areas at Tottenham: The huge improvement of key players such as Danny Rose & Kyle Walker; a stronger backbone, solidified defence and a young hungry team with strong influence from the academy – the list goes on. However, most importantly has been the change of culture he's helped cultivate at the club.\n\nYou need only to go back a few years ago to remember the chaos that surrounded the Sherwood era. Rumours of player unrest and brimming tension behind the scenes – Tottenham's culture was in need of an overhaul. Fans were split and the discontent and glum loomed large over White Hart Lane.\n\nMost importantly has been the change of culture Pochettino has helped cultivate at the club\n\nFast forward to present day and a complete contrast to those darker times is apparent. Look at the abundance of key players signing new deals, our one and only Harry Kane stating he would 'love' to stay at Tottenham Hotspur for the rest of his career and the connection felt between all key stakeholders at the club . There has been a radical overhaul in the culture of the club, and I believe how the club is perceived and thought of by our own players.\n\nFor so long, our very best players have hit their heights at Spurs, only to then go looking for bigger and better clubs – clubs which will 'prosper' their career and take them to the next level. Look at Dimitar Berbatov, Luka Modric and Gareth Bale as recent examples of this. Now, however, we have players who believe in Pochettino's project, they want to be key figures in this journey and can sense something special could happen at this club. Most importantly to me as a fan, is seeing these players desperate to play in the lilywhite shirt – they're not playing for themselves – they truly are a cohesive unit, working together towards a common goal.\n\nThrough this change in culture, we are no longer a team with a soft edge. We fight until the last minute.\n\nPochettino stated recently that the club only extended players' contracts who were desperate to stay, who believed in the ideas. Gone are the days of offering a contract in desperation of fending off a bigger club who our player is desperate to move to. Through strong leadership, Pochettino and his comrades have installed a desire to play for Tottenham – a project they do not want to miss out on, a project they believe can take their careers to the next level without seeking a 'bigger' move.\n\nExternal perceptions have also changed. Just recently I had a conversation with a friend who supports Manchester City. He couldn't believe the transformation Tottenham had taken under Pochettino's watch. There was almost a jealous tone to his words, that Tottenham had grown in stature as a club, all through wise management and a strong philosophy and without spending ridiculous money which his club so often has in recent years – money that can fabricate success. It's refreshing to hear from other fans and helps solidify to me that Tottenham truly are on the right track.\n\nThrough this change in culture, we are no longer a team with a soft edge. We fight until the last minute, the belief is high within this young group. Players need to be ambitious and Pochettino encourages this within his players. Teams no longer come to White Hart Lane expectant of an easy game – it is clear that we are a team that means business and can be unstoppable in the Premier League when we truly hit our straps (ask Manchester United about those seven minutes last season.)\n\nPlayers want to be key figures in this journey and can sense something special could happen at this club\n\nA healthy culture is so important to a successful sports team – look at the toxicity that brewed under Mourinho in his most recent reign at Chelsea. Yes he won another title, but at what cost? The season that followed was the worst defence of a Premier League title ever. They had players disinterested, and a group of snakes eager to see the back of him. Now, Chelsea have to rebuild – yes they have deep pockets to reach into which may speed up the process, however it was all because of the mess their culture created.\n\nAs a fan of this great club, I am so hopeful. It is a bright time for Tottenham Hotspur and the future looks even better. You only have to look at the 85,000 that went to Wembley to support our team to see the significant transformation this club has undertaken. Now the hope is that the fruition of all this positivity and change in culture is silverware – with the plans in place and the club in the hands of one of the best managers its ever had, the glory glory days may well be on the horizon."}

Now, sub-themes should be somewhat related to the main theme and you're not supposed to have hundreds of them. Well, some blogs have and it's pretty annoying. For instance, I recently subscribed to a blog because I read a couple of articles on living in Montreal. But then, the blog switched to OS systems, YouTube videos and cars. Err… no thanks, I unsubscribed. Same goes with blogs endlessly reposting videos and memes. You need some original content!\n\nGrammar, people, grammar! — A lot of bloggers are not native English speakers but choose to write in that language, including me. I'm sure I make my share of grammatical mistakes and I often wonder what I sound like to a native speaker. To make sure reading my articles is as painless as possible, I use spell-check and I review and proofread everything. So what if the occasional mistake slips through? I'm pretty confident you understand me, right? Yet, some bloggers, including native speakers, choose to ignore the fundamentals of language, like paragraphs and punctuation. I don't know how you feel about it but I have a lot of problem reading huge blocks of text when there isn't a single punctuation mark, including caps. You want people to read you? Then make it easy for them.\n\nToo much ads, no content — Like I recently wrote, I do monetize my blog. I have a few ads, hopefully relevant and non-intrusive. Most of us do have some kind of advertising program going on. After all, blogging takes time and energy and we are offering a service. That said, I don't think blinding your readers with ads is wise. I personally stay away from any blog that uses pop-ups. I simply hate when a website disables the back button to force you to stay on that page—it's a cheap trick. And if you start having more sponsored posts than genuine articles, don't expect me to tag along. I want to read article from a real person, not corporate speak.\n\nAm I talking to a wall? — Blogging is about interacting, and bloggers should never forget that their success depends on readers. If a reader made an effort to add to the discussion, please acknowledge it. No one is perfect and, like I said before, I reply to all comments but it sometimes takes me a little bit of time, and occasionally a comment slips through. If the number of comments is overwhelming, some blogger chose to \"talk\" to their readers in a follow-up article. It doesn't matter how you do it, but please, do acknowledge your readers. There is nothing worst than talking to a wall. In short, don't encourage comments if you don't care about them.\n\nWow, that's some bad design! — Blog design is a personal choice. You simply can't please everyone: some like it minimalistic some like to make a bold statement, some blogs put a lot of effort into design and others use standard templates and themes. That's fine! Now, you still want to make sure users can actually read your blog. For instance, I'd love people to realize that green font on black background equals headache. That the dozen of widgets you stacked at the bottom of your page make my browser crash. That I really don't want some music to start automatically when I open your blog.\n\nWhat are your blog turn-offs? What makes you click the \"unsubscribe\" button?"}
{"text": "Looking drained and sporting a prison buzz cut, political activist Joshua Wong is trying to put a brave face on the tribulations facing Hong Kong's democracy movement.\n\n\"Hong Kong has entered an era where those who fight for democracy and free elections will be put in prison,\" the 21-year-old tells the Financial Times, several days after he was released on bail 69 days into a six-month sentence for his role in kick-starting the 2014 Occupy protests. \"But I still see hope because even people who are not ready to face life in prison are ready to show their support.\"\n\nAs he prepares for his possible return to prison, Wong admits that Beijing's intensifying crackdown has left activists with fewer avenues for resistance and higher penalties for defying the authorities.\n\n\"We don't have concrete plans on how to get universal suffrage from Beijing,\" he says, as he sips on a Coke and expresses relief at his chance to \"taste freedom\" now that he is out of jail, where he could only drink water.\n\nBeijing — and the semi-autonomous Hong Kong government — was taken aback by the scale of the Occupy protests and a subsequent movement led by young Hong Kongers such as Wong that called for self-determination or even independence for the city.\n\nOver the past two years the authorities have hit back with a widening crackdown that has seen booksellers kidnapped and taken to the mainland, outspoken lawmakers ousted from the Legislative Council and, in August, more than a dozen young protesters including Wong jailed for unlawful assembly.\n\nThe campaign has put the democracy movement on the back foot and stoked broader fears about the erosion of the autonomy and civic freedoms promised to the former British colony for 50 years when it was handed over to China in 1997.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping has warned that he will not allow Hong Kong to be used to subvert the authority of the government, with other top officials saying the city's autonomy is at risk if this continues.\n\nLau Siu-kai, the vice-president of the Chinese government's think-tank on Hong Kong and Macau affairs, says the \"rules of the game\" are changing for Hong Kong, as Beijing reasserts its authority.\n\n\"Beijing will assume a bigger role in securing sovereignty, national security and its development interests instead of relying on the Hong Kong government and people,\" he says. \"In this situation, a serious fight between Beijing and some in Hong Kong is inevitable.\"\n\nMr Lau says Beijing will step up its propaganda efforts in Hong Kong, boost the role of \"patriots\" in the city and use tools of direct influence in Hong Kong's mini-constitution, including the power to \"interpret\" local laws and force the local government to implement its directives.\n\nThe Hong Kong government, led by chief executive Carrie Lam, has dismissed claims that the city is entering an \"authoritarian\" era and insists it will set aside controversial political problems to focus on livelihood issues such as the high cost of housing.\n\nBut, speaking privately, several senior Hong Kong officials admit that if the city cannot curb calls for independence and self-determination, which are anathema to Beijing, the Chinese government will further intensify its interventions.\n\nKevin Carrico, a lecturer in Chinese studies at Australia's Macquarie University, says activists are \"tired and not sure what to do to reverse these trends\".\n\n\"As there's this gradual tightening in one field after another, we'll eventually see a situation where there's no way out but moving to Taiwan or somewhere else,\" he says.\n\nJoshua Wong, a Hong Kong student activist, is arrested after a protest in June 2017 © EPA\n\nIn Wong's case, he will be sent back to jail next week if he fails to win leave to appeal his sentence for illegal assembly, after he and a group of protesters stormed a square in front of a government building in 2014. Upcoming court hearings related to Occupy could lead to more pro-democracy politicians being jailed and further prison sentences for Wong and some of his allies.\n\nFor now, he is enjoying his freedom, playing computer games, getting reacquainted with his smartphone and using chopsticks, knives and forks — which were banned in prison for fear of self-harm.\n\nBut as he struggles to divide his time out of prison between his political activities and his family and friends, Wong calls for his fellow Hong Kongers to think of the lesser-known activists facing much longer jail sentences.\n\n\"It's ironic that I'm the one serving the least time but I get the most coverage,\" he says. \"That's why I felt uncomfortable when I got bail. Don't just focus on the one identified as a hero.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Nicolle Liu"}
{"text": "Dear Parent of the Average Child,\nI'm sorry. Your child is wonderful.  She is always at school on time, does her homework most everyday, works well on her own and is patient with those around her.  I really wanted  to go tell your daughter how proud of her I was of the work she was doing today.\nI was about to but you see I had a young girl  over in the corner crying because she hadn't had breakfast. Another was tromping around the classroom in winter boots. It's May. When I asked her to change she told me she didn't have any other shoes. I needed to send them and my CEA down to the office to see if we had some food and any extra shoes in lost and found. \nOh and over in the other corner there was a  boy screaming at the top of his lungs because, well no one is sure why. He is on a list to see a specialist, they hope to have a plan in place for him soon. Of course it has been 3 months, but the specialist teacher is overworked and only at our school a few days a week so we have to be patient. \nMore children trickled in. One girl told me that her backpack is at Mom's but she was at Dad's last night. He forgot to send a lunch. She also wanted to tell me about her Dad's new girlfriend but she told me I wasn't  to tell mom because it's was secret.  A young man tells me his cat died last night. Another lost a tooth! Exciting until he sees the blood, thenthe fear sets in.\nA child came in a little late looking afraid and tentative. She watched carefully what was going on but was too afraid to join in.  Everyone agrees that the child's fears aren't normal and that she needs some counselling but there are only so many hours in a day. They might be able to see her for one or two sessions next month. I started to head over to help her. Your daughter, wonderful child that she is, helps her put away her things and leds her to her desk. \nI was about to head over and say thank you but I notice 3 boys in the corner playing rough. I ran over to stop them and have a conversation about expected behaviour at school. I also tried to throw in a lesson on non-violence while I was at it.\nI turned back to look for your daughter. I haven't forgotten that I wanted to check in with her but I look up and realise I should probably begin teaching the lesson of the day. I told myself I would check in with her later. \nThis was all before 9am. Many other things  happened during the day that made it very difficult for me to check in with your wonderful daughter.  Students with learning disabilities, diagnosed and not diagnosed. Students with special needs and with behaviour problems. Students who are needier or put up their hand more often. Students who yell louder.\nI realised after a day of running from child to child and crisis to crisis, I never did get a chance to check-in with her today. I don't mean to leave your daughter alone but she seems to be doing just fine without me. I hope it is true. I'm sorry. I feel terrible. Would you mind telling her how proud I am of her? Let her know I appreciate her? I will check-in with her tomorrow.\nFrom Your Child's Teacher\nAuthors Note:\nI have 23 little treasures in my room. I care about them all. I want to teach them all and see them all succeed. I've had more days like this one than I would like to admit. When I think about a classroom without class limits or I think about a school system with even less specialist teachers and less services for our students, I worry. I wonder how many average kids go unseen everyday. I honestly don't think I can do this job under those conditions. Somedays I wonder how I do it now.  I know for a fact I won't be able to do it well.  \nPlease, please please understand how important this issue is.  I didn't become a teacher for the paycheck or the glory. I became a teacher because I wanted to help kids do amazing things with their lives.  I want that for all my students. I want to do my job well. That means that I need the tools to do that. This includes a reasonable class size and help from specialist teachers. That is why I'm willing to take a 10% pay cut and walk out inspite of the threats. For me isn't about the money. Its about the kids."}
{"text": "Employee Benefits: Will Paid Sick Leave Increase Absenteeism?\n\nBy: Melanie Berkowitz, Esq.\n\nWhen it comes to employee benefits, a paid sick leave policy raises questions for all types of businesses.\n\nWill the law increase absenteeism? How much will it cost? Is it complicated to coordinate paid sick leave benefits with other types of paid leave?\n\nFor smaller businesses that lack a formal HR department and who struggle with employee performance and absenteeism, these concerns can be daunting.\n\nThe good news: a little advance planning and clear employment policies will help minimize the burden on employers.\n\nPaid Sick Leave: A Growing Trend in Employee Benefits\n\nWith Connecticut recently becoming the first state to require employers to give their service workers paid sick leave, businesses all over the country are taking notice.\n\nWhile the CT law will require businesses with at least 50 employees to rethink their benefits and recordkeeping procedures, other states are considering their own variations on the law. California's legislature has introduced paid sick leave legislation three times since 2008, and Massachusetts lawmakers are currently considering their own version of the law.\n\nSimilar measures are gaining ground in other major cities including Denver and Milwaukee, while the mayor of Philadelphia recently vetoed a law passed by the City Council.\n\nSan Francisco and Washington D.C. have both had paid sick leave laws since 2007 and 2008, respectively. In contrast to Connecticut, San Francisco's paid sick leave law applies to businesses of all sizes.\n\nWhile state paid sick leave laws contain variations, all similarly offer most employees the right to accrue a number of days off with pay to be used for personal illness, family illness or doctor's appointments. Employees at small businesses generally accrue fewer paid sick days (if any) than employees at larger companies.\n\nAvoiding Absenteeism\n\nIn San Francisco, the law has expanded the population of workers entitled to paid sick leave to include those who traditionally never received it, such as part-time, temporary and service workers. These employees no longer have to choose between coming into work sick and getting a paycheck.\n\nBut what about those employees who take advantage of their new benefit, resulting in absenteeism -- just for a paid day off?\n\n\"Abuse is easier to curtail if your written leave and absenteeism policies define employee responsibilities clearly,\" advises Christian Rowley, San Francisco employment attorney at Seyfarth Shaw, LLP. \"Inform employees that you reserve the right to request a doctor's note to document an illness and require that foreseeable sick leave be requested as early as possible.\"\n\nRowley did not see a great increase in sick leave abuse after the San Francisco law was passed. \"Employees who falsely called in sick on a Monday or Friday (to extend their weekend) before the law was passed are still the ones most likely to cheat now,\" he says.\n\nThe penalties for employers who deny employees paid sick leave have made some businesses wary about questioning employees who seemed to have a lot of Monday and Friday \"illnesses,\" says Rowley. As with other employee disciplinary issues he says, \"careful documentation and consistency are key to supporting your actions.\"\n\nRowley also notes that for restaurant workers, there is little incentive to call in sick anyway. \"Tipped workers don't earn tips for days they don't work even if they get paid their base salary. So the financial burden from the law -- while there -- is not as large as many originally feared,\" he says.\n\nBalancing Work-life Benefits\n\nTeal Backus, Human Resources Generalist for Wentworth, Hauser and Violich, has managed paid sick leave for two very different San Francisco companies and seen it work in both environments.\n\nHer current company paid sick leave and vacation benefits beyond what the law required even prior to its passage, finding that it helps employees feel in control of their work-life balance. \"We rarely see abuse of the benefit,\" notes Backus. Yet employers who only provide what the law requires can promote a strong work-life balance for their employees.\n\nBackus cites her previous employer -- an aviation company -- as example. \"Rescheduling a flight crew is expensive, so we had to be very aware of absences surrounding first days on and last days off of rotations, which could signal leave abuse,\" she said.\n\nRather than resort to discipline, the company first revamped the way that pilots were scheduled, which allowed them to work more favorable hours and use their paid sick leave for true illness. \"Managing use of paid sick leave from an employee well-being perspective allowed us to address our workers needs first and then discipline continued abusers within our regular absence policy,\" explains Backus.\n\nThe result: a win-win for both employees and employers."}

She succumbed to her injuries several hours later.\n\nThe Virginian-Pilot — which referred to Beard, 30, by her birth name and used male pronouns to describe her — reported trans sex workers are known to work in the area where the shooting took place. The newspaper also noted that Beard over the last decade had been convicted of two prostitution-related charges.\n\nOfficer Daniel Hudson of the Norfolk Police Department told the Washington Blade on Thursday that investigators \"don't have any additional information\" about the circumstances that lead to Beard's death.\n\n\"It's still a preliminary investigation,\" said Hudson.\n\nTed Heck of the Virginia Anti-Violence Project told the Blade that Beard's sister told him that she was one of five siblings.\n\n\"They're very upset by the whole thing of course,\" said Heck.\n\nTrudylynne O'Brien, a trans woman and LGBT rights advocate who lives in Norfolk, told the Blade on Friday that she did not personally know Beard. She nevertheless mourned her death.\n\n\"I do share the hurt her friends and family may be feeling,\" said O'Brien. \"We transgender women face never-ending discrimination based on fear. Unfortunately it is solely based on not understanding or being able to accept another's persona.\"\n\nAdvocates criticize local police, media coverage\n\nThe National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs in a press release said Beard's death is the first murder of trans person of color to which it has responded this year.\n\nAn NCAVP report indicates 72 percent of the 18 victims of anti-LGBT murders the organization reported in 2013 were people of color. It notes 72 percent of the aforementioned victims were trans — and 67 percent of them were trans women of color.\n\nAt least a dozen trans women of color were reported killed in the U.S. last year. These include Kandy Hall and Mia Henderson who were murdered last summer in Baltimore.\n\n\"Lamia's death is a tremendous loss, and tragedy so early in the year is a painful reminder of the disproportionate violence that transgender women of color face,\" said NCAVP Research and Education Coordinator Osman Ahmed in a statement.\n\nLourdes Ashley Hunter, co-founder of the Trans Women of Color Collective who lives in D.C., agreed.\n\n\"The tragedy of hearing about Goddess Lamia Beard's untimely death is devastating for the entire trans community, but especially for the black trans community,\" Hunter told the Blade. \"Another one of our sisters lost to brutal violence. She was 30 years old.\"\n\nLGBT rights advocates criticized the Norfolk Police Department and local media outlets who identified Beard as a man.\n\n\"We at VAVP hope that throughout the investigative process, the media, police and the public at large will respect Lamia's gender identification and maintain a level of decorum and understanding when interacting with those individuals who identify within transgender and queer communities,\" said the Virginia Anti-Violence Project in a statement that specifically criticized the Virginian-Pilot over its coverage of Beard's murder. \"One of the first steps to ensuring that no further acts of violence are committed against individuals for perceived or stated sexual or gender identity begins with those who have access to wide audiences, public spaces and the ability to accurately educate the public at large about sensitive issues.\"\n\nHunter blasted the Norfolk Police Department for highlighting Beard's criminal record.\n\n\"This framing reinforces the narrative that trans lives don't matter,\" Hunter told the Blade.\n\nVa. senators kill hate crimes reporting bill\n\nVirginia's hate crimes and anti-discrimination laws do not include gender identity and expression.\n\nThe Virginia Senate Courts of Justice Committee earlier this month killed state Sen.

{"text": "Women underestimate their attractiveness whereas men are overly complacent about theirs. Why the difference? It is tempting to imagine that this is simply a reflection of continuing power imbalances favoring men. Yet, there is a simpler explanation. Women care more about their appearance because looks are more consequential for them.\n\nIt is important to establish that feminine worries about physical attractiveness are not due to a general lack of that social psychologists see as emblematic of low social status in a society. As David Brooks (1) writes:\n\nFor decades, surveys indicated men had higher than women. But there is some evidence that the gap has narrowed or vanished. A 2011 study from the University of Basel based on surveys of 7,100 young adults found that young women had as much self-esteem as young men.\n\nDespite higher global self-esteem, women do not feel good about their appearance. This disconnect can be attributed, at least in part, to concerns about . According to Linda Jackson, \"Although females are more dissatisfied with almost all aspects of their bodies than are males, most of their dissatisfaction centers around weight issues, namely, around being too fat.\" (2, p.186)\n\nConcern about being overweight is unlikely to go away for two good reasons. The first is that overweight is becoming a bigger objective problem as time goes on. The second is that the slender standard gets more extreme as women make strides in careers and project an image of professional competence rather than stereotypical femininity(3)\n\nWhy women are more concerned about their appearance\n\nIn general, women are much more concerned about their appearance than men are. The key reason for this is that their appearance is central to how they are evaluated by others (2).\n\nThat phenomenon is often rejected as \"lookism\" but giving it an unpleasant name is not going to make it go away. We sometimes need to remind ourselves that we are an evolved species on this planet.\n\nThe evolutionary process of sexual selection changes us so as to attract mates. Men's facial hair makes them more sexually attractive to women, for instance. This is a sexual signal analogous to the brightly colored feathers of peacocks and other male birds. This phenomenon was revealed in experiments but most women seem unaware of it (3).\n\nHumans are rather unusual in the sense that sexual selection affected both sexes but apparently did more work on females than on males. This is consistent with a variety of evidence that women's physical appearance is more important for their success than is true of men (2).\n\nSexual selection altered female facial proportions making them more stereotypically youthful. For that reason, highly attractive women such as movie stars seem much younger than their actual age.\n\nThe cosmetics industry also labors to remove signs of age-related damage to the skin. The relevant is that with women are less likely to conceive and have less of their reproductive lives ahead of them. Men who selected youthful-looking women as spouses would thus have sired more children.\n\nThe other key sexually-selected of women is their hour-glass shape that inspired painters over the ages. This stereotypically feminine shape is also exaggerated in highly attractive women such as movie stars and pageant winners (3). It is crafted by so that women are most curvaceous during the most fertile years of their lives.\n\nThe operation of sexual selection on women has numerous practical consequences. Women are perceived as more attractive than men. They are also perceived as sexier which is why attractive women are more prominently featured in advertisements on the premise that sex sells.\n\nWomen also spend huge amounts of money on clothes, cosmetics, and other products and services that enhance their physical appearance. One might argue that this is further evidence of insecurity about their appearance produced by the burden of being evaluated by men based on their appearance (lookism).\n\nYet, men often evince a frustrating obliviousness to the beauty endeavors of their sweethearts. I never heard a man saying he wished that his girlfriend would spend more time and money on her appearance.\n\nThe truth is that women's insecurity about their appearance is driven by with other women. We see this quite clearly in connection with the slender standard of attractiveness where women wish to be more slender than men find attractive (3).

{"text": "enough for the state to prove that George Zimmerman acted unwisely in following Martin. Under Florida law, George Zimmerman had no responsibility to—at any point—retreat. The state must prove that Zimmerman had no reasonable fear for his life. Moreover, it is not enough for the jury to find\n\nZimmerman's story fishy. Again, the jury instructions:\n\nGeorge Zimmerman has entered a plea of not guilty. This means you must presume or believe George Zimmerman is innocent. The presumption stays with George Zimmerman as to each material allegation in the Information through each stage of the trial unless it has been overcome by the evidence to the exclusion of and beyond a reasonable doubt. To overcome George Zimmerman's presumption of innocence, the State has the burden of proving the crime with which George Zimmerman is charged was committed and George Zimmerman is the person who committed the crime. George Zimmerman is not required to present evidence or prove anything. Whenever the words \"reasonable doubt\" are used you must consider the following: A reasonable doubt is not a mere possible doubt, a speculative, imaginary or forced doubt. Such a doubt must not influence you to return a verdict of not guilty if you have an abiding conviction of guilt. On the other hand if, after carefully considering, comparing and weighing all the evidence, there is not an abiding conviction of guilt, or, if having a conviction, it is one which is not stable but one which wavers and vacillates, then the charge is not proved beyond every reasonable doubt and you must find George Zimmerman not guilty because the doubt is reasonable. It is to the evidence introduced in this trial, and to it alone, that you are to look for that proof. A reasonable doubt as to the guilt of George Zimmerman may arise from the evidence, conflict in the evidence, or the lack of evidence. If you have a reasonable doubt, you should find George Zimmerman not guilty. If you have no reasonable doubt, you should find George Zimmerman guilty.\n\nThis was the job given to the state of Florida. I have seen nothing within the actual case presented by the prosecution that would allow for a stable and unvacillating belief that George Zimmerman was guilty.\n\nThat conclusion should not offer you security or comfort. It should not leave you secure in the wisdom of our laws. On the contrary, it should greatly trouble you. But if you are simply focusing on what happened in the courtroom, then you have been head-faked by history and you have bought into an idea of fairness which can not possibly exist.\n\nThe injustice inherent in the killing of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman was not authored by a jury given a weak case. The jury's performance may be the least disturbing aspect of this entire affair. The injustice was authored by a country which has taken as its policy, for the lionshare of its history, to erect a pariah class. The killing of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman is not an error in programming. It is the correct result of forces we set in motion years ago and have done very little to arrest.\n\nOne need only look the criminalization of Martin across the country. Perhaps you have been lucky enough to not receive the above \"portrait\" of Trayvon Martin and its accompanying text. The portrait is actually of a 32-year old man. Perhaps you were lucky enough to not see the Trayvon Martin imagery used for target practice (by law enforcement, no less.) Perhaps you did not see the iPhone games. Or maybe you missed the theory presently being floated by Zimmerman's family that Martin was a gun-runner and drug-dealer in training, that texts and tweets he sent mark him as a criminal in waiting. Or the theory floated that the mere donning of a hoodie marks you a thug, leaving one wondering why this guy is a criminal and this one is not.\n\nWe have spent much of this year outlining the ways in which American policy has placed black people outside of the law. We are now being told that after having pursued such policies for 200 years, after codifying violence in slavery, after a people conceived in mass rape, after permitting the disenfranchisement of black people through violence, after Draft riots, after white-lines, white leagues, and red shirts, after terrorism, after standing aside for the better reduction of Rosewood and the improvement of Tulsa, after the coup d'etat in Wilmington, after Airport Homes and Cicero, after Ossian Sweet, after Arthur Lee McDuffie, after Anthony Baez, Amadou Diallo and Eleanor Bumpers, after Kathryn Johnston and the Danziger Bridge, that there are no ill effects, that we are pure, that we are just, that we are clean. Our sense of self is incredible. We believe ourselves to have inherited all of Jefferson's love of freedom, but none of his affection for white supremacy."}
{"text": "The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) is one of the first agencies established by the United Nations to administer refugees, preceding even the creation of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The long history of UNRWA has long been built around its original mandate. The mandate, initially given by UN General Assembly Resolution 302 (IV), has been updated over the years. Today, UNRWA promises to deliver services as a \"neutral human development agency,\" according to Chris Gunness, a spokesperson at UNRWA.\n\nUnfortunately, UNRWA has fallen prey to increasingly polarized and biased rhetoric, pushed more and more often by its own spokespersons. While Israel has raised concerns about Mr. Gunness in the past, there has been no action taken to ensure that Mr. Gunness is returned to the realm of unbiased behavior befitting a human development agency whose mandate, he admits, must include neutrality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Israeli letter to the UN Commissioner-General of UNRWA (Pierre Krähenbühl) details, Mr. Gunness has promoted and praised individuals who buy into the ideology of Hamas, an internationally recognized terrorist organization. Mr. Gunness has discussed the suffering of Palestinian refugees, but conveniently leaves out responsibility for their suffering, going so far as to omit the responsibility of Hamas in disrupting power to 70,000 Gazans by firing a rocket (a by-definition indiscriminate weapon) at Israel.\n\nHowever, Mr. Gunness has not only escaped investigation, he has persisted in his continued violations of the neutrality principle that underlines UNRWA's mandate. His prolific posts on Twitter are indication of this trend. On August 28, 2015, at 12:21AM (GMT-7), Mr. Gunness tweeted:\n\n\"Thx @levy_haaretz 4 exposing the pitilessness of the \"bureaucrats\" of #IsraeliOccupation\". They r many & variedhttp://www.haaretz.com/weekend/twilight-zone/.premium-1.673301 … RT\"\n\n(If embeddable, here is link to tweet: https://twitter.com/ChrisGunness/status/637163117051518976).\n\nThe \"bureaucrats\", unnamed figures in the article, are doubtless officials of the Israeli government. Rather than maintain an unbiased and neutral view of Israel, Mr. Gunness has both praised and taken immediate sides on an issue related to human interests without investigation of his own. He further accuses Israeli officials of \"pitilessness\", yet another insult towards the Israeli officials his organization is meant to cooperate with in an unbiased fashion. This conduct is unbecoming for any UNRWA official, let alone a spokesperson.\n\nAnother obvious example of Mr. Gunness' failures to remain unbiased can be found mere days before. On August 26, 2015, at 4:17PM (GMT-7), Mr. Gunness tweeted the following:\n\n\"Interested to find out more about UN Watch's political & financial affiliations since its establishment. Can anyone advise? RT\"\n\nHis tweet was not a legitimate and neutral attempt to investigate an organization, of course. Just a few days earlier, on August 23, 2015, UN Watch informed UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon that an UNRWA school had posted violence-inciting cartoons on its Facebook page.\n\nMr. Gunness' tweet thus reeks of attempted retaliation, and he solicited information from the social media world in his attempt to find information which he might, presumably, be able to smear UN Watch with. UN Watch, which is a Geneva-based non-governmental organization acting as a watchdog for the United Nations, has been praised by former UN Secretary Generals and other high-ranking officials for their work, and is an accredited NGO assisting numerous UN bodies. Rather than acknowledge the criticism of this UNRWA school and thank UN Watch for their work in keeping UNRWA accountable and neutral, Mr. Gunness decided to block and ignore UN Watch on Twitter.\n\nIn light of this, and numerous other documented examples of Chris Gunness' failure to be both accountable and neutral it is up to the United Nations to take action. Clearly the long history of bias and violations of UNRWA policy have failed to inspire the United Nations to take action, and it is time that the world called on the United Nations to appoint neutral, unbiased spokespersons for an agency crucial to the administering of aid for Palestinians. Only with a more neutral and diplomatic individual speaking on behalf of UNRWA can the organization continue to properly function and mediate between the parties of the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, and ensure that it is seen as a credible UN agency."}

{"text": ".\n\nExplosion That Injured at Least 29 an 'Intentional Act,' New York City Mayor Says (ABC News)\n\n.\n\nAn explosion that rocked Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood and injured at least 29 people appears to have been \"an intentional act\" -- but not related to terrorism, according to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.\n\nThe cause of the explosion has not been determined, said New York City police commissioner James O'Neill. The explosion, which seriously injured at least one person, happened on West 23rd Street late Saturday in an area frequented by shoppers and diners.\n\n\"New York City experienced a very bad incident,\" de Blasio said at a news conference. \"We have no credible and specific threat at this moment.\"\n\nA possible secondary device was located a few blocks away on 27th Street, between 6th Avenue and 7th Avenue, the NYPD Special Operations Division said at 11 p.m. The device, a pressure cooker, was removed by authorities. It was in a white plastic bag with tape, wiring and a cell phone or other electronic device.\n\nPolice said the device was to be detonated at the NYPD's firing range in the Bronx. Police had earlier advised residents on the block where the device was found to stay away from windows facing 27th Street.\n\nThere were other suspicious packages and incidents in the area since the pressure cooker was discovered, but they were deemed not dangerous, police said.\n\nBomb-sniffing dogs deployed in NYC's Chelsea neighborhood after reported explosion. Follow @ABC for latest. pic.twitter.com/fH6uF0hGqD\n\nThe explosion on 23rd Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues was seen by police officers driving by about 8:30 p.m., according to police. The fire department heard the explosion and responded immediately.\n\nOfficials said the NYPD has video it is reviewing and De Blasio urged any witnesses or people who may have information to come forward.\n\nTwo law enforcement sources said the explosion occurred in a dumpster, and the NYPD Counterterrorism Bureau tweeted a photo of a mangled dumpster after saying they were responding to the explosion.\n\nThe NYPD Bomb Squad was searching the area and checking garbage cans for any other possible explosive devices.\n\nThe FBI and Homeland Security officials, along with the ATF arson and explosive task force were also at the scene.\n\nSurveillance video recovered from West 23rd Street shows the explosion and contains other evidence that indicates to investigators the original object was intentionally left next to the construction trash container, described as 4 ft. by 4 ft. by 3 ft. in size.\n\nIn one video obtained by police, a man is seen crossing the street in the vicinity of where the original object was left. The trash container was blown clear into the street by the force of the blast.\n\nThe object left behind could be a large tool box, left next to one of the several commercial trash containers in front of a building that has been under construction. Investigators are trying to determine if there is a connection to this seemingly \"random construction site.\"\n\nThe explosion even startled residents who were a few blocks away. Chelsea resident Michelle Leifer was walking her dog in Madison Square Park when she heard a loud boom and rumbling. \"I heard a loud boom and felt rumbling,\" she tells ABC News. \"I wasn't sure if it was an explosion or if a large truck had gone by. One of the park's maintenance men came in and said he got an alert on his phone that there was an explosion on 23rd and 6th. As I was leaving the park, I saw a smoke cloud hovering in that area. Then police cars and firetrucks started streaming in.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a \"possible secondary device\" was located a few blocks away on 27th Street, between 6th Avenue and 7th Avenue, the NYPD Special Operations Division said around 11 p.m. The device, a pressure cooker, was removed by authorities. The device was in a white plastic bag with tape, wiring and a cell phone or other electronic device.\n\nThe explosion occurred one day after O'Neill was sworn as the new police commissioner following Bill Bratton's retirement.\n\nThe mayor said the Chelsea explosion has no apparent connection to the explosive device that detonated in Seaside Park, New Jersey, Saturday morning. Nobody was injured in the New Jersey incident, which occurred at a time when a 5k run to benefit U.S. Marines and sailors was scheduled, but the race was delayed because so many runners had signed up.\n\nSociety & Culture\n\nUnrest, Conflicts & War\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio\n\nNYPD\n\n.\n\n— Paul Blake (@PaulNBlake) September 18, 2016"}

{"text": "Hooters History\n\nThe 1990s\n\n1991\n\nIn the growing Hooters tradition of seizing opportunities, HOA President, Bob Brooks, spotted the un-sponsored up-and-coming owner/driver Alan Kulwicki. The two cut a deal for the last NASCAR race of 1991 in Atlanta. That great exposure blossomed into a full sponsorship the following year, which resulted in the little underdog nicknamed \"Mighty Mouse\" winning the prestigious Winston Cup at the Hooters 500 on the very track where it all started. His reverse victory lap became a signature.\n\n1993\n\nOn April 1, 1993 – ten years to the day of Hooters first incorporation – tragedy struck. While on a promotional trip carrying the Hooters colors, fan-favorite Kulwicki, along with Mark Brooks, Dan Duncan and Charlie Campbell, all perished when their plane crashed outside of Bristol, Tennessee. The system mourned its champions but came back with greater resolve to honor their memory.\n\n1995\n\nIn 1995, Hooters of America Chairman Robert Brooks, who lost his son Mark in the crash, decided to jump into late model, short track racing and established the USA Hooters Cup Racing Series. Today, the USAR Hooters Cup Series is the premier short track series, which includes 24 events that culminates with the Robert H. Brooks Memorial Hooters 300 at the USA Speedway in Lakeland.\n\nWith new units and sales steadily increasing, Hooters went international. Tranquility set in for a brief time until. . .the EEOC. After four years of investigating Hooters' policy of hiring only women to be Hooters Girls, the commission concluded that Hooters was discriminating against men by not hiring them to be Hooters Girls (huh?). In a move to protect the very essence of the concept, Hooters, Inc. and Hooters of America joined forces to bring their case to the world.\n\nSoliciting grassroots support from customers and supporters, the gang took the first \"Hooters Guy\" (a virile and scruffy Hooters manager by the name of Vince Gigliotti) and hundreds of thousands of written protests to Washington to protest the EEOC's investigation and findings. In a fluke of circumstance, the timing coincided with the government shutdown on November 15th, 1995. Hooters' plight was the top media story of the moment. (Another then not-so-publicized event occurred simultaneously while the Hooters Girls Marched on Washington – an intern was delivering a pizza to a certain oval office. Coincidence? Maybe. . . but the Hooters Girls did march past the White House earlier that day.)\n\nRepresentatives took the floor of Congress on Hooters' behalf. Newt Gingrich took a stand on Meet the Press, while Crossfire and editorials across the country took up Hooters' cause. The world responded, and finally, so did the EEOC. The future of the Hooters Girl was secured.\n\nAnd everyone rejoiced by eating the really good food at Hooters.\n\nNow, you may be asking yourself, what do John Daly, Tom Lehman, Jim Furyk, and David Toms have in common? Well, they all played in the NGA/Hooters Professional Golf Tour and, of course, have become household names on the PGA Tour. The NGA was an offshoot of the Jordan Tour that dates back to 1988. In 1994 Hooters CEO Robert H. Brooks joined forces with the Jordan Tour and it became the Hooters/Jordan Tour. In 1995 it became the Hooters NGA Hooters Pro Golf Tour and is currently the # 1 developmental professional tour in the country. The 2007 NGA Schedule includes 18 events with guaranteed $200,000 purses.\n\n1997\n\nAs Hooters' menu expanded, so did its fame. By 1997 the system boasted customers from all age groups and all walks of life. They are all folks who have found \"a cure for the common restaurant.\" Cures are even available in grocery stores across the country with the emergence of Hooters Foods Wing Sauce, Breading, Hot Sauce, and HOA's HooterAid.\n\nAs big as Hooters gets, they have never forgotten their roots and the communities they have prospered in. The system prides itself on its commitment to community and charity involvement by the restaurants and their wonderful employees. This commitment was necessary, unsurpassed . . . and so worth it.\n\nBesides, people love the food.\n\nHooters has sponsored a jet car, shovel racing, and its own Arena Football team that everyone loved to beat. Then came the racing tour, pro golf tour, a radio show, a college bowl game and is eagerly awaiting the premiere of its Hooters Movie – and you thought this was a story!\n\nSave"}
{"text": "During a Senate committee hearing Tuesday morning on Stand Your Ground laws, Republican supporters defended the notorious law made famous after the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin with broad pronouncements about the right to self-defense. \"If you're attacked on the street by a violent attacker, you're obliged to turn and run is a notion that is contrary to hundreds of years of our jurisprudence,\" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) proclaimed. But contrary to Cruz's assertion, the Stand Your Ground laws passed in more than 24 states cast aside several centuries-old principles of criminal law and self-defense. The following are four ways Florida's law actually flouts traditional criminal justice notions to instead encourage vigilantism, as explained by Harvard legal scholar Ronald Sullivan during testimony Tuesday:\n\n1. Stand Your Ground casts aside the long-held duty to retreat. When Sen. Ted Cruz says the obligation to run away from an attacker is contrary to precedent, he is referring to what is known as the \"duty to retreat.\" As Sullivan explains, the long-held principle that individuals must first attempt escape from a violent situation before using deadly force has been a bedrock of Anglo-American law for two centuries. There has long been one exception to this rule in some states known as the \"Castle Doctrine,\" which limits the duty to retreat in the home, on the rationale that one should not have to retreat from their own home. But in all other cases, the law has long asked individuals to minimize bodily harm and death as much as possible. That means they have a duty to retreat where they can do so safely. \"If it's unsafe to retreat, nowhere in our history is one required to retreat,\" Sullivan writes. Stand Your Ground laws completely eliminate this duty. Sullivan explained his written testimony:\n\nThis emboldens individuals to escalate confrontation, even deadly confrontation, whereas an alternative rule would decrease the likelihood of deadly exchanges. The Trayvon Martin matter is a case in point. The very existence of this law emboldened Mr. Zimmerman to disregard the command of the 911 dispatcher and follow Trayvon Martin, arrogating law enforcement — what should be a public function — to himself. This private law enforcement attitude, made possible and emboldened by Florida's Stand Your Ground law, coupled with a permissive concealed carry law, was the \"but for\" cause of Trayvon Martin's death. But for the fact that Zimmerman exited his vehicle that evening, Trayvon Martin would be alive today.\n\n2. The law grants blanket criminal and civil immunity. As Association of Prosecuting Attorneys President David LaBahn explains, criminal law rarely grants total, pretrial immunity. The few other circumstances in which total immunity is granted involve cooperation with law enforcement officers. In most cases, defendants can raise a self-defense claim at trial — when the facts and law are given a full airing, and where mitigating circumstances may yield conviction of a lesser criminal charge, such as involuntary homicide rather than murder. If a defendant requests a pretrial Stand Your Ground hearing, and the judge finds that the defendant reasonably feared imminent bodily harm, the judge can grant immunity from any and all charges before the trial begins. And in many cases, the law even provides immunity from arrest, as was initially the case with George Zimmerman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. The law presumes a killer's fear was reasonable. One seeming limitation on Stand Your Ground laws is that the killer must have reasonably feared bodily harm. But in Florida, as in several other states, the law now presumes reasonableness if that killing took place in one's home or vehicle. This was not a feature of the original Castle Doctrine. And it abrogates yet another of the fundamental limiting criminal law principles that took a back seat when the Stand Your Ground law was passed.\n\n4. The law fosters self-perpetuating violence. Promoting vigilantism is one consequence of Stand Your Ground laws. But as Sullivan warns, behavioral changes may not be limited to those who want the right to Stand Your Ground. Particularly given the facts of the Trayvon Martin case, he warns that young black boys motivated by fear of adults like George Zimmerman may feel compelled to Stand their ground, too, in a cycle of shoot first, or be shot. \"To be sure, this is not a world that I want my son to grow up in,\" Sullivan says. But if he lived in a Stand Your Ground state, he said, he would have no choice but to advise his own young black son, Trey, to \"shoot first\" and ask questions later if he feels threatened by a stranger. \"I would rather not counsel him in using lethal force when being profiled by vigilantes. That said, however, I would rather my Trey be alive and able to argue that he 'stood his ground' than dead and portrayed by lawyers and media alike as the personification of a stereotypical black male criminal.\""}

I can't believe you were t rying to \"educate\" people on this topic at a god damn panel.\n\nHell, t he Western market contributes to less than 1% of the anime industry and Westerners are probably one of the worst things for the industry. The majority of them practise piracy and don't spend a cent yet continue to complain about the quality of anime, demand that studios produce xyz and even whine when their free fansubs aren't released on express. I once saw some people on a Hourou Musuko post recommending that everyone use KissAnime instead of Crunchyroll because Crunchyroll didn't have a large selection (since it was legal and was a pay-to-use service created to support anime producers)…just how spoiled are you people?\n\nThere is no such genre called \"Girl Coming of Age\" and the \"Magical Girl\" genre was a huge contributing factor to the popularisation of moe (fanservice through infantilsation). Funny how you have Madoka and Sora no Woto listed as \"feminist series\" when they are both moe shows aimed towards adult males. Many people were discussing how Madoka was pretentious lolicon but no one on tumblr thought about the social context until Urobuchi's interview spread over to tumblr. Misty/Kasumi from Pokemon is still sexualised, she was often used for fanservice scenes (which may not have appeared in the English dubbed versions) and Pokemon's primary demographic is young males. This kind of \"innocent fanservice\" is very common among kodomo anime but again, you won't realise anything without being raised in the culture.\n\nI'm also rolling my eyes pretty hard at how you want anime to subvert gender roles but also believe anime is feminist for presenting girliness as a strength. Japan is a very conservative society and girls being encouraged to be feminine through children's TV is a way of keeping gender conformity. That's not a feminist message. There is so much pressure in Japanese society to follow these gender roles. A tomboy is seen as lacking in submissiveness and feminine charm and will often be told in her life that she will be unworthy of marriage and will never be a \"real woman\".\n\nThe standard for a \"girly girl\" is much higher in Japan and girls that don't reach it are viewed as \"manly\" since masculinity is the default. This was largely a result of Western imperialists threatening Japanese men (wow what a surprise) after the Meiji era. These Japanese men decided that they would have to become tougher and that they had to stop the \"feminization\" of their culture by instilling stricter roles onto the Japanese population.\n\nThis is reflected in video games such as Persona 4 where Naoto pretended to be a boy because she wasn't as feminine as society told her she should have been. She wanted to be a detective but to do that she would have to avoid being seen as a weak girl and to gain respect by posing as man. All you tumblr anime feminists went off to interpret her as a trans man and continued to piss on anyone that tried to tell you otherwise. Chihiro from Dangan Ronpa is another example of the problems with these strict gender roles. Don't project your Western values onto Japanese society.\n\nOften times tomboy may not be considered masculine from a Western perspective, and in fact very feminine instead. Many Japanese feminists are arguing for an abolition of gender roles on children's TV, they don't want presenting either masculinity or femininity as a strength. Japan is a traditionalist, homogeneous society with a deep focus on collectivism. If boys and girls were encouraged to focus on their own traits rather than doing just what their gender expected them then that would be pretty damn feminist."}

He added that 1,440 people had been wounded.\n\n\"Bu kalkışma silahlı kuvvetler içindeki paralel terör yapılanmasının bir kalkışmasıdır.\" pic.twitter.com/MlM1lREykK — AK Parti (@Akparti) July 16, 2016\n\nA Turkish army faction backed by tanks and fighter jets staged an attempted coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Saturday but the strongman returned to Istanbul defiantly claiming to have regained control.\n\nÇekilen bir videoda, insanların üzerine ateş açıldığı görülüyor. pic.twitter.com/d7LfagPsRc — 140journos (@140journos) July 15, 2016\n\nThe toll 161 did not include the assailants, he emphasised. Turkey's acting army chief Umit Dundar had earlier said 104 putschists had been killed.\n\nYildirim blamed the coup attempt on the supporters of US-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara has for years accused of working to overthrow the authorities and wants to see brought to justice.\n\nThe United States has shown little interest so far to Turkey's requests for his extradition.\n\n\"Fethullah Gulen is the leader of a terrorist organisation,\" the premier said.\n\n\"Whichever country is behind him is not a friend of Turkey and in a serious war against Turkey,\" he added.\n\nWorld powers urge 'stability' in Turkey\n\nErdogan predicted that the move would fail and crowds of supporters of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) came out onto the streets to try to block the putsch.\n\nCrowds of people, some waving Turkish flags, gathered in major squares in Istanbul and Ankara to show support for the elected government.\n\nAfter hours of chaos unseen in decades, the president ended uncertainty over his whereabouts, flying into Istanbul airport in the early hours of the morning where he made a defiant speech and was greeted by hundreds of supporters.\n\nErdogan denounced the coup attempt as \"treachery\" but said he was carrying out his functions and would keep on working \"to the end\".\n\n\"What is being perpetrated is a treason and a rebellion. They will pay a heavy price for this act of treason,\" Erdogan said at Istanbul's airport. \"We will not leave our country to occupiers.\"\n\nTurkish military chief rescued after being held during coup bid\n\nThe head of Turkey's armed forces was rescued after being held hostage during the attempted coup.\n\nHulusi Akar had been held by rebel soldiers during the attempted coup, Turkish broadcasters said.\n\nTurkey blames IS for Istanbul airport carnage that killed 41\n\nSocial media access restricted\n\nAccess was restricted in Turkey on Friday to Facebook Inc, Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc's YouTube shortly after news that a military coup was under way, according to two internet monitoring groups.\n\nTurkey Blocks, a group that monitors internet shutdowns in the country, and Dyn, which monitors internet performance and traffic globally, both reported it was difficult or impossible to access social media services in Turkey.\n\nFethullah Gulen, the arch-enemy of Turkey's president\n\nAfter serving as prime minister from 2003, Erdogan was elected president in 2014 with plans to alter the constitution to give the previously ceremonial presidency far greater executive powers.\n\nAttempted coup in Turkey: what we know so far\n\nTurkey has enjoyed an economic boom during his time in office and has dramatically expanded its influence across the region.

{"text": "Can something so healthy actually taste so friggin' good?\n\nUsually if something tastes really good, it means it's probably not that healthy for you. I'm thinking things like Nutella or fried chicken or ice cream. This is a weak generalization, but I think most of us grew up believing the point this graph conveys:\n\nOne day I'm exploring the world wide web for food related things, and I come upon NutrionFacts.org. The author of a blog claims that he has an antioxidant-packed tea recipe (very healthy) that tastes just like fruit punch (not healthy)!\n\nThis seems like a job for this blog to taste test this.\n\nDoes this video's recipe actually taste like fruit punch?\n\nHere is the video:\n\nLet me briefly mention antioxidants. It's the craze. Green tea has a lot of them. They help you stay healthy, fight heart disease, fight cancer, all of that. You should get them in your body, in moderation (I would be great at promoting proper nutrition to the masses).\n\nNote: while antioxidants are generally considered a good thing, one needs to realize that a high intake of antioxidants is not a cure-all, and even taking supplements may be questionable. To read more about the hype of antioxidants, read here. But certainly we can agree that a drink like the one below is better than most fruity drinks out there.\n\nAs this video claims, there are many drinks that have antioxidants, and many more than the antioxidant poster child: green tea. Two of the popular ones are macha tea, which I never had, or green tea powder, which I also never had. But there is something healthier than these two healthy drinks, apparently.\n\nWhat is better than macha, or green tea powder?\n\nAnswer: hibiscus tea.\n\nAnd here's the unbelievable part: NutrionFacts.org's blog claims to have a hibiscus tea recipe that \"tastes just like fruit punch\" and \"your kids will love it!\"* I wouldn't believe it until I tried it myself.\n\n*I don't have kids, and after I considered inviting random kids into my place and have them test out a mysterious red drink, I decided that would not be the greatest idea.\n\nHere is the recipe:\n\n1/2 gallon water or 8 cups\n\n4 bags of any tea which Habiscus is first ingredient\n\nJuice of one lemon\n\n4 tablespoons of blended dates or erythritol (a healthy sweetener that is kind of hard to come by, so I used Truvia which I at got at Whole Foods)\n\nInstructions: Cold brew in fridge overnight. Shake up, take out tea bags.\n\nThe next day, blend some fresh mint leaves in this brew (I tried both a food processor and blender, both yield the same results). Run this blend through a strainer and into cups you are serving to your guests.\n\nExperiment\n\nThis was a simple one. I served this hibiscus \"fruit punch\" tea to 5 guests at my dinner party. I did not tell them what it was or what was in it. My instructions for them were to simply react to the drink. What does it taste like? What does it remind you of?\n\nFor this tea I used The Republic of Tea Hibiscus (which also had some blackberry taste).\n\nHere are their reactions:\n\nCaroline: Mint aftertaste. Crisp, faintly sweet, refreshing. Not too heavy and not too watery.\n\nMeg: Happiness, tastes like Hi-C or Kool-Aid, and some mint. Smells fantastic, sweet.\n\nAllison: reminds me of Squeeze-Its!\n\nAdam: raspberry? tea, floral, great mint flavor, sweet\n\nErin: minty, fruity, refreshing, fruit punch-y\n\nMe: minty, herby, sweet, not overpowering, full flavor…and yes, it tastes just like fruit punch.\n\nOnce everyone wrote their reactions down, I asked them the (leading) question: did this taste like fruit punch?\n\nEveryone agreed in the affirmative immediately. Two of the taste testers already stated that it reminds them of drinks we used to drink in our childhood (those glorious, sugar-filled drinks of sweet \"fruit\").\n\nNow you know there is a drink out there that tastes like fruit punch yet has the highest antioxidant count out of every drink on this planet. Super healthy and tasty. And simple!\n\nThanks Dr. Gregor.\n\nBe sure to check out Dr. Gregor's blog at http://nutritionfacts.org/blog/"}
{"text": "One is black and has big brown eyes. The other is a blue-eyed blonde with the palest of skin.\n\nThey might share the same cheeky smile, but side by side, they could hardly look less alike.\n\nYet remarkably, Kian and Remee are twins, born a minute apart.\n\nLoving: Black and white twin sisters Kian (left) and Remee (right), seven years after they came into the world\n\nThe pair owe their appearance to a one in a million combination of their parents' genes.\n\nMother Kylee Hodgson and father Remi Horder both have white mothers and black fathers.\n\nThe startling result is a two-tone set of delightful little girls.\n\nThey first attracted international attention when they were featured in the Mail at less than a year old.\n\nNow, approaching their seventh birthday, they have never asked why they don't look the same, nor have they ever experienced any racial prejudice.\n\n'They are such a perfect example of how it should be,' their mother told the Mail. 'They are not bothered about their skin colour. It's not the big issue everyone else seems to see it as. It isn't important to them at all – it's about what they're like underneath.'\n\nKian and her 60-second older sister were delivered in April 2005 by caesarean section.\n\nSister act: The twins are in different classes at primary school, and have different interests\n\nKylee, now 25, recalls the moment she saw them for the first time: 'I noticed that both of them had beautiful blue eyes,' she said.\n\n'But while Remee's hair was blonde, Kian's was black and she had darker skin. To me, they were my kids and they were just normal. I thought they would start to look the same as time went on.'\n\nTime, however, only accentuated their differences. Kian's eyes changed colour and her skin got darker. Remee's complexion got lighter and her curly hair stayed blonde. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Kylee found herself fielding questions about whose children they were, or who Kian's fair-haired friend was, when she pushed them in their side-by-side buggy.\n\n'People would ask me why I dressed the children the same,' Kylee said. 'I'd just say: \"because they're twins,\" and leave people to work it out. It kind of irritated me at first, but everyone in my area got to know they were twins and accepted it. It was only strangers or outsiders who didn't know.'\n\nAlthough they share a common bond, the twins are already doing things their own way.\n\nHow the story was reported in 2006\n\nTheir appearance may be ebony and ivory, but in character they are chalk and cheese. They learned to walk and talk at different times, even though their first word – 'Juice!' – was identical.\n\nKian, according to her mother, 'is a bit bossier, a bit louder'. She added:\n\n'Remee is a bit more laid back. She'll think a bit longer before she does something.'\n\nMILLION TO ONE BABIES The odds of a mixed race couple having twins of different colours are a million to one. Skin colour is believed to be determined by up to seven different genes working together. If a parent is of mixed race, their eggs or sperm will contain a mixture of genetic codes for both black and white skin. However, if both the egg and sperm contain all white genes, the baby will be white. And if both contain just the versions necessary for black skin, the baby will be black.\n\nToday they are in different classes at school and have different sets of friends.\n\nThey both love dancing and sing along to the same records – mostly New York rapper Nicki Minaj and pop star Rihanna.\n\nBut their interests are different, Kian has a love of animals and her sister enjoys cookery.\n\nLike many twins though, they have an unspoken, almost intuitive affinity.\n\n'They get on so well,' said Kylee, now separated from Remi and living in Dudley, West Midlands.\n\n'They're really close,' she said. 'They're best friends – they absolutely love each other. They play together all the time, go swimming together, read their books together, help each other out.\n\n'If one can't do their shoes, the other will help.\n\n'Sometimes they do the same things at the same time. Once, they even sneezed together. That really made me laugh.\n\n'As they've got older, they've taught each other everything. They've helped each other to grow."}

{"text": "Digging around in online bibliographies and the references in the backs of yellowing texts on comparative religion, I came upon a 40-year-old treasure (to me, anyway): Judaism and the Gentile Faiths, by Joseph P. Schultz. This is the kind of book that helps me understand not just \"Comparative Religion\" but \"Religion\": the meaning of the search for meaning, and how cross-fertilized our traditions, our spirits, and our religious ideas may really be.\n\nThe author takes a look at Judaism with a comparative lens, and finds intriguing connections -- not only theological, but possibly historical -- between Judaism and Eastern traditions, most notably Hinduism, Buddhism and Confucianism.\n\nSome fun facts:\n\nThe flowering of classical traditions in Judaism and Confucianism happened contemporaneously -- in or around the 5th century BCE. Inscriptions on a synagogue built in Kaifeng in 1163 CE showed that Jews may have arrived there during the Han dynasty (as far back as 206 BCE).\n\nIn the first century CE, Rome ruled the entire Mediterranean basin. The ruling class developed a taste for the finer things, including silk, which helped develop the trade route between Europe and China. Jews may have migrated along this route, especially after the collapse of the Jewish State and the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE.\n\nArab geographers noted the presence of Jews in China during the Tang dynasty (618-907 CE). It was there, according to Schultz, not only with indigenous religions, but also \"along with Islam, Manichaeism, Zoroastrianism, and Nestorian Christianity.\"\n\nJudaism, and especially the Rabbinic tradition, includes some philosophical statements that are remarkably consistent with Eastern philosophy:\n\n\"Everything is in the hands of Heaven but the fear of Heaven\" (Berakhot 33b) is very consistent with Confucianism, both in thought and in terminology. The Confucian li (among other things, 'correct conduct') and Judaism's halakhah (law or way) have many striking similarities. Confucius: \"What you do not want done to yourself do not do to others.\" Hillel: \"What is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor.\"\n\nJewish contact with India may have cross-pollinated Vedanta with Kabbalah.\n\nThe articulation by Aaron of Starosselje (a disciple of R. Shneur Zalman of Liadi, founder of Chabad) of the diversity of the world from the human vantage point, and the unity of the world from the Divine, are very similar to the Vedanta philosophy of Maya (illusion), and especially the school of Ramanuja, who held, according to Schultz, that \"God can only be known through the medium of Scripture.\"\n\nJewish and Buddhist ideas of death and rebirth bear some similarities, too. This may go back beyond Vedanta, even to similarities in the biographies of Moses and the Buddha: born to or raised by royal families, they took radical steps to break free from their physical and theological confinements -- Moses by plunging into the world, the Buddha by retreating from it -- or the other way around, depending on how you look at it.\n\nOf course, there's this one gigantic difference: \"a central Buddhist thesis,\" says Schultz, is that \"what we have been in life will condition our life after death,\" whereas in rabbinic Judaism \"God's permanent and constant direction of human affairs is everywhere assumed.\" In other words, in Eastern traditions, reality as we know it does not presuppose our alienation from and attempts at reunion with an omniscient and personal Creator. But it does operate according to laws and dynamics that both Eastern and Western traditions recognize and adhere to.\n\nSo what, right?\n\nIn Judaism, history is part of the moment -- this moment, every moment. History is the unfolding of a redemption. Events are foretold in prophecy and in history, moving toward an ultimate in-gathering. In, say, Mahayana Buddhism, this moment is This Moment. Every moment simply is, and does not bear with it the lengthening, crushing train of historical precedent.\n\nSo . . . is morality grounded in history, and a reality established by God? Or is morality merely one strand of dharmakhaya -- the ultimate reality that underlies everything? Is history our struggle to return to proto-awareness, or to finally arrive at it? Did medieval Jewish philosophers, as Schultz says, \"purchase God's purity at the expense of His living reality\" . . . or did they preserve the essence of Judaism in a time of upheaval, assimilation and persecution?\n\nStay tuned.\n\n--T.A."}
{"text": "Music Theory: Keys, Scales and Triads\n\nThe table below summarises the basic ideas of music theory that relate to keys, key signatures, scales and triads. The key signature, major triad, minor triad and degrees of the scale are listed for all of the common major keys. Just find the key that you want to look up in the left hand column, then read across to find the triads, key signature etc.\n\nNote that some degrees of the scale (e.g 2nd & 9th) correspond to the same note. The difference is that one (in this case, the 2nd) will be a note within the first octave of the scale, and the other (the 9th) will be in the second octave of the scale.\n\nThanks to Laramie Sasseville for getting me started with this reference table.\n\nMajor Key Key Signature Major Triad Minor Triad 1st 2nd\n\n9th 3rd\n\n10th 4th\n\n11th 5th 6th\n\n13th 7th Octave C C E G C Eb G C D E F G A B C Db b b b b b Db F Ab Db Fb Ab Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C Db D # # D F# A D F A D E F# G A B C# D Eb b b b Eb G Bb Eb Gb Bb Eb F G Ab Bb C D Eb E # # # # E G# B E G B E F# G# A B C# D# E F b F A C F Ab C F G A Bb C D E F F# # # # # # # F# A# C# F# A C# F# G# A# B C# D# E# F# Gb b b b b b b Gb Bb Db Gb Bbb Db Gb Ab Bb Cb Db Eb F Gb G # G B D G Bb D G A B C D E F# G Ab b b b b Ab C Eb Ab Cb Eb Ab Bb C Db Eb F G Ab A # # # A C# E A C E A B C# D E F# G# A Bb b b Bb D F Bb Db F Bb C D Eb F G A Bb B # # # # # B D# F# B D F# B C# D# E F# G# A# B\n\nMinor keys\n\nTo find the notes of the scale for the minor key, look up the scale for the relative major key but start from the root of the minor scale (which will be the 6th of the major scale). In the above example, the scale of B minor is found by reading from the scale of the relative major (D major). Start on the 6th (B), then read across, looping back from the octave to the 2nd.. This gives us B C# D E F# G A as the B minor scale.\n\nEnharmonic equivalents\n\nAlso, it might seem a little odd to come across notes such as Fb, for example in a Db minor triad. Although you might be tempted to substitute E instead of Fb, as they are enharmonic equivalents, it is wrong to write a Db minor triad as Db E Ab - you must write the triad as Db Fb Ab.\n\nOther keys\n\nThe key signature of the \"unusual\" key will have seven more sharps or flats than the key with the same letter name. In our example, the key signature for G# major will have seven more sharps than G major. The table lists G major as having one sharp (F#) so G# major will have 8 sharps (F will be double sharp).\n\nThe idea of having double sharps or double flats is a little strange when you first come across it, but it's a well established idea in music theory and means you can use consistent rules for scales and keys.\n\nThe table below shows the relationships between the major and minor keys. To find the relative major or minor for another key just look up the corresponding entry in the table. For example, to find the relative minor of D major, find D in the major key column - this gives you B minor in minor key column so B minor is the relative minor of D major.\n\nRelative Major Key Relative Minor Key C A minor Db Bb minor D B minor Eb C minor E C# minor F D minor F# D# minor Gb Eb minor G E minor Ab F minor A F# minor Bb G minor B G# minor"}
{"text": "by\n\nTwo of the most important characters in Navaho mythology are twin miracle-performing sons of White-Shell Woman, Yólkai ?stsán, chief goddess. This plate pictures the leader of the two—the first conceived and the first-born, whose father is the sun. His name means \"Slayer of Alien Gods,\" from aná, alien; ye, gods; agán?, to kill. By him, with the assistance of Tobadz?schí?n?, his twin brother, were killed numerous bird, animal, rock, and human monsters, typifying evils, who wantonly destroyed human life.\n\nWhen the Spirit People came upon this earth from below they made six sacred mountains, four on the distant horizon at the cardinal points and two in the centre, Chó?li and Tz?lhnúhod?íhl?. On the eastern slope of Chó?li, brought forth as the daughter of Earth and Sky, was born Yólkai Estsán, White-Shell Woman. First Man took her to his home near Tz?lhnúhod?hl?, where she matured in twelve days into a beautiful woman with supernatural powers. Later she lived in a home of her own at the foot of this mountain. It was while there that she gave birth to twin boys who became saviours of their people, slaying alien gods who were fast depopulating the earth.\n\nYólkai Estsán would often lie on the eastern slope of the mountain as the sun rose through the morning, and when the day grew warm would seek the shade of jutting rocks from which trickled shining drops of water. Quite unknown to herself she had conceived one day from the sunbeams and the dripping water. When she became aware that she was to become a mother Yólkai ?stsán was made very happy, for she did not enjoy living alone. Soon she found herself the proud possessor of twin boys. The first-born and the stronger came to be known in his youth as Nayé?n?zgan?, Slayer of Alien Gods; the other was always known as Tobadz?schí?n?, Born From Water. Their prenatal life covered a period of only twelve days, and maturity was attained in thirty-two days after passing through eight changes, one of which came every four days.\n\nAt that time the earth was infested with great giants, foreign gods, who were rapidly destroying the people. Of these, Yé?tso, Big God, as large as a mountain, was the only one in human[pg 099] form. The others were Man-eating Bird, Rolling Stone, that crushed all in its path, Tracking Bear, and Antelope, who killed without mercy. Fearing lest some of these monsters learn of the presence of her boys, Yólkai ?stsán kept them hidden away on the mountain side, but they chafed under confinement, so she made them bows and arrows and let them play about, but admonished them not to stray far from home. The boys promised to obey, but not long afterward, because in reply to their questions their mother told them she did not know who their father was, they became sulky and broke their promise, going off toward the east. They would go and search for someone who knew. When on a small knoll a long way from home they heard a whispered \"Sh-h.\"\n\n\"Are you afraid, my younger brother?\" asked Nayé?n?zgan?.\n\n\"No!\" was the quick response.\n\nFour times they heard the whisper, and then two of the Wind People appeared. \"We saw you travelling eastward,\" said they, \"and came to caution you. The land is cursed with alien gods who kill for pleasure; beware of them! Why do you journey thus alone without your father?\"\n\n\"Our father! Alas, we know nothing of him and are now starting on a search to learn. Do you know who he is?\" asked the boys.\n\n\"Yes, the Sun is your father; but if you think to find him you will have to travel far eastward and cross the wide, wide waters.\"\n\nNayé?n?zgan? turned to his younger brother and said, \"Síts?l?, let us go.\"\n\nThe Sun was then overhead. Being in fact of a holy nature, the boys covered distance rapidly and by mid-afternoon had passed well beyond the limits of their homeland. There they[pg 100] came upon an old woman sitting beside a ladder projecting from a hole. She asked them who they were and whither they were going. They told her to the Sun, whose sons they were, but whom they had never seen."}

{"text": "As a newcomer walks up to Tucker's on South Broadway, another patron is on the way out, though his stay outside is limited to a sharp left turn and a quick whiz onto a nearby fence. Inside the tavern, it's neither bright nor dark but is relatively quiet, with maybe a dozen patrons fanned out around an L-shaped bar, heckling their afternoons and evenings away. No matter where you face, somewhere within your sightline is signage for Eddie Tucker, the place's eponymous owner and a candidate for a heavily contested, multi-candidate aldermanic race in south city's 11th ward.\n\nTucker was out sick on this evening, as he was a few weeks prior, when, on a weekday visit, almost the exact same number of customers were seated around the bar in roughly the same pattern. On that day, a commotion broke out around a strange smell wafting through the bar, stirred by a patron who blurted out, \"It smells like cappuccino in here!\"\n\nYou could drink in bars on South Broadway for 100 years and never hear one described as smelling of cappuccino, making this an amazing moment to eavesdrop. Turns out that a quiet guy with a mid-bar spot had just changed his vape flavor; a couple of hits on the vape pipe stirred the action. For a few minutes, conversation pepped up and became universal, everyone uniting in trying to identify the smell, then commenting on it, interrupting the previous discussion about how radio frequency IDs irrevocably changed the cross-country shipping business.\n\nTucker's is currently the southernmost bar along a 1.9-mile strip of urban life running through the neighborhoods of Carondelet and Patch, a stretch that includes eight bars of various stripes. On a given night, you can find indie troubadours, drag queens, bikers and neighborhood regulars mixed into these rooms.\n\nAnd while some outsiders might find eight bars in that short stretch a lot, old-timers figure that at least two-dozen were found along the same strip a couple of decades back. The shuttered one next door to Tucker's, most recently known as the Foundry, is a bar in search of an owner right now, a turnkey operation if ever there was one.\n\nBut South Broadway is not in decline. Quite the contrary. South Broadway feels, these days, like it's getting a new jolt of youthful energy. Two spots with roots on Cherokee, namely the Livery Company and the Sinkhole, opened on Broadway last year. And now neighborhood denizens are starting to think about the possibility of the area becoming a destination.\n\nAttorney Haden M. Smith grew up just across the River Des Peres and currently lives in the Carondelet neighborhood; his wife, attorney Sophie A. Smith Zavaglia, is currently president of the Carondelet Business Association. In short, they're invested.\n\nHaden Smith says that the bars on Broadway reflect the inherent quirks of the area. \"I've always been fascinated by the melting pot aspect of South Broadway,\" he explains. \"You have one of the oldest-running gay bars in the city alongside biker bars and soccer bars and live music venues, and even a bar with an obnoxious Trump sign thrown in. You have people who grew up in the neighborhood or very close by, transplanted Cherokee Street entrepreneurs, and also a ton of people from southern Missouri who migrated up 55. But the common thread is that nearly everyone who works or hangs out here today is very laid back and nonjudgmental. I've heard some ugly stories about past South Broadway bars\" — including, he says, a Cardinals backbencher \"getting the shit kicked out of him by racist rednecks\" in one bar in the 1980s. But, he adds, \"I think we do a pretty good job of getting along today. I'm proud of our lack of snobbishness and 'you're not from around here' exclusion.\"\n\nCurrently the Broadway strip is bereft of good restaurants and, in some parts, even residents. But to those who see its possibilities, those apparent detriments might provide room for opportunity — and the kind of prices that make an area appealing to those with a sense of adventure. The neighborhood, they say, has potential like never before.\n\n\"The best thing about the boom in development along Cherokee in the last fifteen years or so is that it has pulled the central corridor further south in the imaginations of a lot of people who previously wouldn't venture past Arsenal,\" Smith says. \"I think the next logical step is swinging further south and east to take advantage of not only the affordability but also the river views, the architecture and the 18th/early 19th century street grid in Carondelet.\""}
{"text": "Posted on: March 11th, 2017by Jason Hawken\n\nJohn Wick VR Review\n\nControl resolution is one of those things you didn't realize was interesting until somebody explained it. What it basically means is how many buttons you have to press to perform a certain action in a game. Most games have a low control resolution, you shoot a gun until it runs out of ammo, then you just press one button and you character ejects the old clip, grabs a new one, jams it in the gun and cocks it for you. Games like surgeon simulator have a very high control resolution, you control each finger and the angle, rotation and direction of your hand making the simple task of picking something up quite complicated, but realistic. Mostly this has been used as a funny little gimmick but in VR it's becoming a serious feature.\n\nIn John Wick's simulation mode you have to reload and cock your gun manually, reaching to you belt for more ammo each time. And it's awesome. Every time you slam in a new clip and pull back the hammer you feel a little more badass. You will want to spend ages in the training room just reloading until you are knee high in unspent ammunition. What makes this so much fun is how perfect all the animations are. From pulling back the bolt on a sniper rifle to tossing a grenade everything in John Wick has that cinematic feel to it.\n\nApart from the occasional last gen looking smoke effect the graphics are also quite impressive. I spent the\n\nfirst 5 minutes just playing with a gold coin I found in the hotel lobby, tossing it in the air and admiring the way the light reflected off it. When graphics approach photo realistic in VR like this you find yourself just wanting to hang around and smell the roses. But you didn't buy a game called John Wick just to see the inside of his penthouse, you want action. So how does it play as a game?\n\nWave shooters are a dime a dozen in VR and John Wick doesn't do a terrible lot to stand out from the crowd. You spend each level in one spot, ducking behind cover while goons duck behind their cover and throw the occasional grenade. You will be attacked from all angles and there are some cool scripted events but ammunition is unlimited and the aforementioned goons have no AI to speak of. This does not mean it is an easy game, in fact it's rather brutal, especially if you don't spend enough time in training to unlock better weapons (taking down a helicopter with a pistol is not recommended).\n\nEven on easy mode it's quite challenging, there's no slow-mo or bullet dodging like other wave shooters, survival requires fast reflexes. You will probably die a few times until you learn the attack patterns of each level. The shooting is entertaining enough that this rarely becomes frustrating but the heavily scripted enemies becomes a bit more obvious each time round. Most likely though this is a design choice to try and pad out the running time. With 3 levels that take about 10-15 minutes each it's not the shortest VR game around, but it's hardly full length. The training ground is fun though, and global leaderboards spice up the reruns a bit.\n\nThere is no real story and no particularly interesting set pieces, a parking lot, a rooftop, a yacht etc. While there is voice acting in the game, Keanu Reeves is sadly missing, you think they could have at least stolen a line or two from the film. There's a decent amount of detail in each area but once again, not that many areas. Most of the game feels really well made but the short running time and basic locations make the whole thing feel a little cheap. Luckily it is cheap, at only $20 it's a steal as far as VR games go and few VR games at this price have this level of quality. Well worth your money.\n\nHow to Make John Wich Work with Oculus Rift\n\nThe John Wick Chronicles Final Review Rating\n\nJohn Wick only officially supports the HTC Vive but with a simple tweak it can be made to run on Oculus Rift with Touch. Simply locate the game directory and set wick.exe to run in compatibility mode forWindows 7. This is how I played the game and it works excellently. Just make sure you have a decent amount of space and a 360 degree tracking setup, sections of the game require you to face directly behind and you will want to move around a bit to get in cover. Our beginners guide has some great tips for setting up the Oculus Rift for room scale.\n\nFinal Score – 6/10 – A gorgeous looking adrenaline rush of stylish gunplay that proves rather shallow if you scratch the surface, much like the action movie's on which it's based.\n\nThe good\n\nGood graphics\n\nCool realistic reloading\n\nWell Priced\n\nThe bad"}

He decided that, in the prime of his career, he would join his brother Hamza -- who also was playing in the NFL at the time -- to make a pilgrimage to Mecca.

He never got a shot to return to the NFL.\n\nHusain Abdullah said he didn't expect any repercussions from his penalty Monday night, least of all from his coach. After all, it was Reid who gave him an opportunity to work his way back into the league after he had stepped away.\n\n\"I'm pretty sure he understands who I am, what my faith is,\" he said. \"And again, I think the prostration is all right.

{"text": "[Physics FAQ] - [Copyright]\n\nUpdated 1997 by PEG.\n\nOriginal by Philip Gibbs 1997.\n\n\nI am driving my car at the speed of light and I turn on my headlights. What do I see?\n\nSadly this question and all others about experiences at the speed of light do not have a definitive answer. You cannot go at the speed of light so the question is hypothetical. Hypothetical questions do not have definitive answers. Only massless particles such as photons can go at the speed of light. As a massive object approaches the speed of light the amount of energy needed to accelerate it further increases so that an infinite amount would be needed to reach the speed of light.\n\nSometimes people persist: What would the world look like in the reference frame of a photon? What does a photon experience? Does space contract to two dimensions at the speed of light? Does time stop for a photon?. . . It is really not possible to make sense of such questions and any attempt to do so is bound to lead to paradoxes. There are no inertial reference frames in which the photon is at rest so it is hopeless to try to imagine what it would be like in one. Photons do not have experiences. There is no sense in saying that time stops when you go at the speed of light. This is not a failing of the theory of relativity. There are no inconsistencies revealed by these questions. They just don't make sense.\n\nDespite these empty answers, nobody should feel too put down for asking such questions. They are exactly the kind of question that Einstein often asked himself from the age of 16 until he discovered special relativity ten years later. Einstein reported that in 1896 he thought,\n\n``If I pursue a beam of light with the velocity c (velocity of light in a vacuum), I should observe such a beam of light as a spatially oscillatory electromagnetic field at rest. But there seems to be no such thing, whether on the basis of experience or according to Maxwell's equations. From the very beginning it appeared to me intuitively clear that, judged from the standpoint of such an observer, everything would have to happen according to the same laws as for an observer who, relative to the earth, was at rest. For how, otherwise, should the first observer know, i.e., be able to determine, that he is in a state of fast uniform motion? One sees that in this paradox the germ of the special relativity theory is already contained. Today everyone knows, of course, that all attempts to clarify this paradox satisfactorily were condemned to failure as long as the axiom of the absolute character of time, viz., of a simultaneous, unrecognizedly was anchored in the unconscious. Clearly to recognize this axiom and its arbitrary character really implies already the solution to the problem.''\n\nIn 1905 he realised how it could be that light always goes at the same speed no matter how fast you go. Events that are simultaneous in one reference frame will happen at different times in another that has a velocity relative to the first. Space and time cannot be taken as absolute. On this basis Einstein constructed the theory of special relativity, which has since been well confirmed by experiment.\n\nQuestions of relative velocity in relativity can be answered using the velocity subtraction formula v = (w − u)/(1 − wu/c2) (see relativity FAQ: velocity addition). If you are driving at a speed u relative to me and you measure the speed of light in the same direction (w = c in my frame), the formula gives v the speed of light in your reference frame as, v = (c − u)/(1 − u/c). For any speed u less than c this gives v = c so the speed of light is the same for you. But if u = c the formula degenerates to zero divided by zero; a meaningless answer.\n\nIf you want to know what happens when you are driving at very nearly the speed of light, an answer can be given. Within your car you observe no unusual effects. You can look at yourself in your mirror which is moving with the car and you will look the same as usual. Looking out of the window is a different matter. The light from your headlights will always go at the speed of light in your reference frame. It will strike any object in its path and be reflected back. Everything else will be coming towards you at nearly the speed of light, so the light reflected from it will be Doppler shifted to very high frequencies—towards the ultraviolet or beyond. If you have a suitable camera you could take a snapshot. The objects passing are contracted in length but because of the different times of passage for the light and effects of aberration, the snapshot will show the objects you pass as rotated.

{"text": "The Maldives Takes Its Place in Indian Ocean Geopolitics\n\nIn April, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hosted Maldivian President Abdulla Yameen in New Delhi, where they inked six agreements, including one on defense cooperation. A year earlier, Modi had cancelled a Maldives visit amid political chaos there. But India has reinitiated engagement with the archipelago, prompted by its new China-oriented trajectory. This demonstrates that small nations like the Maldives are in a position to benefit from India-China competition.\n\nIndia's new Maldives approach comes at a time in which maritime trade is becoming increasingly important for both India and China. China almost doubled its reliance upon imports to satisfy its oil needs between 2000 and 2014, while India's dependence on oil imports jumped from 43 percent to 71 percent between 1990 and 2012. A substantial proportion of these imports travel along Indian Ocean trade routes. In addition, nearly one third of Chinese maritime commerce and the bulk of Indian trade involves Indian Ocean shipping.\n\nChina's strategic interests and logistical limitations in the Indian Ocean have prompted the country to increase its presence in the region. For example, the country has begun using anti-piracy missions to expand regular naval activity. China is also reaching out to the Indian Ocean region through the \"One Belt, One Road\" project, which is premised on the idea of common development.\n\nChina's efforts in the Indian Ocean have at times sparked tension with India. A 2014 Chinese submarine visits to Sri Lanka and other spots in the Indian Ocean infuriated New Delhi, while the Indian press received with skepticism China's Djibouti outpost, the first Chinese naval facility on foreign soil. In order to respond to heightened Chinese involvement in the region, India has initiated a proactive naval posture.\n\nBoth China and India rely on safe trade routes crossing the Indian Ocean, so both countries aim to boost their clout in the area. The Maldives plays a key role in this geopolitical competition. The archipelago is adjacent to the main regional shipping routes, making it an important Indian Ocean toehold.\n\nChina has sought to enhance its relationship with the Maldives through cooperation on infrastructure development and tourism. During Xi Jinping's 2014 visit, the two countries discussed prospective projects such as the \"China-Maldives Friendship Bridge,\" a $210 million initiative, funded chiefly by Beijing. In 2014, 360,000 Chinese tourists traveled to the Maldives, constituting more than 30 percent of all visitors to the country.\n\nIndia's engagement with the Maldives features collaboration in various fields, including healthcare, military affairs, and infrastructure. Indian aid to the Maldives surged from $4 million in 2014 to $30 million in 2015 and 2016. This cooperation may further improve under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's \"Neighborhood First\" policy, which prioritizes close ties to proximate countries.\n\nPolitical instability in the Maldives has limited India's effort to engage the country. When Maldivian President Abdulla Yameen initiated a crackdown on his political adversaries in February 2015 and imprisoned pro-India former President Mohamed Nasheed, a worried Modi called off his March 2015 trip to the archipelago.\n\nDespite these limitation, the Maldives' strategic location has encouraged India to continue its efforts to engage. In July 2015, the Maldives amended its constitution to allow foreign ownership of land, sparking Indian fears that China would try to develop \"strategic assets\" in the archipelago. Both China and the Maldives denied this, but the constitutional change nonetheless prompted India to revisit its relationship to the country. Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj took a trip to the Maldives just after the amendment came into force.\n\nIndia remains cautious, however, about trying to play a role in sorting out the political chaos in the Maldives. The growing Chinese presence in the Indian Ocean enables the Maldives to capitalize on the \"China card\" to limit India's options by raising the possibility that Indian withdrawal or criticism will encourage the archipelago to tilt towards China. Additionally, while Modi's \"Neighborhood First\" policy and Indian Ocean tour suggest that the security and common economic development of the region are high priorities for India, Maldivian President Yameen has made clear his view that foreign powers should keep out of the archipelago's internal politics. Engaging in a dispute with the Maldives over domestic issues would have severely degraded the prospects of Modi's fledgling Indian Ocean diplomacy.\n\nFor its part, the Maldives benefits from its ability to balance between China and India, turning their geopolitical competition into engagement and aid. By moving closer to China, Yameen impelled India to overcome its grievances tied to Maldivian domestic politics, demonstrating the country's ability to use geopolitical competition in the Indian Ocean to its advantage.\n\nMohd Zakir/Hindustan Times via Getty Images"}
{"text": "2) Budget a LOT of time. I'm sure experienced swatchers can do this more quickly, but it took me roughly 30 - 45 minutes per colour to do the full swatching/clean up/picture editing/posting on the blog. For the 11 colours I did, I spent about 4 hours on polish, and 2 - 3 hours on photo editing and posting. That's a LOT of work!\n3) Sunlight is mandatory for great colour! Unless you have a professional photo studio, which I do not. I use a simple point and shoot camera, some white paper to provide a clean background, and the sun.\n4) Keep an eye on the weather forecast! Living in the north, I'm at a serious disadvantage in winter when it comes to the window I have for swatching. At this time of year, I have a few hours of good strong sunlight that will let me take nice pictures, so I took advantage of every minute. Once summer rolls around, I'm sure the advantage will skew in my favour - I look forward to it!\n5) Keep a glass of water nearby. Between the polish fumes and acetone fumes, your throat will get scratchy and dry. This leads directly to...\n6) Work in a well-ventilated area to reduce exposure to noxious fumes. Acetone is NOT a fun thing to breathe in!\n7) Do the colours you're working with really need a base coat? If it doesn't stain, then don't waste your time. And don't assume that dark colours will stain while light colours won't - ManGlaze's Fuck off and Dye is a hot pink that will stain your nailbeds as soon as you put it on, while the Deborah Lippmann Edge of Glory black creme I had on today didn't stain at all with no base coat through several applications. Test and be sure!\n8)  Be expedient. I've yet to take a single picture that shows my thumb or my right hand, so now I just polish the four fingers on my left hand. This saves a lot of time and clean up!\n9) Rushing your polish job will just end in misery later when you try and fix your mistakes in Photoshop. \n10) On the topic of Photoshop, learn what's an easy post-processing fix, and what's just an invitation to torture. Ding your creme polish a bit? Not a big deal - that can be quickly and easily fixed in Photoshop. Got polish along your cuticle? You're gonna pull your hair out trying to fix it.\n11) A small cosmetic brush and a bottle of pure acetone are your best friends for cleaning up your manicure. Take your time and gently brush away any mistakes along your cuticle, edges, and sides of your fingers. The pure acetone will just eat away the polish, so be careful! \n12) Every second you spend cleaning up your nails before you take a picture means minutes saved afterwards.\n13) Even if you don't see the mess on your nails, your camera will. A high resolution macro shot in sunlight is extremely unforgiving - every speck of stray polish, every bit of dry skin, every stray piece of pet fur will show up.\n14) Just because you can't see it, doesn't mean it's not there. Even if you can't see a mess on your cuticles, run the brush over them anyway because the camera will.\n15) Think you're in the safe from camera mistakes with your base and top coat because they're clear? Think again. The macro setting and the sun will reveal any clear polish on your cuticles or fingers, making them look uneven and messy. Make sure to swipe the brush along your cuticles after your topcoat too!\n16) When you finish cleaning up your cuticles with the brush, take a cotton pad and wipe down your fingertip and around your nail. This will clean up any polish that dripped with the acetone down your skin and collected in any lines on your fingers. Trust me, it's there. You'll be amazed what comes off on that cotton pad!\n17) After all that acetone, your nails and fingers are going to be super dry. Give them a good slather of cuticle oil afterwards to help smooth things over.\n18) After your nails are nicely cleaned up, take your pictures against a clean white background. Plain old printer paper will work fine for this.\n19) Take a LOT of pictures from a ton of angles! You never know what you're going to capture by moving the camera a bit. You can sort out the good from the bad when you're in Photoshop\nThat's it for now! I'm sure I'll have more to share as I continue learning how to swatch and photograph my manicures :)"}
{"text": "It's been ten years since the characters of Marvel's comics and Capcom's video games faced off in a fighting title, so 2011's Marvel Vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds can't come soon enough.\n\nThe title, which will likely feature more than 30 characters to choose from and feature 3-on-3 tag team fighting, hits the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 in spring 2011. There currently are no plans for an arcade, computer or Wii version of the title, Capcom tells Kotaku.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I'm really excited to be here so that I can share this information with you today,\" Ryota Niitsuma, the game's producer, told a room of journalists gathered last week in Hawaii for the game's unveiling.\n\nLike Capcom's popular Street Fighter IV, Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 will feature 3D characters fighting on a 2D plane, he said. The game won't, however, use the same sort of graphics found in Street Fighter IV and Super Street Fighter IV. Instead Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 will run on an \"advanced version\" of MT Framework, the same engine that powers the graphics of Lost Planet 2 and Resident Evil 5.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Each version of MT Framework gets better than the previous version,\" Niitsuma said. \"A lot of key staff are involved with this game and they wanted to use the engine they are more comfortable with.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris Baker, the manager of licensed games at Marvel Studios, said he was astounded to see the concept art for Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 and said that in action it's just as amazing, calling the title a \"beautiful, beautiful game.\"\n\nBaker pointed out that Wolverine's look in the game hearkens back to the classic look of the beloved character. Iron Man, on the other hand, fits his contemporary look and The Hulk has a new visual style.\n\nThe shaders used on each character, Capcom's Seth Killian said, are what really make all of the characters so visually distinct in motion. Even Capcom's Ryu, he pointed out, is brought out in a new way with the help of the shaders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"You could see him sitting in a comic book frame,\" Killian said, \"and maybe one day you will.\"\n\nThe game will also have an eclectic and robust mix of music, with at least 100 pieces including remixes of favorites from previous Marvel Vs. Capcom games as well as some new music.\n\n\"It's all about having a lot of content and things to go with this game,\" Niitsuma said. \"We also want to make sure the music suits the type of game this is.\"\n\nAnd the music needs to suit the characters as well, Baker added.\n\nWhile news of a new version of Marvel Vs. Capcom was highly anticipated leading up to Capcom's annual event last week (Baker said it was one of the questions most often asked of him and the hardest secret he's had to keep since working at the comic company), the presentation was light on details about which characters would make the cut for the game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nshows that Wolverine, the Hulk, Iron Man, Street Fighter's Ryu, Darkstalker's Morrigan and Resident Evil's Chris Redfield will be in the game. It also The gameplay-free trailer shows that Wolverine, the Hulk, Iron Man, Street Fighter's Ryu, Darkstalker's Morrigan and Resident Evil's Chris Redfield will be in the game. It also hints at the appearance of Captain America, Super Skrull, Chun-Li, Deadpool, Felicia, Dante or Nero, Spencer or Wesker, Mephisto, Rad Spencer and Doctor Doom. The inclusion of Redfield in the game is indicative of the direction the game's developers are headed in terms of Capcom character selection, Killian said.\n\nWhile the game could certainly support any number of characters, Niitsuma said that time constraints led the team to shoot for a bit more than 30 characters in the game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile downloadable content for the game, most likely new characters, is certainly possible, no DLC plans have yet been locked in, said Capcom's Seth Killian.\n\n\"There are a couple of different directions they're thinking about,\" he said.\n\nAnd unlike previous Marvel Vs. Capcom games, this latest iteration will have a strong storyline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's important that game's have strong stories for Marvel,\" Baker said. \"With fighting games it's not as essential as an action game or role playing game but we are very much insisting there be some cohesive kind of story for this game.\n\n\"We actually have a subtitle for the game that means something this time. In the coming months we will be giving you more information about it.\""}
{"text": "When Sirkka-Liisa Konttinen moved to Byker, an English neighborhood in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, she was drawn to the laughter, the children playing in the streets, the energy. For her, this blue-collar community brimmed with life.\n\nThen it was demolished.\n\nThe neighborhood's younger population moved elsewhere for work; many of its older residents, with nowhere else to go, simply gave up.\n\nMs. Konttinen moved on, too. She took on other projects in northeast England, photographing the beaches, Newcastle's Quayside, and a dancing school in North Shields. She returned to her native Finland for a year, photographing Scandinavian forests. Byker, it seemed, was tucked away in her past.\n\nByker Then & Now Sirkka-Liisa Konttinen On Thursday, we presented images from Sirkka-Liisa Konttinen's original series on the Byker neighborhood in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Read more »\n\nBut she had left a set of her original Byker pictures — a semipermanent loan — at a community center there. \"Five years later, I couldn't quite remember anymore where I had left it, so I thought I better go and retrace my steps,\" Ms. Konttinen said.\n\nIn the intervening decades, things had changed. New immigrants, many of them asylum seekers, had settled in Byker. It was a bit of a shock — while many cities in England were experiencing waves of immigration from all over the world for years, Byker had not. Nevertheless, Ms. Konttinen was struck to learn that her photos were helping new residents connect with the old neighborhood that she had first photographed in the late 1960s.\n\n\"They actually used my work as the bridge for them to understand where they had come to and what the history of the place had been,\" she said.\n\nCurious, she attended a few local functions — capoeira, tai chi, volunteering at an asylum seekers' support group — and was surprised that today's residents had an enthusiasm for the place that was reminiscent of her own, 40 years ago. Struck by their excitement, she returned with her camera.\n\nThe newer photos — a rare instance of color in Ms. Konttinen's oeuvre — reflect a more diverse community of immigrants and young families in their tidy, colorful homes. \"Byker Revisited\" is quirkier, but Ms. Konttinen's approach has evolved.\n\nShe found that people's attitudes toward photography had changed — a stranger walking with a camera is a bit more suspicious these days than in the '60s, especially around children. In the old days, when the community was small and — Ms. Konttinen admitted — at times a bit nosy, it wasn't long before she was well known in the neighborhood. But in the new Byker, Ms. Konttinen had to invest a year joining community groups and listening and collecting stories, before introductions turned into invitations into homes.\n\n\"The key, I think, has been that people get to know me as much as I get to know them, so there is a relationship,\" she said.\n\nAs a result, she was more collaborative in this series, giving her subjects a say in how they presented themselves. She asked them: \"If you have just one picture to describe yourself to the rest of the world, what would you have in it?\" She warned her subjects that even if she took hundreds of pictures, she would only use one to tell each resident's story. She'd set up her lights — sometimes tricky in tight spaces — encourage them to put on their best dress if they wanted to, and wait with her flash for the right moment.\n\nHow she used the light was also a way to obscure the acute consciousness of class that characterizes British social anxieties. (Ms. Konttinen, being a hard-to-place foreigner, was not plagued by such anxieties.) \"Often, if you go with the natural light and the fairly casual approach, you tend not to come away with stately portraiture, which is always afforded to the middle classes and the upper classes,\" she said. \"I thought it would be rather nice to offer something of a similar approach to the people in the humbler circumstances.\"\n\nSirkka-Liisa Konttinen/Amber Collective\n\nPhotographs from Ms. Konttinen's original \"Byker\" series will be on view at the L. Parker Stephenson Gallery from Feb. 15 to May 11. Ms. Konttinen will also deliver a lecture at the International Center for Photography on Feb. 13.\n\nFollow Lens on Facebook and Twitter."}

{"text": "Multnomah superintendent ousted, banned from building\n\nEducation Service District board hopes to replace Barbara Jorgensen by June 1\n\nMultnomah County Education Service District's board is no longer allowing Superintendent Barbara Jorgensen in the building while it searches for her replacement.\n\nThe move came with an official vote Tuesday night, March 17, but the factors behind it have been brewing since last summer, say board members.\n\nBernie Giusto, former Multnomah County Sheriff and Multnomah ESD board chairman, says Jorgensen's ouster was a result of \"leadership style, or lack there of.\"\n\nThe dissatisfaction with Jorgensen's leadership stemmed from the superintendents of the county's eight school districts: Portland, Centennial, Parkrose, David Douglas, Reynolds, Riverdale, Gresham-Barlow, and Corbett. The school districts provide about 90 percent of the budget for the ESD, Giusto says, and the superintendents had threatened to pull their contracts from the umbrella organization if Jorgensen were not removed.\n\nGiusto says the decision was based on the unhappiness from the superintendents, who requested a meeting with the board three weeks ago at the Parkrose School District office.\n\n\"At that point we realized we needed to make a change,\" Giusto says. \"It was in the interest of everybody to transistion the leadership of ESD.\"\n\nThat led to a cryptic March 5 press release stating that Jorgensen would henceforth be working from home.\n\n\"MESD today confirmed that Superintendent Barbara Jorgensen is currently working offsite, and will continue to work offsite for the indeterminate future. Out of respect for Superintendent Jorgensen's privacy, MESD is refraining from comment about this change,\" read the release.\n\nOn March 17, Jim Rose, Multnomah ESD's Chief Operating Officer and Director of Technology, was announced as interim superintendent. Rose has said he would not want to continue on as superintendent, according to a news release.\n\nJorgensen was promoted to superintendent in 2012 after former Superintendent Ron Hitchcock left suddenly, Giusto says. As Chief Program Officer, Jorgensen had been second-in-command.\n\n\"She was chosen for the job based on what we needed in the moment,\" Guisto says.\n\nESD board Vice Chair Nels Johnson says the decision to make a change wasn't personal.\n\n\"For the record, I think Barbara is a wonderful person and a wonderful ESD leader,\" Johnson says. But, he adds, the consensus among superintendents that she needed to go, \"we have to take very seriously.\"\n\n'Rough time for the agency'\n\nJohnson adds that the Multnomah ESD has had a rough year. Indeed, the embattled agency had an extended bargaining contract process that finished up in February; Multnomah ESD special educator Brett Bigham, Oregon's 2014 Teacher of the Year, has lodged multiple complaints against the agency and Jorgensen over what he says is bias against his sexual orientation; and the alternative Alpha High School in Gresham is slated to be shut down at the end of the year due to low enrollment.\n\nA spokeswoman for the district says none of these issues directly related to Jorgensen's departure.\n\n\"This is obviously a pretty tough time for the agency,\" Johnson, the board vice-chair, says, noting that the new superintendent will have a \"real opportunity to correct the course and turn this ship around.\"\n\nJohnson said the superintendent search would stay within the state because the district will need someone with experience with Oregon's \"wacky\" revenue system for schools. He says the hiring committee will \"emphasize the ability to work collaboratively\" in the search for its new superintendent.\n\nGiusto says his \"priorities are energetic leadership, and aptitude for leadership and building confidence in the people we are supposed to lead.\"\n\nJorgensen did not respond to requests for comment. A visit to the location of her Angel's Attic shop in Fairview showed an empty storefront in disarray. It is unclear if she still owns the shop.\n\nJorgensen has had a 30-year career in education, including 13 years as Multnomah ESD Special Education Director from 1994 to 2007.\n\nUnder the separation agreement, which has not yet been finalized, she will work from home for the next three months. Her salary is $147,420.\n\nEducation service districts allow school districts to team up to provide services such as early intervention, special education, nursing staff and technology.\n\nPamplin Media Group reporter Teresa Carson contributed to this report.\n\n\nBy Shasta Kearns Moore\n\nReporter"}
{"text": "Flacco, though, is the kind of player for whom the franchise tag was designed.\n\n\"To me, the franchise tag should be used on a player that your team is not just going to be worse without, but is going to be fall-off-a-cliff worse without,\" the agent David Canter said.\n\nThe problem, in the eyes of Canter and many players, is that the franchise tag — which teams can use on one player a year — has more recently evolved into a mechanism to reduce the movement even of players without whom teams would certainly not plummet.\n\nThat was never more apparent than last year, when 21 of the 32 teams used the tag, often on players who fell well short of the franchise quarterback standard. The reason: in the final hurried days of negotiations toward a new collective bargaining agreement nearly two years ago, the convoluted formula for determining the amount of money paid to players given the tag was changed. Not surprisingly, in a deal that has so far tilted to the advantage of teams in almost every financial way, the adjustment made the tag less onerous for teams and even less appealing for players.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe tag numbers used to be calculated by taking the average of the top five salaries at a given position in the previous season. The tagged player would play for that amount for one year.\n\nNow, the tag number is determined by a mind-numbing formula that takes into account salaries over five years and their percentage of the overall cap in those years. As a result, the franchise numbers have dipped.\n\nWhile the figures for next season have not been set, the salary for a franchised quarterback is expected to be around $14.6 million. It was $16.1 million in 2011, a number that was elevated because the previous season had been an uncapped year.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

A significant injury during the franchise year would send a player into free agency with a likelihood of diminished earnings, rather than a chance at the lucrative contract he might have received if he had been allowed to test the market the previous year.\n\n\"I'm very, very disappointed that the numbers have gone down,\" Canter said. \"I'm disappointed it's become a much easier device for teams to wield against players. It's a scare tactic and a power tactic by the team. 'If you don't agree to our lousy deal, we'll slap the tag on you, and you know you're risking injury.' You've earned your right to test the market. It's creating an animosity and a wall that happens so often with the franchise tag.\"\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nComplicating decisions about the tag this year is that the salary cap is again expected to rise only slightly, to about $123 million, forcing many teams to cut still-viable veterans whose salary figures have risen. There will most likely be some hesitation to use the tag on any but the most indispensable players.\n\nSome agents said during the combine that they feared a class system would result from the flat cap: that the elite 15 percent of N.F.L. players would receive top dollar and the rest of the league, forming the backbone of rosters, would be disappointed by the deals offered in free agency, with a market flush with talented players looking for jobs.\n\nFlacco does not need to worry about that, of course. If Linta and the Ravens are unable to strike a deal, the Ravens will put the tag on Flacco. If it is not the exclusive tag — which pays more but would mean he could not negotiate with other teams — Baltimore will run the risk of another team's trying to construct a deal that it cannot match.\n\nLinta, who represents his share of nonmarquee players in addition to a star like Flacco, has a unique view of the franchise tag. The lower franchise numbers under the new formula leave more salary-cap space for the rest of the roster.\n\n\"The rank and file, they don't care,\" Linta said. \"I'm perfectly fine with the way it is. It only affects in a normal year three to six guys a year. What benefited the middle and lower class negatively affected the upper class.\""}

There were several lead changes, but we got some defensive stops.\"\n\nThose stops came in the second half as Winslow broke a 23-all stalemate at the half and outscored the Scouts 27 to 15.\n\nThe first defensive stop came right after the break as the Bulldogs held Window Rock in check for the first seven minutes of the third quarter.\n\nThen in a four-minute span in the next quarter, Winslow put up another roadblock and erased a 32-31 deficit and turned it into a 45-34 lead with two minutes to go.\n\n\"I thought we played three good quarters according to our game plan,\" Window Rock head coach Charles Chong said. \"I thought Arianne (Sheka) and Aspen (Sheperd) did a great job tonight. They plugged that middle up so that Winslow couldn't get their inside game going.\n\n\"They had some nice blocks, but the thing about playing Winslow is – you can't go on a pause,\" Chong added. \"When you hit that pause button because you're going to swallow 10 points and that was exactly what happened.\"\n\nChong said they were very fortunate to get back into the game after that first pause, but when the second one happened \"it stuck.\"\n\n\"Winslow is an excellent team and they are very discipline,\" he said. \"In the first half we disrupted some things they wanted to do, but I told the girls this is going to come down to playing four good quarters.\n\n\"You just can't let up, especially against a team like Winslow,\" he added.\n\nDuring those stops, senior guard Mattea Begay hit three treys, including the dagger with 2:11 to go that earned the Bulldogs a 45-34 lead.\n\n\"Our offense pretty much comes from our defense,\" Begaii said. \"We just had to close them out on defense.\"\n\nOn the offensive end, Begaii said they made Window Rock work by swinging the ball around the perimeter until they found an open look.\n\nThe Bulldogs also got big contributions from junior guard Marcella Joe and sophomore post Shandiin Armao as they combined for 25 points with Joe scoring 13.\n\n\"This was a really big game,\" Joe said. \"We knew coming in here we had to stay humble. We were nervous, but we knew we had to get the job done.\"\n\nSome of those early nerves showed in the first half in the form of fouls.\n\nThe Bulldogs were forced to go into their bench with Joe and Halle Hayes saddled with three fouls each.\n\n\"I like to compliment Tannon Tom and Kaelyn Bitsoi for stepping up,\" Jordan said of his two players off the bench. \"They did a real good job, but my veterans did a good job of carrying the load.\"\n\nWindow Rock was also bothered with fouls as Sheka sat on the bench for most of the third quarter. During that time it seemed the Scouts were out of sync.\n\n\"Our subs are not used to this atmosphere, so they were a little hesitant,\" Chong said. \"And you know when we held our breath things got out of hand and Winslow made us pay. They took that lead and we we're chasing them after that.\"\n\nChong said it was nice to see Winslow at this time of the season since this served as test for what's to come.\n\n\"This was a good barometer for us,\" he said. \"It kind of shows us what our competition is going to be like.\"\n\nThe Scouts were led by Naomi Klah as the junior guard finished with 13 points, which included three treys.\n\nSheperd and Sheka both finished with 8 points apiece.\n\nBack to top ^"}
