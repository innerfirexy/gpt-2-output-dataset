{"text": "Last weekend, the 2017 Bathurst 1000 was held at its traditional gauntlet in Bathurst, New South Wales, on the Mount Panorama Circuit. Narrow, fast, and with more elevation change than some entire countries, Mount Panorama is among the trickiest of tracks in the world to get just right, as the faster you go, the closer you find yourself to the looming concrete walls, especially at the top of the mountain. The prestige of mastering the mountain is enough to give every driver who races on it the courage to grab their car by the scruff of the neck in the hopes of landing themselves on pole.\n\nIn the race's qualifying shootout, a high-stakes one lap affair in which the race's top ten qualifiers compete to secure the highest grid position possible, Scott McLaughlin of DJR Team Penske, driving his Ford FG X Falcon, took pole position with a lap that mirrors the infamous \"Lap of the Gods\" set by Greg Murphy in 2003."}

{"text": "To the Editor:\n\nWilliam Safire's entertaining ''Auguring Well'' (Jan. 21) referred to the option the President has to ''swear'' or ''affirm'' his intention to execute the duties of office. Mr. Safire mistakenly noted, ''Of the 40 men who have taken that oath, only Herbert Hoover chose 'affirm.' ''\n\nFranklin Pierce, our 14th President, chose to ''affirm'' rather than to ''swear.''\n\nHe did this as a result of the death of his 11-year-old son, Benjamin, killed in a train accident about two months before Pierce took the oath. Pierce believed the death of his son was a punishment for his sins, so he did not employ the Bible during the inauguration. This action necessitated substituting ''affirm'' for ''swear.''\n\nTHOMAS VINCIGUERRA\n\nGarden City, L.I., Jan. 22, 1985"}

{"text": "We study the angular momentum of phonons in a magnetic crystal. In the presence of a spin-phonon interaction, we obtain a nonzero angular momentum of phonons, which is an odd function of magnetization. At zero temperature, a phonon has a zero-point angular momentum in addition to a zero-point energy. With increasing temperature, the total phonon angular momentum diminishes and approaches zero in the classical limit. The nonzero phonon angular momentum can have a significant impact on the Einstein–de Haas effect. To obtain the change of angular momentum of electrons, the change of the phonon angular momentum needs to be subtracted from the opposite change of the lattice angular momentum. Furthermore, the finding of the phonon angular momentum gives a potential method to study the spin-phonon interaction. Possible experiments on phonon angular momentum are also discussed.\n\nDOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.085503"}

The company is shooting to have this service launched by the end of the year, although it isn't yet clear if Intel will be able to meet that goal — The Wall Street Journal's source indicated that no content deals had been struck yet. Between this potential new service, the ever-present Apple TV set rumors, and proposed online TV network Ora.tv trying to lure Larry King out of retirement, it looks like internet-based TV could start really start putting pressure on cable providers."}

Bungie's Lead Graphics Architect Hao Chen discusses how Umbra's solution enabled a new level of artistic freedom and rapid content iteration times. Umbra's solution eliminates the need for manual markups typically associated with polygon soups. It allows loose construction of game worlds instead of highly restrictive and technical process of constructing well formed, water-tight geometry. The automatically created spatial database can be used for reasoning about space, not only to perform occlusion culling but also to solve other problems such as 3D path finding, audio propagation and even lighting. This approach is vital in the creation of Bungie's next universe and its unparalleled gaming experience, which is why Umbra 3 is a key component in Destiny.

Sure, it may not be the most expensive, quickest and rarest car, but until you have driven one there is no way you can understand how these cars feel and perform.\n\nThis page was created out of the passion I have for my car, a trait shared among all RX-7 owners. I hope you find it useful.\n\nBack To Home Page | Mail Me | Search"}
{"text": "Montenegro: 60% consider homosexuality an illness, survey\n\n(ANSAmed) - PODGORICA, FEBRUARY 21 - Sixty percent of Montenegrins consider homosexuality an illness, according to a survey carried out recently in the small Balkan country. In the survey, conducted by the Centre for Civic Education (CGO) and the gay movement Progres in collaboration with the Canadian embassy in Podgorica, 52% say they support the right of homosexuals to publicly declare their sexual orientation, compared with 45% who are against it. Another 25% say they believe that homosexuals are a group of people at risk and who should be helped to achieve their rights, a statement rejected by 40% of the respondents. Even neighbouring Serbia homosexual are looked on with suspicion and oftentimes with open hostility. Last October's Gay Pride event scheduled to take place in Belgrade was called off at the last moment due to serious threats from a group of homophobic extremists and ultra-nationalists, who had threatened to carry out acts of violence and cause incidents.

Their findings were published last month in the American Journal of Physiology, Heart and Circulatory Physiology.\n\nAccording to the study authors, the small blood vessels in the brains of sheep closely resemble those in the human brain. Using imaging techniques, they were able to track blood flow in the brain before and after administration of the vasodilator Serelaxin. Their results showed an impressive 150% increase in blood flow to the cortical brain areas within 15 minutes of administering the drug. The cortex of the brain is the outer gray layer important in our perceptions (vision, taste, hearing, sensations, understanding language, etc – see image below).

Doesn't feel natural in a few spots.\n\nThe good news is that Zack Snyder shows his strengths, with great action and visual effects. There's so many beautiful sequences here, and the CGI is on point.\n\nSurprisingly, characters all get a substantial arc. Cyborg is good, The Flash is a bit much at times. Batman and Wonder Woman stand out, Superman also feels refreshed and this is almost a rebirth of the character.

And the firm-yet-compliant suspension teams with a balanced and frisky chassis and Miata-like steering. Our glowing real-world handling judgments weren't dampened much by the car's midpack 0.82-g skidpad performance or so-so 179-foot stopping distance from 70 mph. We tested the 3 at a different venue than usual, and its surface felt noticeably slicker than that on our home turf. Acceleration is fairly zippy, with 60 mph arriving in 7.2 seconds, and the automatic's manual shift mode—operable via the shift lever or steering-wheel paddles—is quick to respond. Sport mode further sharpens the powertrain, and even when left to shift on its own, the transmission always seems to find the right gear. Despite spending most of its time in our hands being hammered down back roads, the 3 returned a respectable 26 mpg—2 mpg shy of its EPA city fuel-economy estimate."}

{"text": "DETROIT — After a prolonged recovery that culminated in two years of record sales, the American auto industry is slowing down, with fewer buyers in dealer showrooms and fewer workers on the factory floor.\n\nAutomakers said this week that sales dropped in June for a sixth consecutive month, falling by 3 percent from a year ago, a trend that analysts do not see letting up anytime soon. And as demand falls, there is less work in the nation's auto-assembly plants — primarily those that build traditional passenger cars.\n\nLast year, those plants hit a peak of 211,000 workers, a 55 percent increase since the depths of the recession in 2009. That figure has dropped by more than 2 percent so far this year, to 206,000 workers in April, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and could shrink further as sales continue to fall.\n\n\"There's been a consistent reduction in plant output in the last six months, and what is ahead in the next six months could be pretty startling,\" said Ron Harbour, an auto manufacturing expert at the consulting firm Oliver Wyman."}

{"text": "Q: Can someone really be \"big-boned\"?\n\nA: Yes—but most people aren't. People like to say, \"I'm not overweight; I'm just big-boned!\" to justify a higher number on the scale, but in reality, less than 20 percent of women actually have larger-than-average body frames. (They're typically tall and have greater bone density and more muscle than most women—think Venus Williams.) About the same percentage of women have naturally tiny builds, and the rest of us fall somewhere in between. Besides, frame size usually accounts for only moderate differences in weight—10 pounds at most. My advice? Forget about your frame if you really want to know whether your weight is healthy. While still an imperfect measure, body mass index can be a good way for the average woman to get a read on her weight (calculate yours at glamour.com/health). And measure your waist, too. A midsection larger than 35 inches around means you're carrying too much abdominal fat and are at greater risk for diabetes, heart disease and stroke."}

To do so I need certain tools in the private match update that is coming. I can't do it without Respawn's help.\n\nThe 4 tools I need are:\n\n1. Free spectate mode. With the ability to remove the HUD completely.\n\n\n2. Friendly fire mode. Ability to shoot your own teammates.\n\n\n3. Ability to have more than 12 people in a game. As many as possible.\n\n\n4. Disable minions option.\n\nThe free spectate mode is paramount, without that the rest would not help. With these 4 options in Private Matches on Titanfall I'll be ready to start filming the Machinima series for my channel.\n\nThe series itself would be called Titanfall: IMC vs Militia and would be a community voice acted original story.

{"text": "I think the idea of a plastic -- moisture-proof, bug-proof, etc. -- container for storing the artificial Christmas tree is genius. Especially useful as the original box the tree came in starts to fall apart. I have a 7 - 7.5 foot pre-lit tree that breaks down into 3 sections with branches that fold up. Reading the information about this container convinced me that it would be large enough to store this tree. Well, in order to get the tree into the box, I had to first tie each section tightly to try to compress the branches. It was still to large to be able to put the lid on the box, but with pushing and shoving and the use of lots of duct tape, I was able to get the tree in the box. I think there was one box that was larger, but by the time I made my purchase that one was gone. Seasonal merchandise, so when it's gone, it's gone :-( I would still recommend this product though because I think it is a good storage option.

Hundreds of South Korean workers crossed the border today to resume operations at the factory park, one of the only symbols of cooperation between North and South Korea and their only remaining joint project, Reuters reports.

During weeks of negotiations, North and South Korea set up a joint management committee for the complex, and that committee has agreed to expand South Korean access to the site. The complex will also be opened to foreign investors, which could make it more difficult for North Korea to shutter it again in the future.

I don't hate her because the situation is so petty and not important to anyone's life but I'm not rooting for her so I guess it upset me enough to sway me against her like that lol"}

{"text": "The signing of Quina by West Ham was another coup for the east London club with big ambitions, especially given where he had come from and who wanted him. The player had been at Chelsea previously, and there was strong interest from Arsenal in signing him but he surprised many by agreeing a scholarship deal at West Ham, rather than clubs who traditionally promise young players more lucrative first professional deals.\n\nIt will be up to West Ham to apply to Fifa for international clearance to sign the 16-year-old who, under the governing body's regulations, can move to a club in a European Union country other than the one on his passport as long as certain conditions are met. The transfer of under-18s is allowed cross-border within the EU only as long as the player's schooling and football development, as well as his accommodation, are demonstrated to be comparable or better than they were in the country he is leaving.\n\nProviding West Ham get clearance from Fifa, the club will switch Quina to his first professional contract when he turns 17 on Nov 18. For Chelsea, losing a player of that quality will come as a blow although it is understood that he was never registered at the academy."}

And in developing countries, false beliefs have hindered efforts to fight H.I.V./AIDS and eradicate polio in countries like Nigeria and Pakistan.\n\nThe latest example of the dangers of health misinformation comes from Western Africa, where the response to an Ebola outbreak in four countries has been hampered by conspiracy theories about its causes and phony rumors about how to treat it. False beliefs may not be the biggest obstacle to containing the Ebola outbreak, but they make an awful situation worse.\n\nPeople in the affected regions have become especially distrustful of doctors, with some suggesting the disease is a hoax. A resident of a heavily affected area in Liberia told The Wall Street Journal last week: \"I've never seen anybody die of Ebola. I've only heard of it.

Why are they happier?\n\nLong-time political activist Adam Leonas examines the arguments about the oppression of women, and shows that all the supposed disadvantages are essentially trade-offs against much worse alternatives.\n\nHe takes a fascinating look into the biology of the sexes, to find where female superiority and male weakness is located: sex. He argues that the point in history when the prehistoric gender balance was overturned was during \"the worst mistake in human history\": the Agricultural Revolution, when what he calls \"the Female Coup d'etat\" took place.\n\nThe author, being unrelentingly radically progressive, concludes that in historic societies, capitalism included, women's power is greater due to their control over sex. He proposes radical ways for men to deal with their disadvantaged position, as well as radical ways to remedy the gender balance in society as a necessary prerequisite for equality and social peace.\n\nRead excerpts from the book.\n\nThe Table of Contents.\n\nReview by National Coalition for Men PR Director J.

{"text": "Increasing evidence implicates functional deficiencies or imbalances of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids in dyslexia. The associations between literacy skills and omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid status were examined. 32 dyslexics and 20 controls completed standardised tests of reading and spelling and gave venous blood samples for analysis of the polar lipid fatty acid composition of red blood cell (RBC) membranes. Relationships between literacy skills and omega-3 and omega-6 concentrations were examined using rank-order correlations. Better word reading was associated with higher total omega-3 concentrations in both dyslexic and control groups. In dyslexic subjects only, reading performance was negatively associated with the ratio of arachidonic acid/eicosapentaenoic acid (ARA/EPA) and with total omega-6 concentrations. There were no significant differences in membrane fatty acid levels between the dyslexic and control subjects. However, the finding that omega-3 status was directly related to reading performance irrespective of dyslexia supports a dimensional view of this condition, and our results also suggest that it is the omega-3/omega-6 balance that is particularly relevant to dyslexia."}

Though located in France, US researchers would have a direct line to the massive project, which aims to help transition fusion from the experimental phase to a practical reactor. Once MIT found out that its own reactor would be cut, however, it mobilized its lobbying arm, and convinced local congressman Michael Capuano that it was worth saving. He recruited a group including Senator Elizabeth Warren, which pitched other other representatives on the merits of the project. They emphasized the patriotic angle by showing a map with hundreds of subcontractors in 47 of 50 states which supplied the project.\n\nIn the end, the Senate decided to throw $22 million MIT's way to keep the project alive until 2016, while chopping ITER funding by $25 million. One skeptic pointed out that such funds would be used by MIT for a five week experiment by 12 graduate students. \"This would be $1.5 million per student.\" Still, the reactor has now been re-started with a ceremonial button push by Senator Warren -- check out the entire saga at the Globe right here.\n\n[Image credit: Chris Bolin, Wikimedia Commons]"}

{"text": "The human gut microbiota is composed of more than 100 trillion microbes. Most communities are dominated by species belonging to the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia. Microflora-derived short-chain fatty acids play a pivotal role in the framework of insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. They are an important energy source and are involved in several pathways, with proatherogenic and antiatherogenic effects. The increased gut microbiota lipopolysaccharide levels (defined as \"metabolic endotoxemia\") induce a state of low-grade inflammation and are involved in atherosclerotic disease through Toll-like receptor 4. Another important inflammatory trigger in gut microbiota‐mediated atherosclerotic promotion is trimethylamine N-oxide. On the other hand, protocatechuic acid was found to promote cholesterol efflux from macrophages, showing an antiatherogenic effect. Further studies to clarify specific gut composition involved in cardiometabolic syndrome and atherogenesis are needed for greater use of targeted approaches.\n\nNo References for this article.\n\nNo Supplementary Data.\n\nNo Article Media\n\nNo Metrics"}

{"text": "An extended article on this topic can be found here.\n\nMany women experience some degree of sleep disturbance during pregnancy. For a significant number of women, the sleep disruption may be so severe as to require some type of intervention. In a previous post, we discussed the use of different types of medications to treat insomnia during pregnancy. While these drugs are highly effective, many women with sleep problems inquire about the use of \"natural\" agents, such as melatonin, during pregnancy.\n\nMelatonin is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland which is involved in regulating normal sleep-wake cycles. It is also sold over the counter as a nutritional supplement and is a popular natural remedy for sleep problems.\n\nWhen it comes to pregnancy, however, natural does not necessarily mean safer. Although melatonin is indeed \"natural\" and is normally produced by the body, the amount delivered by various over-the-counter preparations typically exceeds the quantities normally produced by the body. As is the case with most supplements, we know very little about the impact these high levels of hormones may have on the developing fetus. Thus, we typically advise women with sleep problems to use medications with a better characterized reproductive safety profile.\n\nRuta Nonacs, MD PhD"}

{"text": "Litigation against police agencies for the use and misuse of control agents and procedures has become an important issue for the forensic medical specialist and expert witness. As police technology improves, it becomes apparent that more information for forensic experts will be required in this area. One such area of concern is the use of tear gas by police. This paper addresses the basic types of gas in terms of their chemistry, uses, and medical side effects and complications. Two types of gases--namely, chloroacetophenone (CN) and orthochlorobenzylidenemalontrile (CS)--are discussed in terms of basic properties, unique advantages, and possible harm to the body. CN and CS are relatively safe agents that can be used to control the behavior of a dangerous person. Clinical examples of their use and misuse by police are also reported. Specific guidelines are offered to help ensure a proper assessment of the dangerous person and to protect the health and lives of police personnel, perpetrators, and others exposed to the tear gas. Forensic experts called to testify about the behavior of the disturbed person or to assess the appropriateness of action taken to subdue that person must become more aware of the technology employed by police agencies to accomplish this particular job of protecting public safety."}

Subjects started at 168 ± 11% of ideal body weight, lost 30.3 ± 3.7 kg in 5–7 mo, followed by 2+ mo in weight maintenance. Serum cholesterol fell from a prediet (baseline) value of 5.49 ± 0.32 to 3.62 ± 0.31 mmol/L (P < 0.01) after 1–2 mo of VLCDs (nadir), after which it rose to 5.95 ± 0.36 mmol/ L (peak, P < 0.01 compared with nadir and baseline) as weight loss continued. With weight maintenance, serum cholesterol fell to 4.92 ± 0.34 mmol/L (P < 0.05 compared with peak). Adipose cholesterol content did not change in peripheral (arm and leg) biopsy sites but rose significantly in abdominal adipose tissue with weight loss. We conclude that major weight loss was associated with a late rise in serum cholesterol, possibly from mobilization of adipose cholesterol stores, which resolved when weight loss ceased."}

{"text": "A beard-second is a measurement of length based on the distance that a beard hair grows in one second of time. This is similar, in structure though not in quantitative value, to a light-year, which is a measurement of length equal to the distance that light travels in one year. While a light-year is a very long distance, due to the tremendous speed of light, the beard-second is quite small since hair grows at a very slow rate. The exact length that this equals is the basis for some debate, and some sources cite it at about 10 nanometers (nm) while other sources use only 5 nm.\n\nThere are a number of ridiculous or unnecessarily complicated measurements used, often unofficially, in physics and engineering. In quantum physics, and other disciplines that use extremely small measurements of distance and space, one such measurement is the beard-second. There are two different values that can be used for the beard-second, based on the fact that beard follicles can grow at different rates on different people. The larger of the two measurements is 10 nm, while the smaller measurement is 5 nm in length; a nanometer is one-billionth of a meter (m), or about three-billionths of a foot, in length."}

The loss of the arch may have an impact on Morocco's tourism sector, which saw a fall in overseas visitors in the first half of 2016.

Later this year, the Fire TV Stick 2 and the Fire TV 2 will receive the update first, and the Fire TV Stick 1 and Fire TV 1 will follow.\n\nAs for new features, apart from the complete interface overhaul, the press release says there will now be \"a customizable apps list on the home screen,\" which is a feature that so many of us Fire TV owners have been wanting for a long time. Amazon also says the new interface \"will present a cinematic experience\" and let \"customers access the content they want more quickly – without the need to open and close multiple apps.\" I'm not entirely sure what that means, but my guess is they're referring to a tighter integration of Amazon Channels, which do let you view content from other networks through the Fire TV's default interface, instead of individual apps.\n\nShareTweetShare+1"}

I have consistently identified myself based on what I knew to be true. My enrollment status does not impact my Cherokee identity or my continued commitment to organizing for justice for Native communities.\n\nThere have been innumerable false statements made about me in the media. But ultimately what is most concerning is that these social media attacks send a chilling message to all Native peoples who are not enrolled, or who are otherwise marginalized, that they should not publicly work for justice for Native peoples out of fear that they too may one day be attacked. It is my hope that more Indigenous peoples will answer the call to work for social justice without fear of being subjected to violent identity-policing. I also hope the field of Native studies might attend to disagreement and difference in a manner that respects the dignity of all persons rather than through abusive social media campaigns.\n\nOut of respect for the dignity and privacy of my family, and out of concern for the damage that these attacks have had on my students, colleagues, and organizing communities, I will direct my energies back to the work of social justice."}

{"text": "In this comedy from Austin Powers director Jay Roach, Ben Stiller plays a young man who endures a disastrous weekend at the home of his girlfriend's parents. Greg Focker (Stiller) is completely in love with Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo), and views their upcoming trip to her parents' house on Long Island (where her sister is to be married during the weekend) as a perfect opportunity to ask her to marry him. Once Greg is introduced to Pam's parents, however, things stampede steadily downhill. Pam's father, Jack (Robert De Niro), takes an instant and obvious dislike to his daughter's boyfriend, lambasting him for his job as a nurse and generally making Greg painfully aware of the differences between him and Pam's family. Where Greg is grubby, relatively unambitious, and Jewish, Pam comes from a long line of well-mannered, blue-blooded WASPs. Things go from bad to worse in less time than it takes to spin a dreidel, with Greg incurring the wrath of both Pam's father -- who, it turns out, worked for the CIA for 34 years -- and the rest of her family, and almost single-handedly destroying their house and the wedding in the process. ~ Rebecca Flint Marx, Rovi"}

That job goes to Greg McMillin, a former intern with the organization. The international operations department was further bolstered with the addition of Rafael Alvarez as international scout, the promotion of Ray Robles to assistant director of international operations, and the assignment of Elvis Fernandez to manage the team's Dominican Republic academy.\n\nThe organization also hired Bryan Minniti, previously assistant general manager of the Arizona Diamondbacks, to be a special assistant to general manager Matt Klentak. Jorge Velandia, promoted from within and reportedly an advocate of drafting Odubel Herrera in the Rule 5, will also serve as a special assistant.\n\nMoreover, the Phils added a mental-skills coach, giving that job to Geoff Miller, who has worked in that realm with the Braves, Nationals and Pirates.\n\nAlso announced were minor league managing appointments, including Gregg Legg to Reading. Legg oversaw single-A Clearwater in 2015. And former Phillie Charlie Hayes will be taking a coaching position with the Gulf Coast Phillies.\n\nMore scouting, coaching and analyst positions were also announced Tuesday."}
{"text": "The miniseries adaptation of The Man In The High Castle was originally announced as a project back in 2010. At the time, the four-parter based on Philip K Dick's novel, was to be a Headline Pictures/Electric Shepherd/Scott Free production for the BBC, scripted by British playwright Howard Brenton and sold internationally by FremantleMedia. Some of the puzzle pieces have since shifted. Syfy said today it has sealed a deal to adapt the Hugo Award-winning tome with Frank Spotnitz (The X-Files, Hunted) attached to write and exec produce. Ridley Scott's Scott Free will produce with Headline, Electric Shepherd Productions (the production arm of Dick's estate) and FremantleMedia International. Producers are Ridley Scott and Stewart Mackinnon. Spotnitz will write the first two hours and supervise the writing of the second two hours, Syfy said today.\n\nDick's novel is an alternate history story set in a world in which Nazi Germany and Japan were victorious in the second World War. The year is 1962 and the Axis Powers occupy the U.S., where fascism rules and the few surviving Jews hide under assumed names. Scott's 1982 sci-fi classic Blade Runner was adapted from Dick's Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?"}

{"text": "best priced managed switch you can buy\n\nGood: Cisco 2950 has 24 ports, all of which can be either used as they come, or can be configured for a specific purpose. For the price, you cannot purchase a new switch of equal value in a store, its just not possible. The amount of settings and configurations you can choose is huge, which comes in handy. The ability to define and implement VLANs is reason enough to buy a switch of this caliber. Bad: buying anything Cisco requires some information to use. You need to be familiar with Cisco IOS and own a serial console cable to configure it. The ugly: the switch I purchased still had old config files on it from the previous owner, which meant it was password protected. I needed to reference the cisco website ( or Cisco CCNA Portable Command Guide)to find the steps to override the password, which can only be done with physical access to the switch itself. After that, works flawlessly. ( which just means that somebody was lazy when the decommissioned their equipment, potentially leaving behind traces of corporate network information) Overall, Cisco equipment is built like a tank, and a great deal to find used. I love my switch, and I'm sure anyone else that is looking for quality equipment will too.Read full review"}

{"text": "Implantable silicon microelectrode array technology is a useful technique for obtaining high-density, high-spatial resolution sampling of neuronal activity within the brain and holds promise for a wide range of neuroprosthetic applications. One of the limitations of the current technology is inconsistent performance in long-term applications. Although the brain tissue response is believed to be a major cause of performance degradation, the precise mechanisms that lead to failure of recordings are unknown. We observed persistent ED1 immunoreactivity around implanted silicon microelectrode arrays implanted in adult rat cortex that was accompanied by a significant reduction in nerve fiber density and nerve cell bodies in the tissue immediately surrounding the implanted silicon microelectrode arrays. Persistent ED1 up-regulation and neuronal loss was not observed in microelectrode stab controls indicating that the phenotype did not result from the initial mechanical trauma of electrode implantation, but was associated with the foreign body response. In addition, we found that explanted electrodes were covered with ED1/MAC-1 immunoreactive cells and that the cells released MCP-1 and TNF-alpha under serum-free conditions in vitro. Our findings suggest a potential new mechanism for chronic recording failure that involves neuronal cell loss, which we speculate is caused by chronic inflammation at the microelectrode brain tissue interface."}

From Jared Kushner's meetings with media industry \"deal-makers\" to the launch of a nightly Facebook Live broadcast, signs continue to point to the eventual launch of Trump TV. Now there's the revelation that the Trump Organization already owns three key URLs that could point to a future in the media business: TrumpTelevision.com, TrumpNetwork.com, and TheTrumpNetwork.com.\n\nThe latter two addresses once hosted content for a multilevel marketing company that sold vitamins and licensed Trump's name to help dupe people into joining. TrumpTelevision.com, on the other hand, appears to have never hosted anything, according to Yahoo. The Trump Organization has owned these sites since at least December 2012, but they've taken on a new relevance in light of Trump's rumored television ambitions. There's a chance that the Trump Organization is just sitting on these websites so no one else uses them, like it's doing with TrumpVodkaSucks.com and NoMoreTrump.com. But there's also a chance they will soon be home to a TV network that, as Trump might say, is so good \"your head will spin.\""}

Using establishment-level data, we show that firms that tightened their debt capacity in the run-up to the Great Recession (\"highleverage firms\") exhibit a significantly larger decline in employment in response to household demand shocks than firms that freed up debt capacity (\"low-leverage firms\"). In fact, all of the job losses associated with falling house prices during the Great Recession are concentrated among establishments of high-leverage firms. At the county level, we show that counties with a larger fraction of establishments belonging to high-leverage firms exhibit a significantly larger decline in employment in response to household demand shocks.

I took my Dremel with grinding wheel and ground slightly on both sides, basically just took the paint off. That solved the problem. All my 10rd and 25rd mags now can drop free even unloaded. Some people commented on the Internet forums that the finish of this stock was not very durable. I can confirm that their comment was true. I've taken it to the range just once so far, shot about 200 rounds, and didn't handle it roughly at all, I already got a couple small nicks and dings on the stock. My original stock which is 5 years old, got about some number of nicks and scratches as this new one. Also I wish EAB would make a rubber buttpad for this stock, same style/thickness as the metal one, just made of rubber. Rubber buttpad will help the gun not slide down and fall to the ground, when I lean it against the wall on some slick floor like marble.\n\ndoublebarrel\n\n4\n\nReviewed by:from Indianapolis on 10/28/2015"}

{"text": "AP\n\nAs the shocking trade of Percy Harvin to the Jets continues to dominate the NFL news cycle, reports from Seattle indicate that the Seahawks simply decided they couldn't tolerate Harvin's misbehavior, which included multiple fights with teammates and a refusal to play late in Sunday's loss to the Cowboys.\n\nOne fight took place the week before the Super Bowl and left then-Seahawks receiver Golden Tate with a black eye, according to Lance Zierlein of Sports Talk 790 in Houston. Another fight took place in the preseason this year and left receiver Doug Baldwin with a cut on his chin, according to the Seattle Times.\n\nHarvin also reportedly took himself out of Sunday's game and wouldn't go back in when coaches asked him to play. Seahawks coach Pete Carroll was asked why Harvin didn't play much late in the game and answered with a vague reference to \"readiness,\" but it now appears that the real problem was \"willingness,\" or lack thereof, of Harvin to get on the field.\n\nCombining the reports out of Seattle with the widespread reports from two years ago that Harvin was a cancer in the Vikings' locker room, it looks like the Jets just landed themselves a malcontent. They'd better have a plan for how to deal with Harvin's inevitable unhappiness."}

{"text": "The main goal of this article is to the present research on the development of ketamine derivatives. The target molecule was a fluoroderivative of ketamine, for which a multistep synthesis has been reported. This novel ketamine derivative, 2-(2-fluorophenyl)-2-methylamino-cyclohexanone, has been called fluoroketamine by our research group. The starting fluorobenzonitrile was reacted with the appropriate Grignard reagent followed by the bromination reaction to obtain α-bromocyclopentyl-(2-fluorophenyl)-ketone. The reaction of the obtained ketone with methylamine at −40 °C then resulted in the formation of α-hydroxycyclopentyl-(2-flourophenyl)-N-methylamine. Finally, the five-memberd ring cyclopentanol was expanded to the cyclohexylketone by a thermal rearrangement reaction. The HCl salt of the target molecule, which is soluble in water, was obtained by the acidification of the free fluoroketamine with HCl. Preliminary animal tests on mice have shown that the resulting fluoroketamine has some advantages over ketamine in terms of the effective dose and the recovery time."}

Like the previous weekend, Mike, Katy, and I had been thinking about this one for a while. With an early start from Jackson and a brief stop in Canyon for our backcountry permit, we were on the trail at about 9:30. Two hours later, after hiking along the rim of the canyon and passing through an active geothermal area as we descended to the river, we were setting up camp and fishing shortly thereafter.\n\nExpectations were for the fishing to be nonstop action, and it pretty much was. We started using various foam attractors and had pretty good luck. It wasn't until Katy had the bright idea to switch to big stonefly patterns, after we were surprised to see quite a few flying around still, that the fishing really got going.\n\nIt's tough to say how many fish were caught, not to mention how many more we lost, missed, didn't bother setting the hook on, or that refused our flies. With that said we easily brought up 100 fish between us.\n\nAfter working the majority of the accessible water, which really isn't all that much, we were cooking dinner at camp just as the last light of the day was hitting the high canyon cliffs."}

{"text": "Great Book not right for everyone\n\nExcellent narration is the cap to the fascinating and enjoyable novel. As much as I enjoyed this novel, I can see that many people would really not appreciate it. This is largely an inner stream of consciousness and there are a lot of four letter words and frank thoughts about sex and death. In the first chapter involving a death from cancer I was literally laughing and crying and nauseated and uplifted at the same time. I don't mean alternately, I mean at the very same instant. This is pretty unusual writing. I was thinking Gen-X meets James Joyce. The characters, even some very minor characters, are quite well presented. If you want a story where the protagonist faces adversity only to take heart and overcome, you might not want this book (but maybe you should read it anyway). The characters do change, but not in pat ways, instead in the ways people really change. The protagonist is often not very likeable, yet he is human and the beauty of his existence sporadically flashes through. I am nearly as far as it gets from being a Gen-Xer but I really liked this book. The narration more than does justice to the text, shouting and crying, mumbling and enunciating when the writing called for it.\n\n23 of 24 people found this review helpful"}

{"text": "The Nexus is dead. Long live the Pixel. Google on Tuesday announced a new pair of flagship phones, the 5-inch Pixel and 5.5-inch Pixel XL, and proclaimed that, this time, for real, it's serious about selling smartphone hardware. To that end, it positioned the new devices as high-end phones with appropriately high-end prices: $649 and $769, respectively.\n\nAs this chart from Statista shows, though, this isn't the first time Google has dabbled with premium hardware. While it's true that most Nexus phones were pitched as affordable and \"good enough,\" 2014's Nexus 6 and 2011's Galaxy Nexus (initially, at least) started at the same $649 price tag as the standard Pixel. Perhaps not coincidentally, both of those were sold through Verizon as well.\n\nYes, the Pixel is not the Nexus. The software is more customized, and Google has reportedly been more hands-on in the development process. But it still isn't making the phones (HTC is), and the benefits of owning them (fast updates) will be similar to before. Really, the biggest difference here seems to be marketing — Google has gone all out to make these look like its own smartphones. Time will tell if that's enough to help Pixel succeed where Nexus faltered."}

Its funny, I used to watch LOTR and think, \"Legolas soooo hot!\" Now when I watch it I think \"Aragorn soooo hot!\" Probably in a couple of decades I'll be thinking, \"Gandalf sooo hot!\"\n\nThe other way my taste has changed over time is so much less interest in physical appearance and more attracted to guys with great personalities who have their life together. Now if I find myself thinking someone is attractive its because he's a really cool, accomplished, confident guy not because of how symmetrical his facial features are or how ripped his abs are. My husband is the hottest man I know. He is funny, smart, witty, confident and successful. He's also fat & gray-haired these days but IDGAF about that. Which is nice.

Cuts will come across the country, at office locations including Calgary, Toronto, Winnipeg, Halifax and Montreal.\n\nEarlier this year, the company warned in its quarterly results that minimum wage hikes would cost it an extra $190 million in 2018, and it would be looking to cut costs where it can to offset those increases.\n\nWhile laying off staff in some areas, the company is also aggressively investing in other areas of the business, including omni-channel and its fast-growing financial services division.\n\n​\"This is ultimately about our future,\" Groh said. \"To invest meaningfully in promising areas means saving meaningfully in others.\"\n\n\"We will continue to invest and we will be a net job creator again this year,\" Groh said."}

For two years, the gangleaders recruited manpower, wooed investors, forged links with the mob, stockpiled weapons, and planned their assault. They called it Operation Red Dog. They were going to make millions. All that stood in their way were two federal agents from Louisiana on the biggest case of their lives. Bayou of Pigs tells a remarkable story of foreign military intervention, revolutionary politics, greed, treachery, stupidity, deceit, and one of the most outlandish crimes ever attempted: the theft of a nation.\n\n\nStewart Bell (Toronto, ON) is the author of Cold Terror (978-0-470-84056-6).

If you are in need of an family-friendly activity, a Christmas-themed play is a great way to get into the spirit of the holiday season. Tinseltown Christmas is a musical being performed at the Patio Playhouse Community Theatre. Performances take place from November 20th to December 20th on Fridays & Saturdays at 8:00pm and Sundays at 2:00pm.\n\nThis play is about two disagreeable neighbors named Monica and Steve who don't enjoy living next to each other. They are however, able to agree on the uselessness of Christmas in their lives along with people's disingenuous Christmas cheer that comes with the season.\n\nAs in the classic story A Christmas Carol, ghosts from the past come to change the tune of the humbugs. This time the ghosts are from Hollywood's golden era. They include Jimmy Stewart, Judy Garland, Natalie Wood, and Bing Crosby. These spectral stars do more than drum up yuletide cheer. They also come to cook up romance between the two.\n\nThis play is suitable for the whole family. Come join the actors in a night of fun and song! Patio Playhouse Community Theatre is located at 116 S Kalmia Street, Escondido, CA 92025 between Vinz Wine Bar and Continental Deli."}
{"text": "Only a small percentage of the Cuban population currently has access to the internet, but that may be starting to change. According to the Union of Journalists of Cuba, the state-run telecom provider ETECSA plans to begin offering Wi-Fi service in Santiago de Cuba — the country's second largest city. That'll make accessing the internet somewhat easier for its residents, who typically have to use computers and connections at schools, offices, or government facilities. The fact that Wi-Fi will allow residents to connect phones and tablets should also be a big help, as those devices can be far less expensive than a traditional computer.\n\nEven with Wi-Fi, internet access will still not be widely accessible. A fairly slow internet connection will reportedly cost $4.50 per hour — a prohibitively expensive price for many in a country where the average monthly income is just $20. That price apparently isn't even out of line with typical internet charges in the country, which may be double that or more in some locations. Still, accessible Wi-Fi will be a big change. The AFP reports that citizens typically need government approval in order to install a router, and generally only people of certain occupations — such as doctors and journalists — are even allowed to get internet at home. However slowly, Cuba is beginning to open up, and this is certainly a step in that direction."}

They have a very long and sordid history of targeting minorities with their hate and too, too often does that hate transfer to murderous violence. By their own admission, these shit-for-brains use their rallies and marches to intimidate their victims. A racist march doubles as a recruiting tool and a statement; \"minorities of this community, we are here, we hate you and we want you gone\".

{"text": "IN BRITAIN'S \"first-past-the-post\" electoral system, seats won at a general election are not shared out between the parties proportionally nationwide. Instead each one of the 650 constituencies is self-contained, meaning any vote not used to win a seat is in effect wasted. In 2010 over 900,000 people voted for the populist UK Independence Party at the general election. They needn't have bothered: UKIP didn't win a single seat in the House of Commons. The Liberal Democrats (the best-known loser from this majoritarian system) joined the Tories in a coalition government after the 2010 election, but over 5.5m of its 6.8m votes made no contribution to its 57 seats. Under a proportional system its votes would have translated to 150 seats. At the 2015 election the Scottish National Party became the first minor party to win a number of seats in Westminster that outweigh its share of the popular vote.\n\nOur interactive diagram above shows the outcome of general elections since 1997, including the 2015 result. The ring segments signify each party's share of the vote. Each filled square denotes a seat won by the party; each empty square shows additional seats it would have gained under a directly proportional system. Seats outside the ring represent those obtained beyond proportional allocation.\n\n\nFor more election graphics, visit our \"data hub\" here."}

{"text": "In \"Prayers for Bobby,\" Mary Griffith (Sigourney Weaver) is a devout Christian who raises her children with the conservative teachings of the Presbyterian Church. However, when her son Bobby (Ryan Kelley) confides to his older brother he may be gay, life changes for the entire family after Mary learns about his secret. While Bobby's father (Henry Czerny) and siblings slowly come to terms with his homosexuality, Mary believes God can cure him of what she considers his 'sin' and persuades Bobby to pray harder and seek solace in church activities in hopes of changing him. Desperate for his mother's approval, Bobby does what is asked of him, but through it all, the church's apparent disapproval of homosexuality causes him to grow increasingly withdrawn and depressed. Guilty over the pain he is causing Mary, Bobby moves away, yet hopes that some day his mother will accept him. His subsequent depression and self-loathing intensifies as he blames himself for not being the 'perfect' son and is driven to suicide. Faced with their tragedy, Mary begins to question her faith when she receives no answers from her pastor concerning her devastating loss. Through her long and emotional journey, Mary slowly reaches out to the gay community and discovers unexpected support from a very unlikely source.

{"text": "The Caves of Steel\n\nIsaac Asimov\n\nIn this novel, Isaac Asimov introduces Elijah Baley and R. Daneel Olivaw, who would later become his favorite protagonists. They live roughly three millennia in Earth's future, a time when hyperspace travel has been discovered, and a few worlds relatively close to Earth have been colonized—fifty planets known as the \"Spacer Worlds\". The Spacer worlds are rich, have low population density (average population of one hundred million each), and use robot labor very heavily. Meanwhile, Earth is overpopulated (with a total population of eight billion), and strict rules against robots have been passed. The eponymous \"caves of steel\" are vast city complexes covered by huge metal domes, capable of supporting tens of millions each. The New York City of that era, for example, encompasses present-day New York City, as well as large tracts of New Jersey. Asimov imagines the present day's underground transit connected to malls and apartment blocks, extended to a point where no one ever exits to the outside world. Indeed, most of the population cannot leave, as they suffer from extreme agoraphobia.

We're guessing it's happened to you more times than you'd like to recall. To help alleviate the stress, app maker SwayMarkets decided to figure out exactly why it happens.\n\nSo...why? It's pretty simple, acutally. Whenever a large group of people gather in one area, everyone is fighting for access to the same wireless cell site. If too many people attempt to gain access, the site will get bogged down and crap out. SwayMarket's founders took three iPhones, one from Sprint, Verizon, and AT&T, and went to Fenway Park for a Red Sox game to see how each responded using the compay's CarrierCompare software. The results were surprising.\n\nThe iPhones from Sprint and Verizon stopped working, while the one from AT&T kept chugging, albiet much, much slower than usual. The good news is that wireless carriers are working on solutions. Instead of relying on cell towers, some companies are testing small atennas that can be deployed around heavily populated areas to increase cell coverage.\n\nPOST CONTINUES BELOW\n\n[via CNN]"}

From the campaign through his first 100 days in office, President Trump adroitly exploited the most conspicuous downsides of trade in portraying himself as a hero to those who go to work in coveralls.\n\nBut as economic policy, the feisty words — quickly downgraded to a pledge to \"renegotiate\" terms of trade with Mexico and Canada — potentially imperil significant swaths of the American economy.\n\nA rupture to trade with those two countries would disrupt the global supply chain, jeopardizing factories in the United States that depend on imported components in making their wares. It could raise the costs of shoes, clothing and other consumer goods, while discouraging investment amid the uncertainty. It would threaten reprisals from trading partners, risking barriers to American exports.\n\nIt could cost jobs in the name of saving them.\n\n\"Re-creating trade barriers between the United States and Mexico will hurt many of the people Trump is ostensibly trying to help,\" said Pietra Rivoli, a trade expert at the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown. \"We can expect higher prices for many consumer goods, and we can expect negative effects for our many firms that rely on Mexico for inputs.\""}

After it's printed I will cut down one of the hex keys and press fit it into the hub.\n\nEdit: As soon as the glue dries, I can snap the yellow pieces together, and it will get used for at least a few days until the next orthodontist appointment.\n\nEdit 27FEB2017:\n\nI had a successful use of the home printed version on Saturday, then on Sunday my daughter found her original key so we went back to the OEM version.

The trick to access it, is to equip Undine's soul (to be able to walk on the water's surface), and then equip and activate either the Curly's, Manticore's or Devil's soul to dash through the waterfall. Soma will receive the Eversing armor along the way and find the door leading to the Forbidden Area on the other side. Once inside, Soma may open the alternate path to the Study by going to the uppermost room, where he'll find a switch. Stepping on it will lower the gate that blocks the passage between the two places.\n\nThis area also has many treasure chests that give off considerable amounts of gold.

Wood argues that the emergence of the peasant as citizen, juridically and politically independent, accounts for much that is remarkable in Athenian political institutions and culture.\n\n\nFrom a survey of historical writings of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the focus of which distorted later debates, Wood goes on to take issue with influential arguments, such as those of G.E.M. de Ste Croix, about the importance of slavery in agricultural production. The social, political and cultural influence of the peasant-citizen is explored in a way which questions some of the most cherished conventions of Marxist and non-Marxist historiography."}

{"text": "Economic Espionage\n\nEconomic espionage is a problem that costs the American economy hundreds of billions of dollars per year and puts our national security at risk. While it is not a new threat, it is a growing one, and the theft attempts by foreign competitors and adversaries are becoming more brazen and varied. The FBI estimates that hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars are lost to foreign competitors every year. These foreign competitors deliberately target economic intelligence in advanced technologies and flourishing U.S. industries.\n\nWhat is Economic Espionage?\n\nAccording to the Economic Espionage Act (Title 18 U.S.C. §1831), economic espionage is (1) whoever knowingly performs targeting or acquisition of trade secrets to (2) knowingly benefit any foreign government, foreign instrumentality, or foreign agent. In contrast, the theft of trade secrets (Title 18 U.S.C. Section 1832) is (1) whoever knowingly misappropriates trade secrets to (2) benefit anyone other than the owner.\n\nHistorically, economic espionage has targeted defense-related and high-tech industries. But recent FBI cases have shown that no industry, large or small, is immune to the threat. Any company with a proprietary product, process, or idea can be a target; any unprotected trade secret is vulnerable to theft by those who wish to illegally obtain innovations to increase their market share at a victim company's expense."}

Their discovery is important because most exoplanets, those orbiting other stars, have been gas giants like Saturn or Jupiter. \"Astronomers are just beginning to confirm thousands of planet candidates uncovered by Kepler so far,\" Doug Hudgins, a scientist with the Kepler program said in a press release. \"Finding one as small as Mars is amazing, and hints that there may be a bounty of rocky planets all around us.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon't expect to visit these planets, however, and not because of their remote distance.

{"text": "The Patriots are interested in free agent right tackle Eric Winston, a league source told ESPN's NFL Insider Adam Schefter.\n\nWinston was released by the Chiefs earlier this offseason just one year into a four-year free agent deal that made him one of the highest paid right tackles in the NFL. The Chiefs have turned their franchise over this offseason, and could be in the market for an offensive tackle with the first overall pick.\n\nWinston is regarded as a strong zone blocking scheme offensive lineman who is capable as a pass protector. He stands at 6-foot-7 and just over 300 pounds, and has started in 103 of 108 career games played.\n\nFrom a Patriots perspective, the interest in Winston could be tied to free agent tackle Sebastian Vollmer, who many believe to be the top remaining offensive lineman on the market. There's been little buzz about Vollmer's status in free agency thus far, but if he is signed elsewhere, the Patriots could add Winston to compete for the starting job.\n\nVollmer is likely looking for a deal that competes with other contracts signed by right tackles this offseason, highlighted by a five-year, $34 million deal given to Gosder Cherilus by the Colts that includes $10 million in guaranteed money.\n\nSchefter reports that Winston is in Miami today to visit the Dolphins, and also has interest from the Eagles, Chargers and Cowboys."}

The book explores epidemiologic methods that are typically used in migrant studies, providing descriptive epidemiology of cancer patterns separately in Chinese, Japanese, Filipino and other Asian ethnic groups including Asian Indians, Koreans, Vietnamese, and other Southeast Asians. A major focus of the volume provides reviews of analytic risk factors for specific cancer sites including lung, colorectal, prostate, breast, liver and more. These chapters aim to explain the increases or decreases in incidence rates of various cancers upon migration, paying attention to changing risk factor prevalence, the importance of timing of exposures, and other co-factors important in the etiology of these cancers. Genetic determinants and gene-environment relationships associated with specific cancers are also discussed.. This first of its kind volume that is devoted to studies of cancer in Asian Americans provides a foundation to better understanding of environmental and lifestyle causes of cancer in this group, identifying gaps in our knowledge, and potential strategies for prevention.\n\nPreview this book »"}

The labels are voluntary, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe labels will include information such as calories, servings per container, serving size and carbohydrates. Some alcohol companies want to use the labels to display low calories and carbohydrates. Beer companies may be less likely to use them, because they don't want to emphasize how many calories their products have, the article notes. Some winemakers won't want the labels to detract from the appearance of their bottles.\n\nMichael Jacobson, Director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said alcohol manufacturers should be required to list alcohol contents on the label. He said in a statement, \"Including fat and carbohydrates on a label could imply that an alcoholic beverage is positively healthful, especially when the drink's alcohol content isn't prominently labeled. In this era of obesity, calorie labeling is critically important to inform or remind consumers that alcoholic drinks are not 'free' when it comes to calories. Finally, a really useful alcohol label would state the government's definition of moderate drinking as no more than one drink per day for women or two drinks per day for men.\"\n\nCurrently, alcohol makers do not have to list ingredients on the label, but they must list substances a person could be sensitive to, such as sulfites, aspartame and certain food colorings."}

I was actually the very first guest, so I have a real affection for this show.\n\nKumail is hosting a marathon of The X-Files at the Cinefamily on Saturday January 16th - he'll be showing a bunch of his favorite episodes and then he's going to give us a sneak peek at the first episode of the new season. Let me give you some insider info here: the episodes Kumail plans on showing are not obvious ones, and any X-Phile will be intrigued by his choices. It would be really damn exciting if this event was just some old episodes and one of the new ones, but there's more! Kumail will be recording a live episode of The X-Files Files, and he's bringing in folks from the show as guests. It's going to be a killer event.\n\nAnd it's going to be FREE. Yes, free. It'll be first come, first served, and they would like you to register at this link, although registration is not a ticket! You're still going to want to get there a early to get in line.\n\nI'll be there, and so, I suspect, will The Truth. I can't wait."}

The music video borrows heavily from Gaspar Noé's 2009 psychedelic fantasy film Enter the Void (which, if you ask Noé, also inspired Kanye West's 2010 music video \"All of the Lights\").\n\n\"I watched that film,\" said Rocky, \"and at the end of the day, we wanted to do something that was inspired, that paid homage to it without taking from that storyline or that plot.\"\n\nThe Jim Jonsin-produced record is the third single from Rocky's sophomore album, At. Long. Last. ASAP., which debuted at #1 on both the Billboard 200 and the R&B/Hip-Hop charts. This is his second consecutive #1 on the Billboard 200. The Harlem native is currently on a joint tour with Tyler the Creator with special guests Danny Brown and Vince Staples. In January 2015, Rocky's record label founder A$AP Yams died of a drug overdose."}

{"text": "Sometime in late 2004, while looking at the blog, Vodkapundit – a great blog, btw – I came across an external link he had to some interesting photos of World War I. What made them of interest was that they were in color! I saved them to my hard drive, and I'm glad I did... the site that had them up ended up removing them.\n\nSo I decided to go looking for others on the web. I came across the site, Gallica, bibliothèque numérique de la Bibliothèque nationale de France, There I found all of the images you see here, but, alas, the text was all in French, and the last time I spoke French with any frequency or fluency was 45 years ago! So, initially, I had to use an online translator to get the English text.\n\nLater, Gert in Canada, Didier in Belgium and David in France helped with translating the original French wording which appears below each photo. Any translations errors which remain I must lay sole claim to.\n\nGiven the number of images, I have categorized them as follows:\n\nAlthough color photography was around prior to 1903, the Lumière brothers, Auguste and Louis, patented the process in 1903 and developed the first color film in 1907. The French army was the primary source of color photos during the course of World War One."}

Urlacher explains:\n\nWe met, had a good time in Vegas, and she came to a game. That was about it. She's a nice girl. And a busy girl -- she goes all out. I don't know what the big deal was. I was single, and we hung out for a while. I didn't even see the [infamous] video, man.

{"text": "Introduction\n\nWe would like to thank Antec for supplying the High Current Gamer HCG-520 review sample.Antec's High Current Gamer PSUs aim at users that do not want to spend a fortune for a basic but good and reliable PSU with decent warranty. They don't offer features like Gold/Platinum efficiency and modular cabling design but they are equipped with a quiet ball bearing fan, Japanese capacitors which grant increased life span and three years warranty. The Antec HCG series consists of five models with capacities spanning from 400W to 900W. Here we should note that we have already tested the HCG-620 in a previous review and were quite satisfied with its performance.In today's review we will rigorously test the Antec HCG-520, which as its model number implies, has 520W capacity and contrary to Antec's strong beliefs in multi-rail PSUs is equipped with a single +12V rail that can provide up to 40A. In addition it is 80 Plus Bronze certified and meets the ErP Lot 6 requirements for less than 1W power consumption in standby. The Antec HCG-520 has two PCIe connectors (6+2 pin) so it supports either a dual power input graphics card or two single power input ones. In general this PSU is suitable for medium-range systems with low power consumption, so we are quite sure that it will be of great interest to many users out there."}

Although this number has dropped about 50% over the past ten years, the Jedi Knights are still the most-selected alternative religion on the Census and make up 0.31% of all the stated religious affiliations in England and Wales.\n\nHowever, it is not only the Jedi Knights who are seeing more members join their ranks: other alternative faiths such as Paganism, Spiritualists, and those who worship heavy metal (we kid you not) have all seen their numbers grow in the Census.\n\nSo, if you want to become a Jedi, where in England can you find an instructor to teach you the ways of the Force? Try moving to Norwich, our young Padawan! The Census report revealed that this city has the third highest proportion of Jedi Knights living there, along with the highest proportion of metal worshippers and Atheists.\n\nPerhaps we'll see a Jedi Temple being built in Merry Olde England someday soon--now that would be something to see when you are vacationing there.

{"text": "Quiarcus wrote:\n\nThis looks pretty interesting: I like the expanded Lifebringer role for controlling the overall group level, though I'm not entirely sure I like the idea of having to identify items before being able to use their BAMs/Diamonds, especially as it draws from the same resource used to resurrect the heroes (by the way, maybe I missed it but I couldn't see how many lifebringer tokens you're meant to start with, I'm probably just missing it somewhere).\n\n\nI also like the idea of the Massive Darkness posing a more persistent threat, with a constant stream of enemies entering the board when it's too quiet. My only trouble with it is that it is a separate deck that has the potential to never be drawn from - thus reducing the variety of enemies that the heroes have left to face. Drawing two cards per hero will completely exhaust a Guard stack in a 5 or 6 player game as the base game only includes 10 for each level. Perhaps just drawing a guard card from the deck equal to the highest levelled hero on the board, or 1 guard and one lesser roaming monster for levels 1 - 3, and 1 guard and 1 greater roaming monster for levels 4 - 6?\n\n\nEither way, thank you for the time and effort you must have put into this. I'm in the middle of a campaign using the standard rules at the moment, but will try these out in the next campaign I start."}

The rules for the competition must list out the value of the prizes, and it is here that Sony appears to have set a new ARV for the PS4, from the usual $399 to $349. The new ARV would see the PS4's price exactly match that of the rival Xbox One console.\n\n\nvia via WholesomeGame\n\nThe Xbox One received a temporary $50 price cut during the holiday sales, which then became a permanent one in the following months. The price cut helped the Xbox One beat the PS4 during the holiday sales period in the US and UK, and the Xbox One also managed to outsell the PS4 during this past April, the first time the console has managed to do this outside of the holiday sales period.\n\n\nIn this context, a PS4 price cut of $50 has been expected by most analysts, and the leaked documents appear to confirm this move, which may happen later this year."}

{"text": "\"Signs point to Dexter Fowler staying in Colorado,\" writes ESPN's Jerry Crasnick, citing both the Rockies' large asking price for the outfielder and potential trade partners' concerns about Fowler's ability to hit outside of Coors Field (Twitter links). Fowler has a career .882 OPS at home and just a .698 OPS on the road over his five-year career, and he put up an even larger set of splits (.984 OPS home/.720 OPS road) in 2012 when he posted a career-best .300/.389/.474 slash line for the Rockies.\n\nA rival executive tells Crasnick that the Rockies are asking for a \"sky high\" return for Fowler, who is projected to get a raise to $4MM in his second year of arbitration eligibility by MLBTR's Matt Swartz. The Braves were interested in Fowler but balked at giving up two top prospects, according to CBS Sports' Danny Knobler. Fowler would have been Atlanta's leadoff hitter, as the Braves are still looking for a table-setter since they intend to use the newly-signed B.J. Upton in the middle of the lineup.\n\nThe Rockies want a similarly large trade package in exchange for Michael Cuddyer, Knobler reports. Cuddyer is seven years older than Fowler but comes with cost-certainty (two years and $21MM remaining on his contract) and is more proven as a hitter outside of Colorado."}

{"text": "John Milius's jingoistic direction and pulpy screenplay fit perfectly into this film version of the Robert E. Howard fantasy story of the sword and sorcery hero, Conan the Barbarian. Complementing Mulius's heavy metal production is Arnold Schwarzenegger's leaden acting, which in any other context would be deadly, but here (as in The Terminator) corresponds nicely with the whole sonorous project. The story begins when a horde of rampaging warriors massacre the parents of young Conan and enslave the young child for years on The Wheel of Pain. The Wheel of Pain seems to have as its only purpose the building up of Conan's muscles, so it's no surprise that one day Conan grows up to become Arnold Schwarzenegger. As the sole survivor of the childhood massacre, Conan is released from slavery and taught the ancient arts of fighting. Transforming himself into a killing machine, Conan travels into the wilderness to seek vengeance on Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones), the man responsible for killing his family. In the wilderness, Conan takes up with the thieves Valeria (Sandahl Bergman) and Subota (Gerry Lopez). The trio comes upon a weird snake cult, linked to Doom, and Conan wants to trek off to Doom's mountain retreat to kill him. But he is prevented from doing that by King Osrik (Max Von Sydow), who wants the trio of warriors to help rescue his daughter who has joined Doom in the hills. ~ Paul Brenner, Rovi"}

{"text": "Come in and check out our newly remodeled fit center!\n\nEveryone at one point or another has had some kind of discomfort while riding a bicycle. It doesn't have to be that way. A proper bike fit can make a huge difference in a rider's overall performance and enjoyment.\n\nProper, however, is the key word. There are many people who claim to be fitting experts. However, most fitting systems simply measure your body and then adjust your bike to put you into position that is based on a predetermined standard. This ignores your unique goals and needs, especially those derived from the dynamics of your body as you ride.\n\nBike Barn offers a professional bicycle fitting service done by experienced, certified fit experts using Specialized's Body Geometry Fitting system - the best and most advanced methodology. 2D and 3D Fits are dynamic - meaning that assessments about fit are tailored to how your body moves during cycling - not just the length of some of your body parts.\n\nEach bike fitting is done by appointment and is tailored to the individual riders needs. We offer bike fittings for everyone from elite racers to everyday riders who want to get more power, comfort, endurance, and fun from their time on the bike.\n\nWhether you're a serious competitive cyclist or a casual rider going out for fun and fitness, our fitting service will significantly enhance your riding.\n\nEmail or call us to set up an appointment at 602-956-3870."}

The results suggest that it is difficult to establish a robust causal relationship between financial integration and economic growth. Furthermore, there is little evidence that developing countries have been consistently successful in using financial integration to stabilize fluctuations in consumption growth. However, we do find that financial globalization can be beneficial under the right circumstances. Empirically, good institutions and quality of governance are crucial in helping developing countries derive the benefits of globalization. Similarly, macroeconomic stability appears to be an important prerequisite for ensuring that financial globalization is beneficial for developing countries. Finally, countries that employ relatively flexible exchange rate regimes and succeed in maintaining fiscal discipline are more likely to enjoy the potential growth and stabilization benefits of financial globalization.\n\nMachine-readable bibliographic record - MARC, RIS, BibTeX\n\nDocument Object Identifier (DOI): 10.3386/w10942\n\nPublished: Financial Globalization, Growth and Volatility in Developing Countries, Eswar S.

And that's okay, people need to be educated on things like this. But they won't get educated because everyone on Tumblr sees anyone like that as a threat. So they ridicule them, make fun of them, threaten them, call them names, etc. And it's not fair. Not only that, but it's pushing away people that probably would be very understanding otherwise. Because that's kind of what this is all supposed to be about???? Gaining an understanding in society that being gender fluid, transgender, pansexual, etc. is completely normal?

{"text": "Statistical and biochemical studies of the genetic code have found evidence of nonrandom patterns in the distribution of codon assignments. It has, for example, been shown that the code minimizes the effects of point mutation or mistranslation: erroneous codons are either synonymous or code for an amino acid with chemical properties very similar to those of the one that would have been present had the error not occurred. This work has suggested that the second base of codons is less efficient in this respect, by about three orders of magnitude, than the first and third bases. These results are based on the assumption that all forms of error at all bases are equally likely. We extend this work to investigate (1) the effect of weighting transition errors differently from transversion errors and (2) the effect of weighting each base differently, depending on reported mistranslation biases. We find that if the bias affects all codon positions equally, as might be expected were the code adapted to a mutational environment with transition/transversion bias, then any reasonable transition/transversion bias increases the relative efficiency of the second base by an order of magnitude. In addition, if we employ weightings to allow for biases in translation, then only 1 in every million random alternative codes generated is more efficient than the natural code. We thus conclude not only that the natural genetic code is extremely efficient at minimizing the effects of errors, but also that its structure reflects biases in these errors, as might be expected were the code the product of selection."}

{"text": "In captivity, tortoises often grow faster than their conspecifics in the wild. Here, we document growth (measured as change in body mass) in three individual Geochelone sulcata over an exceptionally long period of nearly 18 years and use growth data (measured as change in carapace length) from the literature on free-ranging animals for comparison. Body lengths almost reached a plateau in the animals due to the long observation period. After transformation of body length to body mass for data from wild animals, logistic growth curves were successfully fitted to all data. The resulting functions yielded a 1.4–2.6 times higher intrinsic growth rate in captive than in wild individuals. The logistic growth model estimated the inflexion point of the growth curve at 6–9 years for the captive animals. This coincided with age at sexual maturity, respectively observations of first egg-laying of a female and the masturbation of a male. The inflexion point of the growth curve for free-ranging individuals was estimated at 15 years. Raising tortoises on intensive feeding regimes in captivity may considerably shorten generation times during the breeding stage of restocking programmes, and slow-growing animals are more likely to thrive after release into the wild.

{"text": "There are more alternative rock bands competing for listeners' attention than ever before, and the competition for coverage from publications like ours is equally fierce. In order to stand out in this crowded arena bands need to have something special that cannot be found in their genre peers, and for our money there are few bands doing a better job of separating themselves from the herd than New Jersey seven-piece, Thank You Scientist.\n\nBoasting an elaborate and unpredictable sound, Thank You Scientist recently became the first band to sign with Evil Ink Records. The label, which was founded by Coheed And Cambria vocalist Claudio Sanchez, will release the band's new album later this year. We have the great honor of premiering a track from the record entitled \"Blue Automatic\" today, and we cannot wait for you to hear it. A concise description of the material fails us, but it's something akin to The Dear Hunter and now defunct rock band Kiss Kiss scrambled together. You can stream the song below.\n\nWhen asked about the story behind the song, Thank You Scientist told us:\n\n\"This is a quintessential TYS anthem about dealing with depression which includes, among other things, vocal injury and a near-death experience with Carbon Monoxide at our former rehearsal spot.\"\n\nStranger Heads Prevail, the upcoming Evil Ink Records from Thank You Scientist, will be released on July 29. Pre-orders are available now.\n\nThank You Scientist also recently shared a hilarious video to promote their impending album release. Watch it now:"}

He also attempted a rookie-high 73 free throws in 10 games, hitting 78.1 percent.

{"text": "One of the longest-running horror film series began with this gory shocker from director Sean S. Cunningham, who had previously produced Wes Craven's classic Last House on the Left. Entrepreneur Steve Christie (Peter Brouwer) re-opens Camp Crystal Lake after many years during which it has been cursed by murders and bad luck. The young and nubile counselors all begin to die extremely bloody deaths at the hands of an unseen killer during a rainstorm which isolates the camp. A woman is chopped in the face with an axe, another has her throat sliced in amazingly gruesome fashion, a male counselor (Harry Crosby) is pinned to a door with arrows, and a young Kevin Bacon has an arrow shoved through his throat from below a bed. Victor Miller's script is not particularly impressive, but Cunningham's tense direction, and some remarkable special-effects by acclaimed makeup artist Tom Savini are enough to make it worthwhile. 1950s quiz show regular Betsy Palmer appears as the cook whose son, Jason (Ari Lehman), drowned 25 years earlier while neglected by romancing counselors. Palmer was reportedly cast because she was willing to drive her own car to and from the set. Trivia buffs should note the decapitation scene near the end, in which the female killer exhibits rather hirsute hands clutching at the air. The hands belong to Savini's assistant, Taso N. Stavrakis. Friday the 13th made nearly 40 million dollars at the box office and spawned numerous sequels. ~ Robert Firsching, Rovi"}

Any laser removal specialists reading may want to follow these guys on Twitter and give them a call in February after the Lions and Cowboys don't win the Super Bowl.\n\nIf Dallas doesn't win it all though this year, maybe our optimistic Cowboys fan can alter that '2015' to say '1995 World Champs' and then he can show off his tattoo to any fans old enough to remember Super Bowl XXX. Neil O'Donnell probably wouldn't approve, but who cares what Neil O'Donnell thinks.\n\nBy the way, the guy swears his Cowboys tattoo is real and he's even willing to pinky promise. He also thanked his tattoo artist after putting pictures of his new ink on Twitter."}

That way, Google Translate can apply machine learning to the texts.

See, Diane Black, one of the House Republicans sponsoring a resolution complaining about President Obama's recent recess appointments, issued a press release with the following two lines:\n\nI hope the House considers my resolution as soon as we return to Washington so we can send a message to President Obama.\n\nAnd:\n\n[The NLRB appointee] names were only put forward on Dec. 15, a mere two days before the Senate recessed for the holiday.\n\nSo ... the House wasn't in town and the Senate had recessed for the holiday, but it's an outrage to the Constitution that Obama made a recess appointment, and just as soon as Diane Black gets back into town from her non-recess and Republican leadership stops blocking anything from getting done, the House is going to register its outrage over this abuse. And, while Black claims that the recess appointments are \"an affront to the Constitution ... [that] doesn't pass the smell test,\" in fact, as David Waldman notes, \"the outrage fails the old 'show me in the Constitution where it says you can't do that' test,\" since the Constitution says nothing about how long a recess has to be for recess appointments to be made.\n\nDiane Black says she wants to send a message to President Obama by passing a resolution complaining about him.

{"text": "The Red Samurai, colloquially called Reds [1], are the most feared of Renraku's elite security forces. They are listed as on par with the Tir Ghosts and other elite military units in the Sixth World. They are known for their fanaticism for the Renraku megacorporation and their advanced combat military armor which resembles ancient samurai armor.\n\nThe Red Samurai are often organized in groups of 5, with at least one spellcaster. They possess an unusually strong teamwork bond, as most squads train together over a period of one and a half years at the Forge (in Japanese, kaeteru). The squad assignments persist after graduation, and the squad becomes like a close-knit family.\n\nThe Red Samurai have a thorough genetic and racial screening process, which excludes non-humans (or relatives of non-humans). The vast majority of Red Samurai are Japanese, and most Red Samurai are male soldiers. They falsely believe that their rigorous racial purity standards bring them strength, and thus are frequently overconfident when facing non-human metahumans. An exception seems to exist with expatriate Tir elves, especially those who are mages.\n\nThe Red Samurai are woefully behind in covert ops and espionage compared to other elite military and corporate units, due to their racial homogeneity. Most Renraku covert and espionage operations are assigned to the Red Ninja or contracted out to shadowrunners. The Red Samurai excel in situations where stealth or subterfuge is not a factor.\n\nReferences Edit\n\nIndex Edit"}

Reaching everyone with clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene is a huge challenge.\n\nThat hasn't stopped us making real progress. In the last year, we've helped 374,000 people get decent toilets and 466,000 people get clean water. The Indian Government's 'Clean India' campaign has a target of no-one going to the toilet in the open by the end of 2019. Toilets are front page news and change is happening.\n\nBut while many thrive in the world's second fastest-growing economy, millions are being left behind.\n\nNearly half the population currently has no choice but to go to the toilet in rivers and fields, beside train tracks or down alleyways. Every day, at least 166 children under five die because of diarrhoea caused by dirty water and poor sanitation. It is particularly tough to get toilets and water to people living in India's rapidly expanding slums.\n\nTogether, we can make clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene a normal part of everyday life for everyone in India.\n\nWe give people the knowledge and confidence to demand their rights. We support the Government to integrate water, toilets and hygiene into health, nutrition and disaster strategies, building systems that last.\n\nAnd we make sure services meet the specific needs of women, children and disabled people so that no one is left behind."}

{"text": "Beautiful dress but it runs tall\n\nI was obsessed with the picture of this dress. The design is edgy and sexy - but formal. The dress has three layers. The first is a purple satin-type fabric. The second is a true purple, floral lace. And the third is a dark purple/black pleated tulle (beautiful). These layers give the dress a lot of body so I would not wear this if it is going to be hot or humid. I ordered the size 10 regular because the description of the dress says that the regular fits a 5'2\"-5'6\" person. This is false. I am 5'6\" and three quarters and my shoulders were still not tall enough for the top. I probably need to be at least 2 inches taller to fit into the top of this dress. The waist of the 10 fit me perfectly. The dress was also long on me. I have a 32-33\" inseam but I would have had to wear 3 inch heels in order not to trip on the dress. I'd say if you are 5'9\" you should order the regular and plan on wearing 2-3\" heels. If you have concerns about side boob or cleavage I would still try this dress. I felt that the lace offered plenty of coverage. I also thought the belt was faux leather but it is actually a heavier ribbon with a sheen. This is a very beautiful dress for the right person.

There are over 270 sculptures from such well known artists as Clement Meadmore, Anthony Caro, Beverly Pepper, Kiki Smith, George Segal and may other renowned sculptors. The grounds are described by their website as a place where art and nature are always at play. For me, as a photographer, it's a place where wedding photographers can play as well. There are a slew of compositional scenarios flowing over the vast grounds with amazing light that strikes the grounds in all different directions. Weddings at Grounds for Sculpture have an incredibly romantic feel to them, and Rats restaurant, the reception venue, is well known for their excellent cuisine. This image was taken during the portrait session of our bride and groom before the wedding ceremony at the Grounds for Sculpture, and we used this spectacular row of trees to create a sensational compositional element for this bridal portrait. It's one of my very favorite wedding venues in New Jersey, and i love when I have the opportunity to shoot there. The lens compression with my AF-S Nikkor 70-200 F2.8 VRIIG lens added to the impact of the photograph.

It is white and looks futuristic.\n\nIn his Instagram post, Musk added that this suit was not a mock-up but rather a fully functional unit. \"Already tested to double vacuum pressure,\" he wrote. \"Was incredibly hard to balance aesthetics and function. Easy to do either separately.\" (Double vacuum pressure simply means the suit was probably inflated to twice the pressure of sea level and then put into a vacuum chamber.)\n\nMusk gave no other technical information about the suit. Most strikingly, it is white, in contrast to the very blue spacesuits unveiled by Boeing in January.\n\nThese are not, strictly speaking, \"space suits.\" Rather, they are more properly flight suits designed to be worn during the ride to space and again on the ride back down to Earth. They have a limited time in which they can operate in a full vacuum and are not intended for spacewalks.\n\nBoeing and SpaceX remain in a competition to design, develop, and fly spacecraft capable of transporting astronauts to the International Space Station. Both companies have expressed confidence about completing crew test flights in 2018, but their timelines have slipped in the past and may do so again. It seems unlikely that Boeing's earlier reveal of its spacesuit indicates that it is ahead of SpaceX. Parties close to the competition have told Ars that it remains unclear which company will get to the launch pad first."}

{"text": "Machiavelli's Ethics challenges the most entrenched understandings of Machiavelli, arguing that he was a moral and political philosopher who consistently favored the rule of law over that of men, that he had a coherent theory of justice, and that he did not defend the \"Machiavellian\" maxim that the ends justify the means. By carefully reconstructing the principled foundations of his political theory, Erica Benner gives the most complete account yet of Machiavelli's thought. She argues that his difficult and puzzling style of writing owes far more to ancient Greek sources than is usually recognized, as does his chief aim: to teach readers not how to produce deceptive political appearances and rhetoric, but how to see through them. Drawing on a close reading of Greek authors--including Thucydides, Xenophon, Plato, and Plutarch--Benner identifies a powerful and neglected key to understanding Machiavelli.\n\nThis important new interpretation is based on the most comprehensive study of Machiavelli's writings to date, including a detailed examination of all of his major works: The Prince, The Discourses, The Art of War, and Florentine Histories. It helps explain why readers such as Bacon and Rousseau could see Machiavelli as a fellow moral philosopher, and how they could view The Prince as an ethical and republican text. By identifying a rigorous structure of principles behind Machiavelli's historical examples, the book should also open up fresh debates about his relationship to later philosophers, including Rousseau, Hobbes, and Kant."}

{"text": "In these days of anxiety and alienation, Thanksgiving offers the warm embrace of inclusiveness. Particularly for many people with families and faiths rooted in other lands, no other holiday, not even the Fourth of July, has so great a capacity to make them feel American.\n\nA child of Orthodox Jewish immigrants could feel his apartness on other festivals celebrated by the larger society. Christmas, Easter, Halloween — all are distinctly Christian observances, no matter how temporal and commercialized they have become. They are inevitable reminders for some Americans that they are different.\n\nThanksgiving's origins are also Christian. But it has evolved into something both secular and spiritual, a day devoted to family and amity. Perhaps that explains its unwavering appeal for believers and nonbelievers alike (even if many Native Americans understandably choose not to partake). Thanksgiving is at heart more than parades, or football or even country; there's no flag-waving or chest-thumping. It is about shared bounty and shared humanity.\n\nThat's why the writer Saadia Faruqi, a Pakistan-born Muslim, welcomes the day. \"For a Pakistani-American, Thanksgiving is as wholesome and normal a holiday as one can get,\" she said in a 2015 essay. \"It is a time to be grateful, to spend time with family, and to have a little bit of fun.\" Though she never developed a taste for turkey, Ms. Faruqi wrote, the Thanksgiving table would most definitely be set — with tandoori chicken, daal and naan."}

Earlier in the year, we reported details on a paid, ad-free subscription service that Google was planning for YouTube, and now we're getting more details on what kinds of content will be available. A new report from Bloomberg today claims that 90 percent of the content that makes up YouTube watch time has signed on for this premium service — but it sounds like the company isn't working out deals with more mainstream content providers, like the big TV networks.\n\nBloomberg says that networks like Fox, CBS, and NBC have not signed up for the program, leaving YouTube's subscription offering as something that resembles its current content mix, just without ads. That could certainly be compelling for a lot of YouTube viewers, presuming the price is right. We learned that the service would be about $10 a month; that would include no ads and offline playback — much like the company's current YouTube Music Key offering, which focuses on music videos. Additionally, it sounds like Google will jump further into the rapidly-expanding original content arena, putting itself up against offerings from Amazon, Netflix, and Hulu (among others).\n\nIt's not surprising that Google has signed up the majority of those content producers making the videos that populate YouTube — as we learned earlier, YouTube's creators are required to participate in the subscription offering or have their videos set to private.

Having heard reports about a possible announcement later this month, it's been mostly unclear on which carriers we'll see the device end up. AT&T seems like a logical home. But now Verizon? With Nokia's Lumia brand set to pass on, perhaps Nokia's 1520 will be its last hurrah before spectacularly burning out. Better that then to fade away, or so the saying goes.\n\nFound deep within the confines of China's Weibo, the picture reinforces some elements of the device's rumored design, and also some differences: 20-megapixel camera, dual-LED flash, and a potentially large display; we've been hearing it'll be 6-inch full HD, which will be made possible by Microsoft's upcoming GDR3 update for Windows Phone set to hit in (we think) October. Seeing as this device is headed to Verizon, it could be a model exclusive. Whereas AT&T got the 920, Verizon got the 928. This situation might play out in a similar fashion.\n\nWPCentral isn't too convinced by the photo's authenticity, so let's take this with the usual grain of salt. With so many Android and iOS flagships flooding the market this holiday season, a Windows Phone phablet might not be the most enticing proposition out there. But, given that Microsoft will be in control of Nokia's handset business, this will likely be one of the last Lumias we'll see."}

{"text": "SAN FRANCISCO — In Boston, the leader of a businesswomen's group said that some women were so angry about the wave of sexual harassment revelations that they no longer wanted to hire more men. In Kansas City, Mo., a women's career center is urging women not to throw caution to the wind when making public allegations involving harassment. And in Silicon Valley, one of the best-known female executives in the technology industry is celebrating the moment while advising that accusations must be followed by a fair process of punishment.\n\nThe diversity of perspectives reflects an evolving debate over harassment among women across the country. In interviews with The New York Times, most women agreed that a reckoning for the sexual misdeeds of men in the workplace was a long time coming. But ask the question \"What do we do about it?\" and the answer has become as wide ranging, nuanced and intensely personal as the offenses themselves.\n\n\"We need to make sure the people accused believe there's due process,\" Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer and one of the most prominent female executives in Silicon Valley, said in an interview. \"There will be claims that aren't true, and if people feel there's going to be no process for vetting, that's where the backlash against women comes.\"\n\nBut, Ms. Sandberg added, the opportunity to address what women commonly face cannot be allowed to slip away. Sexual harassment \"has always been about power,\" she said. \"We cannot have a rash of people coming out and people getting fired and then back to business as usual.\""}

Launching in 2008 with a gorilla design, the series began with some very low numbers and has picked up steam over the few years since. A little later than usual, the 2018 coin has started to appear at some German dealers and will no doubt spread rapidly.\n\nThe design will be instantly recognisable and we'll take a better look when actual coins become available, but there are no surprises here. An attractive series, the only changing part of the reverse face is the animal depicted at bottom left. The obverse has remained constant throughout the lifespan of the series and features the National Seal of Rwanda. The Giraffe is a good choice and there are a pair of them in attendance – an adult and a juvenile. A good-looking effort for the series, this will no doubt keep the popularity of the series high.\n\nAs usual, mintages are difficult to come by, but we've seen nothing to suggest that a figure in the 50-100,000 range isn't accurate, although we will try to confirm. A proof version with an identical specification, but struck to a higher standard, is also available again. The mintage of that one is still set at 1,000 units and it sells for around the €70.00 mark.

{"text": "I was searching for a bike to add a motor kit to and after shopping around a bit decided on this one. First of all it's BIG. I'm 6'2\" and 250 lbs so I wanted a bike that would be comfortable and this one fit the bill. Secondly, I noticed that this bike had generally good reviews. It also had the aesthetics I was looking for. It has an old school look with fenders and is all black with a white chain. I ordered the bike unassembled and built it myself. Instructions were just ok because they were generic for cruiser bikes and not specific for this model. But building it wasn't hard. Check youtube for vids on assembling cruiser bikes and you'll be fine. I took off all of the tacky stickers on the bike frame and wheels. They came off easy. Then I added a 66/80 cc engine kit to it. Note that you must replace handlebars if you plan on motorizing this bike because the handlebar tubes have a larger diameter than the throttle/handgrip diameter of most of the engine kits. Similarly, you will have to find an alternate means of mounting the fuel tank because the main tube is of a wider diameter than most bikes. After putting the motor on it, I decided I needed side view mirrors and a side-pull caliper front brake for safety because this bike only comes with a coaster brake which is insufficient for the additional speed and weight that motorizing it yields. So far I'm very happy with the quality of this bike for the price. It's exactly what I was looking for."}

{"text": "To investigate the relationship between community-level socioeconomic factors and the incidence of gang-related homicide in the city of Los Angeles. An ecological group-level analysis was conducted to correlate the 5-year incidence rates (from 1988 through 1992) of gang-related homicide with community-level socioeconomic statistics for the 18 geographically distinct Los Angeles Police Department divisions. Eight socioeconomic factors were examined: (1) log mean per capita income, (2) proportion employed, (3) proportion high school graduates, (4) proportion single-parent families, (5) proportion male, (6) proportion younger than 20 years of age, (7) proportion African American, and (8) proportion Hispanic. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for the interrelationships among the study variables and gang-related homicide. Adjusted regression estimates were calculated from a multiple linear regression model. The overall 5-year gang-related homicide rate for the city was 48.8 per 100,000, with a range of 5.2 to 173.5 per 100,000 among the different Los Angeles Police Department divisions. Pearson correlation coefficients revealed that the strongest negative correlations with gang-related homicide were log mean per capita income and proportion employed, and the strongest positive correlations were proportion single-parent families and proportion younger than 20 years of age. With mutual adjustment of all variables, only log mean per capita income and proportion employed were significantly associated with gang-related homicide. At the community level, gang-related homicide in Los Angeles is most closely associated with lower income and unemployment. These relationships may provide important insights into the causes of gang formation and gang violence."}

{"text": "JPMorgan Chase & Co. will issue chip-and-PIN credit cards this year, a deviation from the company's earlier plans to issue only chip-and-signature cards.\n\nEMV cards are commonly called chip-and-PIN because issuers around the world typically require their customers to use a PIN when making payments. When the U.S. began migrating to EMV cards, Chase was among the first to choose a chip-and-signature approach.\n\nThe adoption of chip-and-PIN will strengthen the issuer's fraud prevention, Chase Card Services CEO Eileen Serra told investors Feb. 25 at the bank's annual Investor Day presentation.\n\nFor several years, Chase has offered more than a half dozen EMV chip-and-signature credit cards, Serra says. When contacted, Chase would not elaborate on whether the chip-and-PIN cards would replace or complement the bank's current chip-and-signature products.\n\nAlthough many companies, including Visa, have defended chip-and-signature cards as easier and less expensive to deploy, others have said the chip-and-PIN approach is preferable because of the added security step of typing a PIN.\n\nBanks and retailers have shown increased interest in converting to EMV-chip cards in the wake of the massive holiday-season data breach at Target, and the retailer has chosen to fast-track its own acceptance of EMV cards.\n\nChase also told investors it would add tokenization to its new Chase Wallet services to protect shoppers making online or mobile purchases."}

{"text": "OBJECTIVE:\n\nThree groups of girls who were sexually abused (by either brothers, fathers, or stepfathers) were compared. The purpose was to identify the differing characteristics of the abuse, the family environments, and the psychosocial distress of these children.\n\nMETHOD:\n\nSeventy-two girls aged between 5 and 16 were assigned to one of the three groups. Subjects were matched between groups on the basis of their actual age. Children completed measures of traumatic stress; their mothers completed the Child Behavior Checklist-Parent Report Form (CBCL) and other self-report questionnaires on family characteristics. Workers in child protective services completed information regarding the nature and severity of the abuse.\n\nRESULTS:\n\nResults suggested few differences in the characteristics of sexual abuse between the three groups. However, penetration was much more frequent in the sibling incest group (70.8%) than in the stepfather incest (27.3%) or father incest (34.8%) groups. Ninety percent of the victims of fathers and brothers manifested clinically-significant distress on at least one measure, whereas 63.6% of stepfather victims did. Compared with father and stepfather perpetrators, brothers were raised in families with more children and more alcohol abuse.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\n\nThe authors conclude that the characteristics of brother-sister incest and its associated psychosocial distress did not differ from the characteristics of father-daughter incest These findings suggest that theoretical models and clinical practices should be adjusted accordingly and that sibling incest should not necessarily be construed as less severe or harmful than father-daughter incest."}

In particular, we'll sometimes want to confirm a 404 before removing a URL from the index, and we tend to do that faster with a 410 HTTP result code. In practice, the difference is very small, and it's not critical to use a 410 if a URL is permanently removed.

It is gas operated with fixed headspace and timing which permits rapid changing of barrels. (Associated components: mount, tripod, machine gun, 7.62mm, M122). Slightly different from its \"parent,\" the M60, the M60E3 has a receiver-attached bipod which easily deploys for stability. It has an ambidextrous safety, universal sling attachments, a carrying handle on the barrel, and a simplified gas system that does not require safety wire to prevent loosening. However, the light weight barrel is not safe for overhead fire and is not capable of sustaining a rapid rate of fire of 200 rounds per minute without catastrophic failure of the barrel.\n\n\nThe M60E3 (light weight version of the parent M60) was fielded with the intention to reduce the load carried by the gunner. However, the reduction in weight resulted in firing limitations and a loss of reliability that severely restricts the use of the weapon in the Fleet Marine Force. Consequently, troop acceptance of the E3 has been very poor. This gun will be replaced by the M240G.\n\n\nThe preferred combat ammunition mix for the M60 is a four-ball (M80) and one-tracer (M62) mix. Again, the four-and-one mix allows the gunner to use the TOT method of adjusting fire to achieve target kill."}

{"text": "In Arctic Svalbard, there is a vault that might sound like a sci-fi plot device. Completed in 2008, the Global Seed Vault is a remote archive for safeguarding seeds for thousands of crop varieties. If anything dramatic should happen elsewhere around the world, we want these seeds to be there.\n\nThe vault consists of a giant freezer room bored into a mountain, protected by the bedrock around it and the permafrost above it. But according to a report in The Guardian, the vault experienced an unhappy surprise recently—melting permafrost in winter.\n\nThe Arctic just experienced its second-warmest winter on record (surpassed only by 2016), and Svalbard saw remarkable temperatures and even rain. In fact, Svalbard averaged more than 4 °C above even the 2004-2013 average.\n\nAs a result, meltwater trickled into the seed vault's entrance tunnel before refreezing. The freezer room itself was safe, but the ice in the tunnel had to be chipped out. Hege Njaa Aschim, a spokesperson for the Norwegian government, told The Guardian, \"It was supposed to [operate] without the help of humans, but now we are watching the seed vault 24 hours a day.\"\n\nWhether or not these conditions become common as the Arctic warms, precautions are being taken to avoid a repeat of this event. Precautions include waterproofing improvements for the entrance tunnel and drainage channels to divert meltwater. It might take a little more than sticking a freezer inside an Arctic mountain to keep these seeds cold and safe, it seems."}

Hawthorn trees are beneficial to wildlife, useful for tough or exposed positions and can be used on boundaries as a deterrent.\n\nHawthorn trees are of great benefit to British wildlife, with the thorny foliage providing a protected zone. Mature Hawthorn trees can support more than 300 types of insects. Their fruits are eaten by birds, such as thrushes and waxwings (who disperse the seeds in their droppings) and small mammals. The white flowers provide a good source of nectar for bees.\n\nCrataegus is a large genus of shrubs and trees well suited to planting as ornamental trees, street trees and garden hedging. The common Crataegus monogyna has white flowers as do a number of other varieties, but there are also red and pink flowering Hawthorn trees.

The pipes ecosystem already provides a lot of them: parsers, decoders, splitters.\n\nHowever, push-based mode also has advantages. Push-based abstractions are not tied to a particular type of source because data is fed externally. And foldl folds have very useful Applicative and Comonad instances.\n\nAlso, sometimes a library will only offer a push-based interface.\n\nWouldn't it be nice if you could adapt already existing pull-based operations to work on push-based consumers?

{"text": "BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE:\n\nDiabetes mellitus is one of the most common metabolic disorders that causes micro- and macro-vascular complications. Because of additive effects of hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia for cardiovascular diseases, lipid abnormalities should be evaluated in diabetes. As vitamin C is known for its beneficial effects on serum lipids and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), we evaluated the effect of different doses of vitamin C on blood glucose, serum lipids and serum insulin in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\nMETHODS:\n\nA total of 84 patients with type 2 diabetes referred to Yazd Diabetes Research Center, Iran, were included in the study. They received randomly either 500 mg or 1000 mg daily of vitamin C for six weeks. Fasting blood sugar (FBS), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low and high density lipoprotein (LDL, HDL), glycated haemoglobin HbA(Ic) and serum insulin were measured before and after vitamin C consumption and the results were analyzed.\n\nRESULTS:\n\nA significant decrease in FBS, TG, LDL, HbA1c and serum insulin was seen in the group supplemented with 1000 mg vitamin C. The dose of 500 mg vitamin C, however, did not produce any significant change in any of the parameters studied.\n\nINTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION:\n\nOur results indicate that daily consumption of 1000 mg supplementary vitamin C may be beneficial in decreasing blood glucose and lipids in patients with type 2 diabetes and thus reducing the risk of complications."}

This program does not adequately deal with serious issues such as climate change and the impact it is having on farmers and growers around the country.\n\n\"It does not provide a genuine entry into environmental management for young people.

It's much more economical, and you can keep them fresh - they lose their flavor over time.\n\n\nIf you want larger quantities, Sams and Gordon Food Service have spices in 1 lb containers. This is how I purchase my cinnamon sticks. And while I'm on cinnamon sticks, did you know you can reuse them? Rinse them off and let them dry out again. Give them a sniff and if you smell cinnamon, use them again. You can get 3-4 uses from them anyway.\n\n\nAs for the Splenda, I did a little research and discovered that it is cheaper to purchase the box of 1000 packets at Sam's club than to use even the Walmart brand of measurable sweetener.\n\n\nVARIATIONS\n\n\nI love this chai just the way I described it.

{"text": "Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) has been used widely as a food spice and an herbal medicine. In particular, its gingerol-related components have been reported to possess antimicrobial and antifungal properties, as well as several pharmaceutical properties. However, the effective ginger constituents that inhibit the growth of oral bacteria associated with periodontitis in the human oral cavity have not been elucidated. This study revealed that the ethanol and n-hexane extracts of ginger exhibited antibacterial activities against three anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 53978, Porphyromonas endodontalis ATCC 35406 and Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611, causing periodontal diseases. Thereafter, five ginger constituents were isolated by a preparative high-performance liquid chromatographic method from the active silica-gel column chromatography fractions, elucidated their structures by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and their antibacterial activity evaluated. In conclusion, two highly alkylated gingerols, [10]-gingerol and [12]-gingerol effectively inhibited the growth of these oral pathogens at a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of 6-30 microg/mL. These ginger compounds also killed the oral pathogens at a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) range of 4-20 microg/mL, but not the other ginger compounds 5-acetoxy-[6]-gingerol, 3,5-diacetoxy-[6]-gingerdiol and galanolactone."}

{"text": "Q. Do refrigerators use more energy when filled with food?\n\nA. Not once the food gets cold. Government and commercial experts agree that the cooling section should be kept full, with enough room for some cool air to circulate for even cooling, and that the freezer compartment should be tightly packed, so the frozen foods can keep one another cold.\n\nIf there is not enough food to fill the freezer, many suggest putting in more ice trays or some containers of water. Frozen food in a fully packed freezer will survive a power failure for quite a while if the door is kept shut. Some extra water containers in the cooling section will also minimize the amount of inrushing warm air that has to be cooled when the door opens and shuts.\n\nPhoto\n\nThere are other ways to keep your refrigerator's condenser from working overtime. It is permissible to let hot food cool somewhat before refrigerating it, as long as the cooling period is not long enough to permit bacterial growth. Never use warm or hot water to make ice cubes. Cover moist food, so the refrigerator does not waste energy evaporating the moisture.\n\nCheck for the recommended temperatures, 37 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit in the cooling section and under 5 degrees Fahrenheit in the freezer compartment. Clean the condenser coils behind the refrigerator the way the manual says, and make sure there is enough room behind and above them for the warm air to escape. Make sure the door seals are tight; test them to see if they hold onto a dollar bill when you tug it.\n\nAnd most important, keep door opening to a minimum. Replace several items at a time rather than making separate trips."}

The last reported deficit was around 19 million Ausie Dollars (R180 million)\n\n(FYI – For those not quite in the know, a growing deficit means that the money received by Rugby Australia is less than the money spent by Rugby Australia, and can be likened to an overdraft. An increasing overdraft, without ever looking to be in a position to repay such overdraft, is why the Australians are introducing these cuts)\n\nAccording to reports on Sport24 this morning, the players have accepted a 23% reduction in their match fees, which previously was a mere 13 000 Aus Dollars (About R120 000).

She is pictured 2nd to my right in the flier above.  I have many ideas for my portrait of Janine.  I'm sure I will post the final product on 34hummingbird. \nMy buddy Stefan - pictured directly above me - drew my name.  He is an incredible painter and I am stoked to see what he creates.  He asked me for a few pictures of myself where I am not smiling and my teeth are not visible.  This proved to be a bit difficult to find - however I managed to scrounge up a few options for him that he states will work perfectly!\nThese portraits will be on display at Bows & Arrows 1712 L.

{"text": "Utilizing the latest generation of ICEpower® technology with a completely redesigned input stage, the mAMP is a highly efficient amplifier that delivers superior audio quality. Using dual 14AWG OFC wiring direct soldered to gold plated 5-way binding posts, the mAMP yields exceptional micro-dynamics and transparent power to your speakers.\n\nThe mAMP's input stage has been meticulously refined to optimize frequency response producing smooth upper-mid frequencies while keeping bass extension low and tight. Regardless of input type, the high quality dual differential common mode converter (derived from our DAC-2) feeds the amplifier with a pure balanced signal that isolates problematic impedance mismatches. Third generation technology significantly reduces the detrimental effects of a noisy source through balanced circuitry, audio grade capacitors, and a quad-paralleled FET buffer. While in standby, power consumption is less than 0.5w with idle power loss under 10 watts.\n\nThe mAMP's monoblock form factor allows you to use a short speaker cable for each channel by placing the amp in near proximity to each speaker, reducing the cost of speaker cable while improving the performance of your system.\n\nAn attractive anodized finish surrounds a rigid industrial design that is immune to the frequencies and vibrations generated by the various components in your HiFi system.\n\n\"These 'Little Guys' get my highest recommendation.\" - Audiophilia\n\n6moon mPRE & mAMP 100pix.jpg Wyred4Sound 100pix.jpg darko_award_2013.png asc_AWARD 100pix.jpg\n\nKimber Wire/WBT binding post upgrade:"}

Secretary of State John Kerry is said to be leading a push for a show of force, including declaring a \"no fly zone\" in northern Syria and attempting to block Russia from the area militarily.\n\nThe State Department sees that as the ultimate move to really stick it to Russia, but the Pentagon is much less upbeat about the idea, issuing a report warning about the massive amount of military resources needed to enforce a no-fly zone and warning that trying to bar Russia from parts of Syria risks \"an inadvertent clash.\"\n\nThe Pentagon's report was so negative about a military confrontation with Russia, indeed, that some officials present at the meeting accused them of \"inflating\" the cost of the operation to try to convince the White House not to pursue the scheme.\n\nPresident Obama has recently been critical of the idea of a no-fly zone, as many Republicans have advocated it, but is facing growing calls to do it anyhow, even if it isn't practical, for lack of any other real ideas on how to make a show of moving against Russia.\n\nLast 5 posts by Jason Ditz"}

{"text": "Syracuse, N.Y. — Basketball coaches, prospects and their parents often talk growth potential when projecting into the performance future.\n\nThe website Draftexpress.com has gathered the measurements of 56 prospects who participated in the training camps of USA Basketball's U17 and U18 teams and posted them on their site. The interesting thing is that because plenty of these players have a history with USA Basketball, it's possible to watch their incremental growth (and yes, project whether they could get even bigger).\n\nSeveral Syracuse recruits and prospects are on that list. Here's a breakdown:\n\nThe information on Malachi Richardson is curious. According to the posted measurements, he's two inches shorter than he was last year. Clearly, some sort of mistake has been made along the way. USA Basketball supposedly measured him at 6-foot-3 1/4 in shoes; he also allegedly has a 7-foot wingspan. Richardson has gained six pounds over the summer.\n\nTyler Lydon has grown almost an inch from last year (to 6-8.75 without shoes). He's gained 13 pounds since last summer (to a still-slender 194).\n\nThomas Bryant measured 6-9 and weighed 241 pounds, 20 pounds more than he weighed in the spring. He had a 7-foot-5.5 wingspan.\n\nV.J. King, whom Syracuse recently offered a scholarship, measured 6-5 (without shoes), but had a remarkable 7-foot wingspan. And Tyus Battle, a player Syracuse coaches covet, has grown two inches in two years and stands nearly 6-7 in shoes."}

{"text": "System D Game Boy Light [ Edit ] [ Talk ]\n\nThe Game Boy Light is a backlit and updated version of the Game Boy Pocket exclusively released in Japan. It was first sold in stores on April 14, 1998.\n\nThe Game Boy Light only lasted a short amount of time before the Game Boy Color was released in October and November of 1998. The Game Boy Light looks much like a taller Game Boy Pocket, however the battery compartment is shaped differently and is much larger than that of the Game Boy Pocket. The battery compatment was designed this way to accommodate for the two AA batteries that the system utilized, unlike the two AAA batteries of the Game Boy Pocket. It is also believed that this was to allow for a more comfortable grip on the system. The most probable reason for the switch to AA batteries was to power the extra electroluminescent backlight, however it could also be justified by the extra battery life that AA batteries provide over AAAs. It was the only officially released Game Boy to have a backlit screen until 2005 when the backlit version of the Game Boy Advance SP was released.\n\nAt launch, the Game Boy Light was only available in the colors gold and silver, but was later available in translucent yellow (Toys \"R\" Us), translucent red (Tezuka Osamu World Shop), and transparent (Astro Boy & Famitsu) as special, limited editions. A very limited \"Pikachu\" version model was later released at Pokémon Center Tokyo for a very limited time and an estimate of 1000 of these units were produced according to Nintendo. These special/limited editions are highly valued, especially in mint condition."}

Poverty ratio is the highest for Muslims, at 33.9 per cent, in urban areas. Further, poverty in rural areas declined at a faster pace than in urban cities between 2004-05 and 2009-10."}

The surplus of cars consists of a Garnet Red Tintcoat Camaro SS, what appears to be a gloss Black Camaro SS and a Silver Ice Metallic Camaro RS sans the stripe.If anything, the 20-inch black-painted aluminum 5-spoke wheels look better than the silver or gray-painted alloys. There's another photograph portraying two RS units and an SS sandwiched between a 2015 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 and a 2016 Cadillac ATS-V, the platform brother of the #CamaroSix.Looking atand sixth-gen side by side is somewhat strange at first glance. The exterior differences between the two generations are subtle, yet there's no hiding the fact the 2016 Camaro is a wee bit smaller than its honorable predecessor in ZL1 format.Then comes a set of pics of a Bright Yellow SS.

The Rambus snapper is that tiny one on the far left.\n\nThe potential for such a device is huge - it could mean a virtually undetectable camera in every powered device, ideal for the Internet of Things. A user could walk around the house gesture controlling everything once these cameras become smart enough to recognise movements.\n\nBack in the now this Rambus camera works like no other snapper. Current cameras focus light onto a sensor to re-create the image digitally on a screen. Rambus uses a grating etched with a spiral pattern which lets light enter from every orientation. The sensor is able to collect a jumble of spirals that can be translated into an image by software. Before the translation process the image would be a blur to the human eye. Scroll through the software rendering stages below to see how the image becomes clear.\n\nAs you can see the final image isn't exactly a threat to current cameras, with just a 128 x 128 resolution. But the idea of every object having a basic level of visual awareness is hugely exciting.

The Egyptian authorities concluded that the group had received crucial advice from two policemen, Lt. Mohamed Eweis and Col. Sameh el-Azizi, who were among a series of military and security officers the group eventually recruited.\n\nNow the same group, operating as the Sinai Province of the Islamic State, is the prime suspect in yet another inside job: The bombing of the Russian charter jet that exploded last week in midair over the desert north of Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, which killed all 224 people aboard. British and American officials say they believe it increasingly likely that the group planted the bomb before takeoff.\n\nNo government has confirmed that the Sinai Province has taken responsibility. But the group has eagerly claimed it and others in the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, have celebrated — positions that reflect drastic changes in both the Islamic State and the Sinai Province since the Egyptian unit first pledged its allegiance one year ago. Attacks by the Sinai Province, previously a mostly Bedouin group that focused mainly on fighting the Egyptian security forces, have quickly grown in sophistication and bloodshed. If its role in bringing down the plane is confirmed, the Sinai Province may have even momentarily surprised and surpassed its vicious parent, and, some analysts said, risked a broad backlash against the Islamic State itself."}

It is the myth that stimulants have a paradoxical effect on children with ADHD. Or, stated another way, it is the myth that stimulants cause hyperactivity and inattention in \"normal\" children but have the opposite effect in children in ADHD.\n\nThis is a myth that parents like to hear, as it serves as a confirmation of their child's diagnosis -- after all, according to the myth, only children with ADHD show an improvement when given stimulants. Unfortunately, this myth is untrue.\n\nWhat Is a Paradoxical Effect? Medically speaking, a paradoxical effect is a reaction to a drug or other treatment that is the opposite of what is normally expected. For instance, sedating antihistamines (like ®) typically cause drowsiness for most people. However, for some individuals, particularly young children, a paradoxical reaction may occur and the drug can cause excitation.

Surveying and analyzing these various texts and artifacts, Christopher Faraone reveals that gender is the crucial factor in understanding love spells. There are, he argues, two distinct types of love magic: the curselike charms used primarily by men to torture unwilling women with fiery and maddening passion until they surrender sexually; and the binding spells and debilitating potions generally used by women to sedate angry or philandering husbands and make them more affectionate.\n\n\nFaraone's lucid analysis of these spells also yields a number of insights about the construction of gender in antiquity, for example, the \"femininity\" of socially inferior males and the \"maleness\" of autonomous prostitutes. Most significantly, his findings challenge the widespread modern view that all Greek men considered women to be naturally lascivious. Faraone reveals the existence of an alternate male understanding of the female as \"naturally\" moderate and chaste, who uses love magic to pacify and control the \"naturally\" angry and passionate male. This fascinating study of magical practices and their implications for perceptions of male and female sexuality offers an unusual look at ancient Greek religion and society."}

In July, it was 22 percent, then 18 percent in August and 19 percent in September. It finally dropped to 14 percent in October.\n\nBut this time around, the voters who backed Bernie Sanders in the primaries are moving over to Hillary Clinton at a much more rapid pace.\n\nLast month, 20 percent of Sanders supporters said they would back Trump over Clinton in the general election. This month, that figure is down to 8 percent.\n\nThe reasons for this significant difference are many. In 2008, Clinton was regarded as the more moderate candidate on the Democratic side. The press also described McCain as a moderate, though significantly to the right of Clinton. Apart from the warning sign of his selection of Sarah Palin as as his vice presidential running mate, the idea of a McCain presidency struck few people as a call to toss the nation over a cliff.

{"text": "Investigators say a man set a Penn Hills house on fire after an argument with the home's residents.\n\nMark Anthony Venson, 21, turned himself in to police Saturday to face charges for arson. Investigators say he intentionally set fire to the house on Lime Hollow Road on Thursday after the home's residents told him to leave.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a criminal complaint, Venson does not live in the house, but the couple that lives there had allowed him to sleep in the home from time to time because he had been homeless. Last week, Venson allegedly started behaving strangely, including walking into the couple's bedroom multiple times on Wednesday before finally being told to leave.\n\nOn Thursday night, the couple told police they were upstairs in their bedroom when the smelled something cooking. They say Venson and a friend had let themselves into the house unannounced and cooked all of their sausage.\n\nInvestigators say the residents became angry and told Venson to leave, but he refused. After 10 minutes of arguing, the residents called police. Venson then agreed to go, but first went into the basement.\n\nPolice say Venson came back upstairs when officers arrived. They took his information and allowed him to go, but soon noticed smoke was pouring out of the duplex. The female resident was overcome by the smoke, and had to be dragged out by police.\n\nArson investigators determined the fire was set intentionally in the basement, and that Venson was likely responsible. Police worked with Venson's family, and he surrendered at the Penn Hills Police Department on Saturday. His bail was set at $1,000 and he faces a preliminary hearing on Jan. 27.\n\nAlertMe"}
{"text": "Earth's global thaw has reached Mount Everest, the world's tallest peak, researchers said Tuesday at the Meeting of the Americas in Cancun, Mexico.\n\nGlaciers in the Mount Everest region have shrunk by 13 percent in the last 50 years and the snowline has shifted upward by 590 feet, Sudeep Thakuri, a graduate student at the University of Milan in Italy, said in a statement. Located in the Himalaya Mountains on the border between China and Nepal, Everest's summit is 29,029 feet above sea level.\n\nThakuri and his colleagues tracked changes to glaciers, temperatures and precipitation at Everest and the surrounding Sagarmatha National Park. There, glaciers have retreated an average of 1,300 feet since 1962, the team found. More recently, precipitation (both snow and rain) has dropped by 3.9 inches and temperatures have risen 1 degree Fahrenheit since 1992.\n\nThe researchers suspect that the glacial melting in the Everest region is due to global warming, but they have not yet established a firm connection between the mountains' changes and climate change, Thakuri said in the statement.\n\nWhile Everest isn't the only Himalayan region seeing the effects of climate change, not all of the region's glaciers are melting. The Karakoram Mountains, on the China-India-Pakistan border, are holding steady and may even be growing. But shrinking glaciers in the rest of the Himalayas have drawn significant global attention, because the glaciers provide water and power for roughly 1.5 billion people.\n\nCopyright 2013 LiveScience, a TechMediaNetwork company.

Until Mitt Romney releases his tax returns, Americans will continue to wonder what he's hiding. Romney seems to think he plays by a different set of rules than every other presidential candidate for the last thirty years, all of whom lived up to the standard of transparency set by Mitt Romney's father and released their tax returns,\" Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson told Buzzfeed in a statement Thursday.\n\nThe comments came in response to Romney's statement earlier in the day Thursday in which he said he has paid at least 13 percent in taxes for the last 10 years and took at shot at the Democratic leader.\n\n\"I paid taxes every single year. Harry Reid's charge is totally false. I'm sure waiting for Harry to put up who it was that told him what he says they told him. I don't believe it for a minute,\" Romney told reporters.\n\nReid late last month claimed an unidentified investor in Romney's former company Bain had informed him the reason the GOP presidential hopeful had not released more than two years worth of tax returns was because he had not in fact paid taxes for years.\n\nReid's claim angered the Romney campaign, which has vehemently denounced it as false for weeks. But Reid's statement also forced the issue back to the forefront of the campaign, derailing attempts by Republicans to return the focus to President Barack Obama's record and to the economy generally."}

The majority of Cubans support Castro (the lowest estimate I have seen is 50 percent). 2. There is no effective political opposition. 3. Fidel Castro and other members of the Cuban Government espouse or condone communist influence. 4. Communist influence is pervading the Government and the body politic at an amazingly fast rate. 5. Militant opposition to Castro from without Cuba would only serve his and the communist cause. 6. The only foreseeable means of alienating internal support is through disenchantment and disaffection based on economic dissatisfaction and hardship.\n\nIf the above are accepted or cannot be successfully countered, it follows that every possible means should be undertaken promptly to weaken the economic life of Cuba. If such a policy is adopted, it should be the result of a positive decision which would call forth a line of action which, while as adroit and inconspicuous as possible, makes the greatest inroads in denying money and supplies to Cuba, to decrease monetary and real wages, to bring about hunger, desperation and overthrow of government.\n\nThe principal item in our economic quiver would be flexible authority in the sugar legislation. This needs to be sought urgently. All other avenues should likewise be explored. But first, a decision is [Page 886]necessary as to the line of our conduct. Would you wish to have such a proposal prepared for the Secretary?2"}

{"text": "From the NY Times, excerpt \"Falser Words Were Never Spoken.\"\n\n\n…Gandhi's words have been tweaked a little too much in recent years. Perhaps you've noticed a bumper sticker that purports to quote him: \"Be the change you wish to see in the world.\" When you first come across it, this does sound like something Gandhi would have said. But when you think about it a little, it starts to sound more like … a bumper sticker. Displayed brightly on the back of a Prius, it suggests that your responsibilities begin and end with your own behavior. It's apolitical, and a little smug.\n\nSure enough, it turns out there is no reliable documentary evidence for the quotation. The closest verifiable remark we have from Gandhi is this:\n\n\"If we could change ourselves, the tendencies in the world would also change. As a man changes his own nature, so does the attitude of the world change towards him. … We need not wait to see what others do.\"\n\nHere, Gandhi is telling us that personal and social transformation go hand in hand, but there is no suggestion in his words that personal transformation is enough. In fact, for Gandhi, the struggle to bring about a better world involved not only stringent self-denial and rigorous adherence to the philosophy of nonviolence; it also involved a steady awareness that one person, alone, can't change anything, an awareness that unjust authority can be overturned only by great numbers of people working together with discipline and persistence.\n\nWhen you start to become aware of these bogus quotations, you can't stop finding them…\"\n\n~\n\nBonus: Gandhi: how to be an effective Activist."}

{"text": "Charting the Economy assesses the course of Malaya's commodity-dependent economy during the first 40 years of the 20th century under British colonial control, contrasting it with economic growth and development in contemporary Malaysia.\n\nDrawing on archival documents to derive estimates of Malaya's GDP and analysing trends, it breaks new ground in understanding the dynamics of economic performance.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, most of the Malay Peninsula, like much of Southeast Asia, was under colonial rule. Colonialism facilitated the control of lands, institutions and peoples, as well as the exploitation of natural resources.\n\nMalaya's economy was largely agrarian, supported by two primary commodity pillars - tin and rubber - produced to meet the needs of the industries and people in Europe and North America.\n\nSultan Nazrin Shah eloquently articulates how the economy rode a commodity roller-coaster. Being small and open, it was exceedingly vulnerable to external shocks - World War I 1914-1929, the Roaring Twenties 1920-1929, and the Great Depression 1929-1932 - which were the main causes of economic booms and busts.\n\nThis book makes a compelling case that the colonial laissez-faire economic system worked well for the agency houses that repatriated huge profits but paid small dividends to the masses. Development was highly uneven, with growth and prosperity concentrated in and benefiting the Peninsula's west coast states, where most of the tin mines and rubber plantations were located.\n\nAfter independence, national control over economic management was accompanied by a long-term vision for a socially just nation. Real GDP growth in post-independence Malaysia brought rapid advances in standards of living."}
{"text": "If you have toothpicks, you can use these to pick off larger pieces of corrosion from the springs.\n\nIf you have electrical tape, cut it into small squares and cover openings to the circuits inside to prevent water from getting inside. Dip the q-tips into the solution and start scrubbing. They are not sturdy when wet so you will need a lot of them. I find it useful to clean with one end of the q-tip and dry with the other; after all, you don't want to get the electronics wet inside. That is why q-tips are good since they can't hold enough water to really drench things. In between scrubs, you can use a toothpick to get off more loosened gunk.\n\nIf you have the leeway, use the paper towels. They are larger and slightly more abrasive than the q-tips. Be ABSOLUTELY sure that they are not soaking wet as you do not want to get the delicate circuits inside wet (yet another reason to use electrical tape). Repeating what you did before, scrub off the the corrosive chemicals and dry. You may hear fizzing as your solution reacts with the leaked chemicals.\n\nYou need not be perfect with your cleaning. You only need the parts of the metal that touch the nodes of the battery to be clear enough to conduct electricity. The metal underneath the corroded area will still conduct just fine.\n\n**Be careful not to touch your face, eyes, mouth, nose, etc... as some of these chemicals are very caustic!

The same Matt Frattin that we just can't quit, is still with the Marlies.\n\nSo, what's going on? Is this like that episode of Seinfeld where George shows up for work in the hopes everyone will just forget that he quit the day before?\n\nNot quite; Matt Frattin is still technically an Ottawa Senator, but the organization has loaned him back to the Marlies, as teams are allowed to do. His NHL rights remain with Ottawa, but as long as he's in the AHL, at least for the foreseeable future, he'll remain in Toronto.\n\nThe details of this bizarre transaction- such as who is actually paying him, and how long the loan will last- are unclear at this point. My guess is given Frattin's one-way contract of $850,000, the Leafs have agreed to pay at least something. As for how long, it wouldn't surprise me if Frattin spent the balance of the season with the Marlies. He's been a key contributor all season, and the Sens' AHL affiliate in Binghamton is, to put it kindly, not going anywhere fast.\n\nThis, if nothing else, is an interesting paper transaction to the Phaneuf deal. The Leafs give up an SPC, but keep the player on their AHL roster, possibly for the balance of the season."}

Speaking in the Red Sox clubhouse before the series opener against the Yankees, Crawford said he was signing autographs pregame when the fan called him a \"Monday.\" This is a less familiar racial epithet, one many people might not know as a derogatory term.

{"text": "The Sidi Way Rain boot is part of a \"Europe direct\" closeout deal we scored on Sidi boots. This model is no longer available in the US, but is sold elsewhere in the world. This boot is a great option for those looking for a comfortable, lightweight water resistant street boot. When I put these on, I immediately liked the feel. The interior has just a slight bit of thickness to the lining that makes them really comfortable right from the start. Most of the boot's outer shell is Lorica—a man made material that is flexible, durable and abrasion resistant, and there are also some textile fabric inserts. This makes for a very lightweight boot. For protection, there are circular armor pads at the inside and the outside of the ankle bones (hidden from view). There is also an armor piece in the shin area. The toe box and heel cup are reinforced as well. This boot is billed as \"water resistant\" by Sidi. The construction of the boot appears to be like any other Sidi waterproof style, so I'm not sure what the significance of the \"resistant\" designation means nor could I get a good answer from the distributor, but let's all just think of them as \"resistant\" and be happy! Take the \"View Larger Images\" link above to view close-up pictures of the sole and waterproof closure and and all the other features of the boot. We listed this boot with a $200 MSRP, because that was the MSRP a few years back, but consider that this boot would have an MSRP of more like $225 these days like the current Tour Rain boot. From that perspective this Way Rain is even a better bargain! :: Paul, 06-26-13"}

{"text": "Using data from across the Stripe network, we've developed a machine learning system that evaluates charges in real-time and blocks those that are almost certainly fraudulent. By analyzing hundreds of different characteristics pertaining to each payment, these algorithms have already shielded businesses on Stripe from millions of attempted fraudulent charges.\n\nStarting today, you can help improve these models. By letting us know when we've missed a charge that you believe to be fraudulent, or declined one that you think is legitimate, you can help train a model that's optimized for your business. This ensures that the protection you receive will get better over time.\n\nIn practice, it's very simple. In the dashboard, you can now:\n\nReport and refund charges you believe to be fraudulent—just follow the \"Report fraudulent payment\" link when viewing a charge.\n\nMark as safe charges that Stripe blocked as suspected fraud. Charges we believe to be fraudulent will appear with a status of \"Blocked\" in the payments list and have a prominent message on the payment detail page. If you mark one of these charges as safe, you can retry it—we will not attempt to block it again.\n\nThere's also equivalent functionality available in the API—check out the documentation for more details.\n\nOver time, businesses on Stripe should not have to think about fraud and disputes. By enabling this feedback loop—between you and other businesses built on Stripe on the one hand, and our fraud detection infrastructure on the other—we're confident that we'll be able to deliver significant improvements in the future.\n\nIf you have any feedback or suggestions on these tools, or other thoughts about how we could better help you block fraud, please drop me a line."}

Great City will be built around a high-rise core housing 80,000 people, entirely walkable, and surrounded by green space.\n\nPlanned for a rural area outside Chengdu, the high-density Great City will give residents access to a 'buffer area' of gardens and greenery making up 60% of the total area of the city. Walking from the center of the city to the green spaces takes just ten minutes, and other nearby urban centers will be accessible by a mass transit system.\n\nChicago architecture firm Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture say the city will use 48% less energy and 58% less water than a more conventional city of the same size; it will also produce 89% less landfill waste and generate 60% less carbon dioxide.\n\nThe development addresses the problem of overpopulation, pollution and urban sprawl by compacting a lot of residents into vertical housing, growing food nearby. \"The design is attempting to address some of the most pressing urban issues of our time, including the need for sustainable, dense urban living at a cost people can afford,\" says Gill.\n\n\"Accordingly, we've designed this project as a dense vertical city that acknowledges and in fact embraces the surrounding landscape—a city whose residents will live in harmony with nature rather than in opposition to it. Great City will demonstrate that high-density living doesn't have to be polluted and alienated from nature. Everything within the built environment of Great City is considered to enhance the quality of life of its residents. Quite simply, it offers a great place to live, work and raise a family.\""}

This was because the death of Kurt Cobain was still weighing heavily on people's minds while the Hungerford killings were not; Thom chose to change the lyrics so that no one would think the song was about the late Nirvana leader. \"Sulk\" is rarely heard live: the band played it in concert a few times in 1994, even less often in 1995, and never again after that."}

Completing such a filing, he continued, would be a \"waste of time.\" He was supposed to file his current financial information on May 15, but was granted an extension.\n\nDuring the primaries, Sanders called for \"complete transparency regarding the funding of campaigns.\" Now, says NBC News, \"in the teeth of a Democratic primary where Sanders posed a bona fide threat to Clinton, voters couldn't definitively know whether Sanders — historically one of the Senate's least wealthy members — suddenly parlayed his political fame into personal profit. Or, for that matter, whether he sustained financial distress. The form Sanders didn't file would have detailed his finances through the middle of May 2016.\"\n\nThere's a reason Sanders hasn't turned in his paperwork: like all good socialists, he gets touchy about his own finances. And he games the system.\n\nThis week, Sanders tweeted, \"To my Republican colleagues: If you don't have the guts to defend your ideas in a free election, get another job.\" To which I quickly responded, \"You endorsed Hillary and then bought a vacation home, socialist hero.\"\n\nBut socialists never take responsibility for their own personal economics, their campaign economics, or their economic policies.

Every time I see one I want to leave the office, get in my car and drive straight into Eyjafjallajökull.

We're still working on the numbers required for each level but we should have it sorted out before the citadel release.\" The change will be a boon to many of the good guys, who have a solid complement of posters and /r/eve veterans.

When communion was passed to Trump, wife Melania, and two staffers in attendance, the GOP front-runner briefly mistook it for the offering plate and grabbed a number of bills from his pocket, according to AP.\n\n\"I thought it was for offering,\" he said with a chuckle to his staff, AP reports.\n\nNo harm done, though, as Trump later made a donation when the time came a few minutes later in the service.\n\nEvangelicals have long been critical in Iowa's GOP caucuses, and as The Washington Post notes, Trump's efforts to court them haven't always gone swimmingly:\n\n\"Trump has made several efforts to woo evangelicals, including a recent visit to Liberty University in Virginia. There he was made fun of after he cited a Bible verse as being from \"Two Corinthians\" instead of \"Second Corinthians.\" (Using \"Two Corinthians\" is common in Britain, and his mother is from Scotland.)\"\n\nAs Trump left Sunday's service, AP notes that the church's pastor offered him a prayer \"that Jesus would guide his decisions.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Trump said. \"I need that.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1STvF3f"}

Play as Ash the Ember Knight, cannon-wielding specialist Dead Eye the Tainted or crafty hero explosives specialist Samson III in teams of four to scout for power-ups and create an effective (and deadly) defensive perimeter. Fight alone or alongside soldiers with distinct abilities to withstand the might of the demon horde across a number of thematic maps – each with its unique environmental twist. Set up archers, catapults, and mages – and carefully choose where to place them for maximum defensive cover. However, defending only goes so far: The demon army waits for no man and will ruthlessly attack from all angles! Vanquish demons with powerful weapons, unmatched hero skills, and giant gargoyles!\n\nLooks like another title to put on the watch list. I love when games take certain genres and blend them together, with the co-op support this could be a lot of fun to play with friends.\n\nThanks for the tip crt0mega!"}

{"text": "Differences between Parchment, Vellum and Paper\n\nThe term parchment is a general term for an animal skin which has been prepared for writing or printing. Parchment has been made for centuries, and is usually calf, goat, or sheep skin. The term vellum from the French veau refers to a parchment made from calf skin. The manufacture of parchment is quite involved. After the skin is removed from the animal and any hair or flesh is cleaned away, it is stretched on a wooden frame. While it is stretched, the parchment maker or parchminer scrapes the surface of the skin with a special curved knife. In order to create tension in the skin, scraping is alternated by wetting and drying the skin. The parchment is scraped, wetted, and dried several times to bring it to the right thickness and tautness. Sometimes a final finish is achieved using pumice as an abrasive followed by chalk in order to prepare the surface of the skin to accept ink.\n\nParchment has traditionally been used instead of paper for important documents such as religious texts, public laws, indentures, and land records as it has always been considered a strong and stable material. The five pages of the U.S. Constitution as well as the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, and the Articles of Confederation are written on parchment.\n\nThe terms parchment and vellum are also used in the paper making industry. Parchment paper is made from cellulose fibers prepared from fir trees or plants such as cotton or flax. Paper can be made which mimics the thickness and smooth surface of parchment. The terms refer to the finish of the paper and should not be relied upon as an indicator of its long term stability."}

{"text": "Follow Jeff Add to circle\n\n\nTurbo lag is a defining characteristic of older forced-induction cars. These large turbochargers were used to feed high-performance engines and generate significant power. The problem would come when you called upon that power. Your right foot mashes the gas—then nothing. A shock of power would eventually make its way to the drive wheels, sometimes mid-corner. Turbo lag is notoriously finicky (and in the case of old race cars, a killer) and automakers have been working on ways to reduce or eliminate it. Volvo has its own solution and it involves a bit of engineering that we need explained.\n\nThe system is called Power Pulse, and it works with the help of an air compressor and an electric motor. The motor waits for the driver to ask for more power, and it keeps the air compressor tank ready to go with clean air pulled in from the intake. When the throttle is pressed, the air tank can then force compressed air into the exhaust manifold and send it along with the exhaust gases to spool up the turbo.\n\nThis is almost similar to what the Fast and Furious crew would be doing when they hit their \"nitrous\" button. They want to force more air into the engine, and here Volvo is forcing more air into the exhaust manifold to get the turbo up to speed more quickly. There's no need for bottles of NOS though, as the air compressor seems suited to handle the task.\n\nOnce the turbo has spooled up, the air compressor's job is done. Now the electric motor refills the tank so the Power Pulse system is ready to help out the next time it's needed.\n\n_______________________________________\n\nFollow Motor Authority on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube."}

Pescetarians, as they are commonly referred, had a 43% lower chance of getting the cancer compared to people with omnivorous diets.\n\nWhy focus on colorectal cancer? It is the third most diagnosed cancer, and the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the US in 2014, according to American Cancer Society statistics. The disease is particularly dangerous because it is usually asymptomatic in its early stages, making it more difficult to detect when it's less deadly. Only 59% of those recommended for screenings receive procedures that are in line with the American Cancer Society's standards\n\nYet another study from last year found an average weight loss of nearly 7.5 pounds for vegetarians.\n\nWhile evidence shows the health benefits of reducing red meat consumption, the recent study highlights the differences between even a fully vegetarian diet and a pescetarian diet. Within the sample group there was a 27% drop in the risk of contracting colorectal cancer if you switch from fully vegetarian to eating fish. The authors of the study suggest that omega-3 fatty acids may be the key to such a low risk of cancer in the pescetarian group.\n\nRead More"}

But I will promise you that whatever you will do will be even quicker and dirtier.\n\nWhat WAR does is give you a framework, and makes it very easy for everyone to have their own implementation. Don't like what you see? Well, you are being given a systematic, consistent framework to which you can build your own house. Go ahead and do it, and give us an open house to look at it.\n\nOr, complain that somehow these free WAR homes are not good enough and… well… keep wandering the streets with nowhere to sleep.

Dick's alt-history novel about life in the former United States after the Allied Powers lost World War II.\n\nHe'll play the mysterious figure tied to the Resistance movement who collects the enigmatic films that seem to depict alternate versions of reality — the ones the Japanese and Nazis want to find and destroy. Watch a clip of his character above.\n\nSeason 2, which starts streaming December 16, picks up with political tensions mounting between Germany and Japan. Juliana Crain (Alexa Davalos) facing the consequences of her decision to betray the Resistance and allow Joe Blake (Luke Kleintank), a suspected Nazi agent, to escape the Pacific States with a film originally bound for the Man in the High Castle. Joe returns a hero to the Reich and finds himself thrust into the Nazi capital of Berlin, face to face with the father who abandoned him. Meanwhile, Frank Frink (Rupert Evans) becomes increasingly radicalized and drawn further into the Resistance after seeing images of his own execution in the mysterious films. DJ Qualls, Joel de la Fuente, Brennan Brown, Bella Heathcote, Callum Keith Rennie, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and Rufus Sewell co-star.\n\nVeteran actor Root has appeared in dozens of films as Selma, Trumbo, Boardwalk Empire and Finding Dory and played Milton in the cult classic Office Space.

It'll certainly be more affordable, as well. Amazon already has a small dongle-like piece of hardware in the existing Fire TV Stick, but it doesn't support 4K playback.\n\nAnother product that's a much more of a longshot is a pair of Alexa-enabled \"smart glasses\" -- like Google Glass, but without a screen and with a much more subtle, standard design that is said to resemble a normal pair of eyeglasses. There hasn't been much of a consumer market for such a device, though many companies appeared to be scared away after Glass was such a notable flop.\n\nFinally, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman expects to see an updated Echo speaker that sounds significantly better than the existing model. That would be key to compete with Apple's HomePod, which sounds great but doesn't have nearly the voice-activated ecosystem that the Echo and Alexa currently provide. With this new speaker, you'd theoretically not have to choice between the Echo's proven voice smarts and the HomePod's excellent audio quality. Gurman also believes that Amazon is working on a home security system to compete with Nest Secure, which was just announced last week.\n\nBoth the Fire TV streaming box and Echo speaker (in black only) are currently unavailable on Amazon. That might not mean anything, but it could also be a hint that these products are about to be replaced. Either way, we'll have the news for you this afternoon -- Amazon isn't offering a livestream of the event, but we'll be at the company's headquarters to deliver all the details."}

The news of Flynn Jr.'s inclusion in the Russia probe comes one day after House Democrats sent a letter to Mueller raising concern about the former national security adviser's failure to disclose a 2015 trip to the Middle East, where Flynn senior may have lobbied on behalf of a foreign government to strike a deal to build a nuclear reactors program.\n\n\"The American people deserve to know whether General Flynn was secretly promoting the private interests of these businesses while he was a campaign adviser, a transition official, or President Trump's National Security Adviser,\" said the letter, signed by Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) and Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY.).\n\nIn February, Flynn was fired as national security adviser after reports surfaced that he lied to Vice President Mike Pence about conversations he had had with the Russian ambassador, making him vulnerable to possible Russian blackmail.\n\nFlynn Jr. remains active in attacking Clinton on social media. In recent days, he has retweeted several criticisms of Clinton and her new memoir, What Happened. He has yet to make a comment on being a subject of Mueller's federal inquiry."}

Were Iranian agents, professional killers, already in place in the UK when the fatwa was proclaimed? Might a \"freelancer\", stirred by a denunciation in a mosque, be an effective assassin? The media excitement was so intense that it was hard to think straight.\n\nHundreds dead in riots, an editor killed, a publisher shot, a translator stabbed and books burned from Bolton to Islamabad. Sometimes it's easy to forget the fatwa's human cost among the wry anecdotes of clandestine dinner parties and Special Branch minders.\n\nRushdie's still not sure if the struggle over The Satanic Verses has produced a clear winner, explaining to Stuart Jeffries in 2012 that \"the book is still in print and the author wasn't suppressed so it was a victory in that sense. But the fear and menaces have grown.\"\n\nTwenty-five years on, Rushdie says he's a \"level three or four\" risk now, even though the fatwa against him still appears to be in force. In the week where Penguin India withdrew Wendy Doniger's The Hindus from circulation, the anniversary reminds us that fear and menaces surround any writer who dares to \"provoke the imagination\"."}

But the real number of such cases is believed to be much bigger.\n\nIn the country of 19.5 million people, many cases of domestic violence cases go unreported due to feelings of shame and because victims are frightened of their attackers.\n\nThe government has failed to provide women with appropriate legal and institutional tools to fight back against such abuse, experts say.\n\nPolice generally do not intervene in domestic disputes, for example, and tend to investigate only if the victim files a complaint.

They sought a return to the glory days of communism and the elimination of corporate and capitalist influence, particularly in orbital facilities and offworld colonies throughout the Sol system. This culminated in the Interplanetary War, which resulted in the faction's eventual defeat by the newly-formed United Nations Space Command.[1]\n\nOrganizational history [ edit ]\n\nAs multinational entities like the United Nations spread capitalism across newly-colonized territories in the Solar System, the mid-2100's saw a rebirth of communism with largely the same goals as its old nineteenth and twentieth-century advocates. The Koslovics, a revolutionary group of rebels began orchestrating attacks against their opponents on the far-right, the Jovian-based fascist Frieden, followed by a bloody struggle in South America during the Rain Forest Wars, and ending with a last stand on Mars during the Argyre Planitia Campaign where UNSC infantry spearheaded a decisive, fatal blow to their encampments. Subsequently, the remaining Koslovic forces throughout the system were systematically destroyed by the UNSC during the Interplanetary War between 2164 and 2170,[1] and they formally surrendered to the UNSC in 2170 with the Callisto Treaty.\n\nList of appearances [ edit ]"}

{"text": "Although nerve growth factor plays a role in augmenting sodium channel expression in small dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells, the cytochemical mediators responsible for enhanced expression in large DRG neurons are unknown. To narrow the search for mediators involved in the increased production of sodium channels in large DRG neurons, we examined the effect of cyclooxygenase inhibition on sodium channel production during inflammation. Thirty minutes before the subcutaneous injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), rats received ibuprofen (nonselective, cyclooxygenase inhibitor), NS-398 (selective, cyclooxygenase inhibitor), or vehicle. Withdrawal thresholds from thermal and mechanical stimulation were measured before and immediately after CFA injection and at selected hourly intervals after injection for the next 24 hours. Sodium channel up-regulation was then examined in DRG by using site-specific, anti–sodium channel antibodies, Na v 1.7 and 1.8. Both ibuprofen and NS-398 provided analgesia during the second phase of inflammatory hyperalgesia that begins 3 hours after CFA injection. The up-regulation, predominantly of Na v 1.7 and minimally of Na v 1.8 channels, seen in vehicle-treated rats was suppressed by both drugs at 24 hours after injection. By 72 hours after injection, no difference in labeling between the drug- and vehicle-treated animals was observed. Sodium channel labeling in large DRG neurons returned to baseline between 1 and 2 weeks after CFA injection, whereas small cell labeling persisted. The cytochemical signal for sodium channel up-regulation in the large DRG cells that most closely correlates with inflammatory hyperalgesia is mediated at least in part through products of the cyclooxygenase pathway."}
{"text": "Until now, electrons have been regarded as elementary particles—which means that scientists thought they had no component parts or substructure. But now, electrons have been observed decaying into two separate parts—causing physicists to rethink what they know about the particles.\n\nThe electrons split into two separate parts, each carrying a particular property of the electron. In layman's terms? The first, called a \"spinon\" carries its spin—which causes electrons to behave a bit like compass point. The second, called an \"orbiton\" carries its orbital moment—that's what keeps electrons moving around the nucleus of atoms. The result is reported in this week's issue of Nature. Jeroen van den Brink, one of the researchers, explains:\n\n\"It had been known for some time that, in particular materials, an electron can in principle be split, but until now the empirical evidence for this separation into independent spinons and orbitons was lacking. Now that we know where exactly to look for them, we are bound to find these new particles in many more materials.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe observations were made in the copper-oxide compound Sr2CuO3, a material peculiar because the particles in it are constrained to move only in one direction, either forwards or backwards. The electron-splitting was measured using X-rays to measure the energy and momentum of particles in the material.\n\nThough the electrons can split, the resulting two parts can't escape the material in which they are produced. Regardless of that, the finding should transform our understanding of superconductivity—and could even eventually make high-temperature superconductivity a real possibility. And that way, my friend, lies a quantum computer you could own. [Nature via PhysOrg]\n\nImage by David Hilf"}

Recent field recordings (including those provided by volunteers within a citizen science project) were complemented by those from archives, each assigned to appropriate dialect by visual inspection of a sonogram, and the resulting spatial patterns of dialect distribution were interpreted using historical data on the yellowhammer invasion. The two countries differ markedly in the composition and distribution of dialects. New Zealand populations sing a greater number of different dialects, seven in total, five of which were not detected in the current British population, but have been reported by previous studies from the continental Europe. Two identified localities of capture (Brighton, Sussex, UK) and release (Dunedin, Otago, NZ) differ even more strikingly, having no dialects in common. The largely sedentary nature of yellowhammers allows for two mutually exclusive explanations for European dialects being detected in New Zealand but not in Great Britain: 1) the corresponding song types have emerged de novo in New Zealand, through convergent cultural evolution; 2) the dialects have disappeared from Great Britain, while being preserved in New Zealand. Indirect evidence from the widespread occurrence of these dialects in continental Europe and the reported stability of yellowhammer song, supports the latter explanation. We suggest that the yellowhammer dialect system is an avian equivalent of a phenomenon already noted in human languages, in which ancient words or structures are retained in expatriate communities."}

{"text": "The second-order azimuthal anisotropy Fourier harmonics, v 2 , are obtained in p − Pb and PbPb collisions over a wide pseudorapidity ( η ) range based on correlations among six or more charged particles. The p -Pb data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35 nb − 1 , were collected during the 2013 LHC p -Pb run at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV by the CMS experiment. A sample of semiperipheral PbPb collision data at s NN = 2.76 TeV , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.5 μ b − 1 and covering a similar range of particle multiplicities as the p − Pb data, is also analyzed for comparison. The six- and eight-particle cumulant and the Lee-Yang zeros methods are used to extract the v 2 coefficients, extending previous studies of two- and four-particle correlations. For both the p − Pb and PbPb systems, the v 2 values obtained with correlations among more than four particles are consistent with previously published four-particle results. These data support the interpretation of a collective origin for the previously observed long-range (large Δ η ) correlations in both systems. The ratios of v 2 values corresponding to correlations including different numbers of particles are compared to theoretical predictions that assume a hydrodynamic behavior of a p − Pb system dominated by fluctuations in the positions of participant nucleons. These results provide new insights into the multiparticle dynamics of collision systems with a very small overlapping region.\n\nDOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.012301"}

TCL is partners with Samsung and as stated earlier is the manufacturer of RCA HDTVs. The panel on this model is manufactured by Samsung, and it shows. You can pit the picture quality up against a TV costing twice as much and still this TV would blow it away or be on par with it. It will require some tuning out of the box, but most HDTVs require that anyways. Now onto the price, it's cheap because TCL is trying to make an entrance into the US HDTV market. Trying to make a name for their own, TCL is trying to sell their products at a reasonable and attainable/affordable price to prove to on-the-fence consumers that they mean business. They are the #1 manufacturer of televisions in China and have been for quite some time, as well as other regions around China.

A complex combination of risk factors, including a history of domestic violence, violent misdemeanor crimes and substance use disorders, increases the likelihood of people using a firearm against themselves or others. Firearm prohibitions for these high-risk groups have been shown to reduce gun violence. The suspect in this case, Devin Patrick Kelley, exhibited several of these red flags. Gun violence is a serious public health problem that requires attention to these risk factors, as well as more research to inform the development and implementation of empirically based prevention and threat assessment strategies.

The average global temperature has increased 0.8°C (1.4°F) since 1880, and most of that change has occurred in the past four decades.\n\nThe long-term trend is clearly represented by plotting temperature anomalies on the line graph, this time from 1880 onward.

However, one theme has come up in early reviews of the device that should give anyone preparing to shell out $250 for it pause: It apparently has subpar battery life.\n\nFROM EARLIER: Motorola's gorgeous Moto 360 smartwatch goes on sale today at noon\n\nTwo early reviews of the device, from The Wall Street Journal and The Verge, both call out the Moto 360's battery life as a significant problem.\n\n\"Even this big, honking model had to be charged twice a day,\" writes the Journal's Joanna Stern \"Most days, after charging it overnight, I had to put it back on its wireless charging cradle by 4 p.m. If only the large black circle could also work as a sundial so I could still tell the time when the battery dies.\"\n\n\"Motorola says the 360's battery lasts a day, but I haven't seen it last that long yet,\" writes The Verge's David Pierce. \"I don't expect a smartwatch to last weeks or years, but it ought to be able to last a day and a night no matter how much I use it. My watch now dies before my phone does, and that's unacceptable.\"\n\nBecause smartwatches are such a new technology, companies are still struggling to figure out what tradeoffs are necessary to optimize the user experience. This is particularly tricky with smartwatches because they can't be too big or they'll look silly on your wrist but they can't be too small either because they need to be mobile computers as well.\n\nNone of this means you shouldn't buy the Moto 360 but if you value a device that delivers really good battery life then it's certainly something to think about."}
{"text": "The Underground Reservoir is a watery underground location in Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow. Most of the area can be accessible by gaining dominance over Skula's soul, Deep Seeker, which allows Soma to breathe and walk underwater. This stage is connected to the Castle Corridor, the Underground Cemetery, the Forbidden Area and the Arena.\n\nContents show]\n\nOverview Edit\n\nLike in the Floating Garden, the Underground Reservoir doesn't contain a boss, although a Big Golem can be encountered here. Many of the enemies here are water-borne. This area is the also the only place where the Sky Fish can be found.\n\nIn one of the rooms, Soma will witness Graham Jones stabbing Yoko with a dagger. Arikado arrives at the scene and sends Soma after Graham, while he stays to take care of Yoko.\n\nBehind the big waterfall located in this stage, lies the entrance to the Forbidden Area. The trick to access it, is to equip Undine's soul (to be able to walk on the water's surface), and then equip and activate either the Curly's, Manticore's or Devil's soul to dash through the waterfall. The player will receive the Eversing armor along the way and find the door leading to the Forbidden Area on the other side.\n\nGallery Edit\n\nNotes Edit\n\nBesides the Arena, the Underground Reservoir also connects to the Underground Cemetery. This last area is completely optional and not visiting it won't affect the game's continuity in any way.\n\nThe Underground Reservoir also connects to the Forbidden Area, another optional location. It's advisable to visit this stage to obtain some very powerful items, like the Claimh Solais, one of the most powerful weapons in the game.\n\nRelated locations Edit"}

Burroughs to 36 months of probation, 120 hours of community service, and ordered to pay a fine of $5,000. In November 2016, Sullivan pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring with inmates to distribute Suboxone, a drug used to treat opioid addiction, between October and December 2015.\n\nIn January 2017, U.S. District Court Judge Richard G.

Both Sullivan and Weir have resigned from their positions as corrections officers.\n\nThe investigations revealed that Weir and Sullivan obtained Suboxone strips from sources outside the jail and smuggled the contraband into the facility when reporting for their shifts. Inmates receiving the Suboxone from Weir and Sullivan then sold the drug to other prisoners inside the correctional facility.\n\nEssex County Sheriff Kevin F. Coppinger said, \"We have a zero tolerance policy for this type of behavior and we will take swift and decisive action in all cases.\"\n\nActing United States Attorney William D. Weinreb; Harold H.

{"text": "FACT is an alternative way to provide a refuge for your cat. FACT is similar to crate-training for dogs. The cat accepts the crate or carrier as her own safe haven. For cats, the carrier should be big enough to hold bedding, food and water bowls, and a litter box big enough for the cat. Place the carrier in a quiet and secure place in the house, for example your bedroom. Cats prefer to be at a height where they can look down on their surroundings. Putting the carrier on a bench or dresser may make it more attractive to the cat. For cats who already associate the carrier with scary experiences (like trips to the vet) you can start out slowly. First, put the carrier in a place where the cat usually rests. Take off the top and the door. Put the cat's favorite blanket in the bottom of the carrier. Create positive associations with the carrier by playing with, petting, and feeding the cat near the carrier. Once she accepts this, attach the top of the carrier and let her get used to it too. Once the cat accepts both the top and the bottom, then add the door. If the cat is reluctant to use the carrier, applying Feliway spray may make her more comfortable.\n\nFACT not only provides the cat with a refuge in your home, but allows the cat to take her personal space with her everywhere she goes. Veterinary visits, boarding, travel, and moving to a new home are easier because the cat feels secure in her space. Having her own space also makes the cat less likely to feel the need to compete with other animals for territory and may help decrease fighting and urine marking.

{"text": "According to a new report from China Times (translated by GforGames), Apple will make the next-gen iPhone even thinner by moving from two brightness enhancement films in the iPhone's display to just one. The move will reportedly allow Apple to have an overall thinner design for the iPhone 6, but could cause supply issues in the process as its suppliers work to get the new display tech ready. According to the report, the switch to a single brightness enhancement film in the new backlight might result in yield issues:\n\nThe best 4K & 5K displays for Mac\n\nHowever, up until now Apple and Miebea (the supplier) have used two BEFs, and delivering a new backlight with just a single brightness enhancement film can allegedly cause yield issues. To our understanding, the reason why a single BEF could cause yield issues is because the remaining layer needs to be better enough to get the job done by itself. As for the alleged yield problems, these reports suggest that some of Minebea's backlight orders will be taken over by OMRON and Radiant.\n\nThe report adds what we've heard from several other sources in recent weeks that Apple is gearing up for mass production in July for a September launch. It also claims Apple will be continuing to use in-cell technology, something that recent rumors claimed would be replaced. Lastly, the report says Apple's usual suppliers including LG, JDI and SHARP— not Innolux— will provide displays for the device. China Times typically reports a lot of supply chain chatter, some of which doesn't always turn out to be accurate.\n\nThe most recent report from reliable sources claimed two iPhone 6 models— a 4.7-inch display and a larger 5.5-inch design— would hit mass production in July and go on sale simultaneously later in the fall."}

In 2014 it released its free B4UFLY app for iOS and Android that offers flying tips as well as maps showing restricted areas such as airports, stadiums, and prisons.\n\nAnd last year it launched a scheme requiring most drone owners to register their copter (details here), a move it said would help to \"foster a greater awareness on the part of users to learn the rules about flying safely\" in U.S. airspace, and also enable the authorities to quickly trace the drone's owner in the event of an incident.\n\nDownload for iOS Download for Android"}

{"text": "Rob Zombie's film career has been defined by horror until this point: House of 1,000 Corpses, the two Halloween films, and his upcoming The Lords of Salem are explicitly horror, and The Devil's Rejects is such grimy exploitation that it has to be viewed as horror at its core. We've known he might move away from the genre at some point, and that time may be now. And why should guys like Kevin Smith be the only ones to make hockey movies?\n\nZombie is attached to write, produce and direct Broad Street Bullies, a film based on the career of the upstart and ultimately winning '70s Philadelphia Flyers hockey team. But don't worry about some of Zombie's trademarks; as a '70s hockey film, and specifically one about the 'take no prisoners' Flyers, there's a lot of room for violence here.\n\nDeadline says the film came about thanks to Zombie picking up the film rights to the team, and the Flyers are reportedly fully behind the project. For what he's aiming to make, think \"Rocky meets Boogie Nights on ice,\" and he explains,\n\nEach character involved is more outrageous than the next. The backdrop of the turbulent year of 1974 is perfect for this 'stranger than fiction' sports tale.\n\nThe idea is to shoot the film \"shortly,\" and more than anything else, the idea of Zombie making a movie with a happy ending — the Flyers won the Stanley Cup in '74 — is seriously strange.\n\nHere's the 2010 HBO documentary Broad Street Bullies, which chronicles the team in less fictionalized fashion than Zombie is likely to make.\n\nBy the way, the trailer for The Lords of Salem has been shown at Zombie's live show during this summer, but there isn't an official online release at this point."}
{"text": "Opened two years ago in Neuschonau, Bavaria, in Germany, the tree-top walk is the longest of it's kind at 1300 meters that takes you to an impressive height of 25 meters above the tree tops. The walkway ends at an oval shaped dome, 44 meters high. The 360-degree spiral staircase around the dome offers breathtaking views of the surrounding nature. In clear weather you can even see the north ridge of the Alps. The tree-top walk is a part of the largest protected forest area in central Europe – Bavarian Forest National Park, which is also the first national park in Germany.\n\nThe tree-top walk, Baumwipfelpfad in German, begins with a short elevator ride or stair climb to the ticket booth, a mere 8 meter above the parking lot. As hikers begin the leisurely walk down a 1300-meter long wood path, the ground begins to gently fall away -- or so it appears -- as the path inclines almost imperceptibly, making it easily accessible for parents with strollers. It is obvious the creators of the Baumwipfelpfad wanted to make visitors feel a part of the natural environment. The path advances freely through the forest, leaving the mature pines forever undisturbed.\n\nSeveral adventure stations are placed along the walkway including a narrow wooden plank enticing hardy trekkers to balance on the beam. These obstacles are fully-enclosed with a safety net and offers a rewarding view of the earth 50 feet below. The observation dome is shaped like a giant egg. Once at the top, a spectacular view awaits the visitors.\n\nPhoto credit\n\nPhoto credit\n\nPhoto credit\n\nPhoto credit\n\nPhoto credit\n\nPhoto credit\n\nPhoto credit\n\nPhoto credit\n\nPhoto credit\n\n[via]"}

You'll need to download gif2webp from Google. With gif2webp available, you can convert your animated GIF image to WEBP:\n\ngif2webp animation.gif -o animation.webp\n\ngif2webp provides numerous options for output modification like quality, multi-threading encoding, etc.\n\nImagine the boost in your site load time if you created and served WEBP images where they're supported.

Marijuana is currently illegal throughout Australia, but two states are considering making the drug available for therapeutic uses.\n\n\"This government understands that there are some Australians suffering from severe conditions for which cannabis may have applications and we want to enable access to the most effective medical treatments available,\" Health Minister Sussan Ley told Parliament.\n\nThe bill is guaranteed to become law, with the main opposition party immediately pledging support.\n\nSoutheast Asia has some of the world's toughest drug laws.\n\nIndonesia, Australia's nearest neighbour after Papua New Guinea, created a diplomatic rift last year by rejecting Australian pleas to spare the lives of two Australian heroin traffickers. The Australians were among eight drug convicts executed by firing squad in April. Indonesia argued that the tough response was needed because narcotics abuse among Indonesians had reached a crisis level.\n\nEdward Aspinall, an Australian National University expert on Indonesian politics, did not expect marijuana crops growing legally in Australia would damage relations with Indonesia.\n\n\"If it even rates notice among the Indonesian authorities or politicians, it will just be seen as an example of the inappropriately liberal and permissive nature of Western societies,\" Aspinall said.\n\nThe government said the proposed amendment would meet Australia's international obligations to ensure that production, manufacture and distribution of marijuana was for medical and scientific purposes only.\n\nA government survey of 24,000 Australians nationwide found in 2013 that 69 per cent of respondents supported a change of law to permit cannabis use for medicinal purposes."}

Not to be confused as essentia, vis is collected in your wand and produced inside aura nodes and from slain vanilla mobs.

Vis orbs can be found by killing mobs, carrying a primal charm, or standing near an Unstable Node. There are 6 types of Vis naturally found in Aura Nodes or vis orbs: Aer (air), Terra (earth), Ignis (fire), Aqua (water), Ordo (order), and Perditio (entropy). These are the six primal aspects. Sometimes, a compound aspect may be present in an aura node, and most special nodes will have at least one.\n\nHungry nodes tend to have the aspects Fames and Lucrum.\n\nSinister nodes tend to have aspects such as Examinis, Mortuus and Tenebrae.\n\nPure nodes grown in silverwood trees tend to have the aspect, Victus\n\nUsage Edit\n\nMostly stored and used through wands, see that page for more details.

{"text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Until now, South Korean troops have been forced to rely on a dwindling number of public payphones\n\nMore than 44,000 mobile phones are being distributed to South Korea's military personnel - but they can only receive calls.\n\nThe phones are being given to members of all four branches of Korea's armed forces - the army, navy, air force and marines - to make it easier for them to stay in touch with friends and family while in their barracks, the Chosun Ilbo website reports. At the moment, urgent private calls have to be taken through an administration office.\n\nDue to defence ministry budget restrictions, the scheme was initially only going to apply to barracks in remote areas or on the front line, the report notes. But after telecoms company LG Uplus stepped in to fund the cost of the handsets and the network maintenance, the number was increased to 44,686 phones, covering every one of the military's barracks. The company reportedly agreed to foot the bill after hearing that some patriotic conscripts delayed their discharge from military service until recent cross-border tensions with North Korea eased.\n\nUntil now, mobile phones have been deemed a security issue and have been forbidden to members of South Korea's armed forces, meaning a reliance on the dwindling number of public payphones in the country. Using the one-way phones will only be allowed during free time in the evening and before a 22:00 curfew. But perhaps to avoid service personnel waiting in vain for their phones to ring, they'll also be able to send certain preset text messages, such as: \"Please call me today.\" The ministry says the scheme will \"help ease anxiety\" for both soldiers and their families.\n\nNext story: NZ bans award-winning teen novel\n\nUse #NewsfromElsewhere to stay up-to-date with our reports via Twitter."}
{"text": "Apple is currently being sued by a company in ownership of the 'iWatch' trademark, despite the fact that Apple did not use that name for its first wearable. Apple announced the Apple Watch last year, though up until then it was largely referred to as the iWatch in rumours.\n\na studio known as 'Probendi', owns the iWatch trademark in Europe, the company filed a suit on the 26th of June this year after discovering that the Apple Watch is the first thing that pops up when you look up the 'iWatch' in search engines.\n\nThe court document was obtained by Bloomberg, which says: \"Apple has systematically used iWatch wording on Google search engine in order to direct customers to its own website, advertising Apple Watch\". According to the studio, the iWatch trademark should be worth around $97 million.\n\nApparently, Probendi brought up its concerns with Apple last year though the company never replied. That said, it has avoided using the term iWatch publicly and in marketing materials, so it hasn't really done anything wrong legally. The studio also got in touch with Google over the search rankings, though Google claimed that it is not responsible for links on its page.\n\nA hearing over this lawsuit is set to take place on the 11th of November. Probendi was working on its own Android Wear smartwatch, which would have been called the iWatch, though these plans have been put on hold for the time being.\n\nDiscuss on our Facebook page, HERE.\n\nKitGuru Says: This lawsuit seems pretty flimsy. Apple has not publicly referred to its smartwatch as the iWatch and therefore, isn't really impeding on the trademarked name. It will be interesting to see how this one plays out but it likely won't get very far, after all, Apple does have a solid legal team on its side."}

{"text": "Geek-on-geek crime isn't a laughing matter.\n\nOver the weekend, actors James Franco and Seth Rogen took to Saturday Night Live to make light of last week's announcement of a November cyber attack on Sony's entertainment division. In the show's monologue, the stars of the upcoming film The Interview—the production that is suspected to be the impetus behind the attack—shared photos that they jokingly claimed has been been stolen from their phones, and a good laugh was had by all.\n\nWell, maybe not all. It's safe to say that Sony and its employees aren't amused by the situation. In addition to 47,000 social security numbers and uncomfortable salary information, the breach is alleged to include details as personal as one executive's breastfeeding details. The hackers say they have 100 terabytes of data which they claim they will release if Sony doesn't comply with their demand to stop the release of The Interview, in which Franco and Rogen play journalists recruited by the CIA to assassinate North Korean despot Kim Jong-un.\n\nIt remains unclear who executed the attack, but as this Reuters graphic makes clear, there is no shortage of bad actors. According to Akamai's quarterly State of the Internet report, the biggest source of attacks in the second quarter of this year was China, with 43 percent of attacks originating there—almost triple the 15 percent being launched from second-place Indonesia. And U.S. cyberspace is no haven either: 13 percent of attacks were reported to have been based from American IP addresses.\n\nWhile some former Sony employees are contemplating a class action lawsuit, North Korea continues to deny involvement, instead suggesting that its supporters (North Korea has supporters?) were behind the \"righteous attack.\" Whoever it was, the mere scope of the stolen data means that this could be a headache for Sony for a long time to come."}

Being passive aggressive in this competition means you're fine with simply going with the flow and unwilling to disturb the calm waters of the game to accomplish your goals.\n\nI see that as a weakness.

According to a New York Times article published on Wednesday, \"Pizzagate\" shooter Edgar Welch, apparently not totally allergic to self-reflection, wishes he had done a few things differently this week.\n\n\nOn Sunday, Welch, armed with an assault rifle, walked into D.C. pizza restaurant Comet Ping Pong and fired a few shots.

{"text": "Touchscreen publishing company Onswipe has good news for Samsung. As Onswipe's Chief Marketing Officer Jason Baptiste put it in an email, \"Samsung clearly won Christmas when it comes to tablets.\"\n\nSpecifically, the company looked at visitors to Onswipe-optimized sites for the period of Dec. 26-29 in comparison to Dec. 19-22, as a way to measure the growth that different tablet platforms saw over Christmas. The results? Samsung's Galaxy tablets grew 50.4 percent, Nexus 7 tablets grew 33.8 percent, iPads grew 20.4 percent, and Kindle Fires grew 19.5 percent.\n\nNow, the fact that Onswipe focused on percentage growth is an important caveat here. After all, Samsung was presumably starting from (much) less, so it didn't need to sell as many tablets to see significant growth.\n\nIt's also interesting to see the line about Samsung's victory coming from Baptiste, who recently wrote a blog post telling people to \"stop believing the fairy tales about the iPad's demise.\" I asked him if the data made him reconsider the post, and he said no: \"Though they enjoyed more growth post holidays, Samsung is still very tiny compared to the iPad and the same goes for the rest of Android. What will be interesting is seeing whether people still use Android tablets 90 days out from now.\"\n\nBaptiste also provided some numbers about usage. He said the average session time from Samsung users was three minutes and nine seconds after Christmas, down from 3:32 before. On iPad, the average session was 4:03, compared to 4:12 before. And the Kindle Fire had the longest session time on average, 4:51.\n\nAs for how many people this data represents, Baptiste said Onswipe (which recently upgraded its platform) reaches 31 million unique visitors each month on the mobile web."}

{"text": "In the market for an 80 percent lower? The 80 lower receiver is a vital component for any do-it-yourself AR-15 or AR 10 build. An 80 percent lower receiver provides the builder an opportunity to complete their own custom AR-15 rifle or pistol without any paperwork or FFL (Federal Firearm License) transfer. By definition of the law, an 80% lower receiver is NOT considered a firearm since it is not 100% completed. By design, the 80 percent lower still requires the builder to complete the last 20% of milling. Typically, the completion of an 80% lower is accomplished using an 80 lower jig.\n\nWhile the 80 percent lower receiver allows a builder to complete a firearm themselves, this also allows the builder to build a rifle or pistol that does not require registration with the government since no serialization is required (although recommended). You can simply order an 80% lower and we send it right to you without any of that clunky government oversight.\n\nThere are several types of 80 percent lower receivers available to AR builders. The types of 80% lowers that are popular in the AR enthusiast community are the: AR15 80 lower, AR10 80 lower, billet lower receiver, forged lower receiver and 80 lower jig kit. Each type of 80 percent lower provides its own benefits, but, ultimately, depends on what the builder is looking for in their AR 10, AR 15 rifle or AR 15 Pistol build.\n\nBenefits of an 80 Percent Lower:\n\n- No FFL required\n\n- No serialization required\n\n- Minimal technical skills required to complete\n\n- Maintains the custom integrity of your build\n\n- Corrosion-resistant aluminum\n\n- Manufactured from 7075 aerospace aluminum alloy\n\n- CNC machined to Mil-Spec standards\n\n- Made in the USA\n\nYour build awaits."}

I think there are several assertions he relies on that we might question, or certainly would want to test further, and there are other considerations not mentioned that we think are relevant. It is a complex issue and, at least from our perspective, one that does not lend itself easily to a simple 'agree' or 'disagree.' \"\n\nThose in the gambling industry, of course, are cheering Silver on. \"We agree with Commissioner Silver that a legal and regulated sports betting industry, like we have in Nevada and elsewhere in the world, is the best way to protect the integrity of sporting events,\" said Joe Asher, the chief executive of William Hill US in Nevada.\n\nThough any immediate shift in federal gambling laws is a long shot, leagues have in the past changed their views when money was involved. For years, leagues did not take money from liquor companies that wanted to advertise in arenas and stadiums.

The policy change was precipitated in large part by the security breach attributed to Chinese hackers; Google's IT leaders apparently feel that Microsoft's OS represents too great a risk across the enterprise to leave it in place.\n\nThe story says that in January, subsequent to the security breaches, Windows installations on desktop computers were no longer allowed, although laptops were still eligible for Windows at the employee's discretion. Many Google staffers, however, were already heading for the Mac as a security measure, and at this point things have been pretty well laid down in stone: \"Getting a new Windows machine now requires CIO approval,\" according to one anonymous Googler quoted by the FT.\n\nGoogle has long offered employees a choice of OS for their primary workstation, and some dissatisfaction with the new rules has been registered; however, the sentiment is apparently not that negative, considering the alternative possibilities. \"It would have made more people upset if they banned Macs rather than Windows,\" says an unnamed employee.

Online sportsbook Bodog pegged Team North America's 23-and-under young 'uns as 11-to-1 to win the tournament just before it began, with Russia the four-to-1 second choice behind favoured Canada. Earlier in the summer, the kids were as long as 20-to-1.\n\nNow, off a pair of contrasting openers - NA was way too much for Finland in their opener, while Russia looked humdrum in losing to Sweden - and the kids are favoured to beat the Russians and go to 2-0 according to the latest odds on Monday's game, and sit right behind Sweden at 4-to-1 to win the tournament, while Russia has dropped to fourth in the reckoning at 9-to-1. In Europe the spread between the Swedes and team NA is a little wider, though not by much.\n\nCanada remains odds-on to win, of course, and this one against Russia will doubtless be a much different proposition than the opener.

You shouldn't be. It's a fairly normal assumption to make when one is clearly carried.\n\nHe may be a great Mercy. GM level even.

Many seemed unaware that the video game avatar onscreen was being controlled Wizard of Oz style by a man literally behind a curtain. The real marvel came in how readily some onlookers seemed to be to believe they were interacting with a sophisticated algorithm. Faith, it seems, is in full supply at PAX.\n\nThe gameplay itself is centered around players assuming the role of Bobby, and delivering his sermons as best they can. Users will be scored on things like body language and cadence, and the audience can be made up of other players who simply want to watch. As the Twitch integration for the developing project gets refined it's easy to imagine that soon there will be actual cults of personality forming on Twitch.

All of them received minor injuries. As for the kids on the buses, they were safe and sound, thanks to the brave policeman, who was seriously injured himself.\n\nKosolapov is now conscious and in a stable condition, spokesman for the region's police, Sergey Kuznetsov, reports, adding the officer has already spoken to his colleagues.\n\nKhakassia's police have received a lot of letters, thanking the courageous hero cop. If the doctors allow it, a group of children who were on the buses, will pay a visit to their rescuer, Kuznetsov added.\n\nThe authorities have opened a criminal case against the reckless driver, who put the children's lives in danger."}

The Emulex workforce reduction of 10% is part of the plan. It would also include consolidation of certain engineering activities and closure of its Bolton, Massachusetts facility. The Company said it expects to incur up to $10 million of restructuring charges.\n\nThe restructuring comes on the heels of a $175 million convertible senior note financing and the sale of about $4.7 million of common stock to (Underdisclosed.com favorite) Starboard Value in mid-November.\n\nOn November 11, 2013, Emulex seemed to get its relationship with activist investor (also an Underdisclosed.com favorite) Elliott Associates in order, which reinstated Elliott's standstill and included agreement on the composition of the board of directors. At the same time, Emulex announced that is Executive Chairman of the Board would be stepping down.\n\nBased on the timing and character of the SEC filing with these announcements, it appears that these were preconditions to selling $180 million of convertibles notes and shares of common stock. In addition, it seems to have transformed Emulex' relationship with Elliott from activist shareholder to passive shareholder. Elliott now discloses its holdings in, and intent for, Emulex in a Schedule 13G instead of Schedule 13D.\n\nHowever, Emulex still has to deal with Starboard.\n\nHopefully, the governance changes and financings will help Emulex right the ship. We'll wait to see what year-end numbers look like. However, in the last quarter, a $657 thousand profit in 2012 turned into a $3.6 million loss."}

Susan Collins and backed by the Democrats' leader in that chamber, Sen. Harry Reid — is a more narrow version of the \"terrorism watchlist\" gun ban measure proposed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein that was rejected earlier in the week.\n\nCollins' measure utilizes the No-Fly List and the Selectee List as the basis for restricting gun purchases — which would include a far narrower group of individuals than the broad terrorism watchlist used in Feinstein's original proposal — but that change was not enough to lead the ACLU to support the measure.\n\n\"The ACLU strongly urges you to vote against the Collins Amendment because it uses the error-prone and unfair watchlist system, along with vague and overbroad terms, as a predicate for a proceeding to deny a firearms permit,\" the ACLU officials wrote in the letter. \"The Collins Amendment relies on both the No Fly List, by codifying its criteria, and the Selectee List, by direct reference.\"\n\nThe ACLU letter goes on to detail concerns with the due process protections in the amendment, stating that the amendment would provide even fewer protections than the amendment proposed by Sen. John Cornyn earlier this week — which the ACLU also opposed.\n\nFinally, the organization warns that the Collins amendment \"would impose a notification requirement that could result in a new 'watchlist' broader than any that currently exists.\" This is so, the ACLU argues, because the amendment would require officials \"to be informed of each application for a firearm by any person who has been on the master watchlist at any point over the past five years—even if the person has been cleared of any wrongdoing, the investigation was otherwise closed, or the person was long ago removed from the list.\""}

Although the recent data are stored in csv format, older data are stored in html, or even scanned pdfs.\n\nIllinois has one of the largest international student populations in the US, and attracts over a third of its students from out of state.

{"text": "Comcast, the nation's largest cable provider, told a familiar story through its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday: overall growth despite continued slippage in television subscribers, and unflattering comparisons to last year.\n\nThe biggest part of the sprawling company, Comcast Cable, reported a 5.2 percent uptick in revenue by signing up more broadband Internet users and by squeezing about $10 more a month from its average television subscriber. Thus, Comcast came out ahead, even though it lost 129,000 of its 21.6 million TV subscribers in the quarter, slightly more than it lost in the period last year.\n\nThese trends — increases on the broadband side and decreases on the television side — have been evident in Comcast's earnings for years amid stiff competition from Verizon and AT&T's TV services and changes in consumer behavior. Many of Comcast's customers pay the company for an all-inclusive package of TV, broadband and phone. But the company is rapidly approaching the point where it will have more broadband subscribers than TV subscribers.\n\nThree years ago, Comcast had about 23 million TV subscribers and almost 17 million broadband subscribers; now, it has 21.6 million on the TV side and 20.3 million on the broadband side.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat's partly why the company's newest promotion, which it calls Internet Plus, is aimed at persuading people to sign up for broadband plus entry-level TV service. The package, $50 a month for the first 12 months, emphasizes on-demand TV by including HBO and its HBO GO streaming service as well as Comcast's own Streampix, but it also includes broadcast television channels and a set-top box. The package gained press attention last week because it eschews the typical channel bundle and comes close to selling HBO via the Internet without any other TV service. But Comcast executives played down the significance of the move, saying that it was intended to hook new subscribers."}

The Ravens' official site confirmed the report on Monday afternoon.\n\nHarbaugh has been the team's head coach since 2008, going 85-59 (.590) in the regular season and 10-5 in the playoffs with a Super Bowl win in 2012 over his brother, John, and the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nThis is a welcome extension for Harbaugh, who has had to oversee the aging of Baltimore's once-heralded defense and a rash of injuries over the past five seasons. The former special teams coordinator took over for Brian Billick just six years after Billick led the team to a win in Super Bowl XXXV.\n\nThe Ravens have been in a sort of limbo over the past four seasons. Since 2013, the team has finished 8-8, 10-6, 5-11 and 8-8. Always seemingly in contention for at least a portion of the season, the Ravens have been searching for an identity and a way to sustain their success. In 2016, their defense had one of its best seasons since the 2012 Super Bowl run. This past offseason, the team added veterans like running back Danny Woodhead and wideout Jeremy Maclin to help push their offense in the same direction.\n\nDespite these uneven times, Harbaugh is still widely considered one of the better head coaches in football. He is 10th among active coaches in wins and winning percentage. The Ravens also have made the playoffs in all but three of Harbaugh's seasons, and since Harbaugh's arrival in 2008, only the Patriots have won more playoff games.\n\nHe is the third head coach in franchise history, alongside Billick and the late Ted Marchibroda."}

He also said he didn't expect the Federal Reserve to further raise interest rates following its decision in December to enact the first hike in nearly a decade.\n\nSoros said the Fed waited too long to hike, missing its \"window of opportunity\" by about a year and instead \"raising interest rates when the U.S. economy is already slowing down\" due to deflation.\n\n\"The key issue is deflation…We just don't know how to handle it. It's a different environment, but now we have to face it,\" he said.\n\nSoros said a hard landing for China is \"unavoidable\" and that the country's policies are contributing to the global deflationary environment.\n\n\"China can manage it. It's got resources and a greater latitude in choosing policies than most other countries because it has over $3 trillion of reserves and so on,\" he said. \"However, they have a way of inflicting their problem…on to the rest of the world.\"\n\nIn the interview, Soros repeated his previous warning that the European Union faces a devastating series of crises that threaten its very existence.\n\nProviding critical information for the U.S. trading day.

{"text": "Facebook's analysis of the sentiment of users talking about Hillary Clinton shows a gradual but marked downturn in the tone of conversation about the presumptive Democratic candidate as the 2016 campaign approaches.\n\nThe share of conversation about Clinton that was positive dipped from 57% during one period in the fall to 52% in January and then a 50% average in February. By Feb. 28, that sentiment turned negative, and has stayed largely more negative than positive as conversations multiplied amid debate over her use of a personal email account.\n\nThe sentiment data is drawn from a Facebook project that analyzes the language and symbols used by the massive social networks users. (You can read more about the project here.) The data has been shared with BuzzFeed News in a partnership with Facebook.\n\nThe sentiment data may not mirror polling data, though it has so far roughly tracked public polls. Her favorability rating has gradually declined, from peak over 60% in 2010, to below 50%, according to a recent New York Times average of public polls.\n\nAnd the sentiment data also offers a glimpse at how the under-the-surface conversation about Clinton may shift, despite the challenge — for both Clinton and her Republican foes — of changing public opinion about so well-known a person.\n\nLast week, the news of her family's foundation quietly accepting foreign donations was followed by news that Clinton exclusively used personal email while at the State Department on Monday. Reports that Clinton used a private server located in her own home followed. Questions remain about how Clinton's staff selected email to be sent to the State Department, whether her email was sufficiently secured during her tenure there, and whether Obama administration officials ever told Clinton or her senior aides to stop using the account.\n\nThose stories caused a huge, sustained spike in the number of Facebook interactions about Clinton.\n\nBut even before the story broke, the sentiment around her had dipped from earlier this year — and was in the upper 40s in terms of positive sentiment."}
{"text": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS:\n\nAccurate diagnosis and treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is challenging in clinical practice because of differing upper limits of normal (ULN) for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). This review summarises the various definitions of SCH and their impact on reported SCH prevalence.\n\nMETHODOLOGY:\n\nArticles reporting the prevalence of SCH in relation to the ULN of TSH in human studies were identified through an English-language PubMed search for 'subclinical hypothyroidism,' 'prevalence,' and 'TSH' within the title and/or abstract. Relevant articles and related literature were selected for inclusion.\n\nRESULTS:\n\nEstimates for the prevalence of SCH varied by sex, age, race/ethnicity, and geographic location (range, 0.4-16.9%). Higher rates of SCH were consistently reported in women (0.9-16.9%) and older individuals (2.7-16.9%). However, the ULN of TSH in those considered free of thyroid disease and not at risk increased progressively with age, suggesting that reports of SCH prevalence in elderly people may be overestimated. Multiple studies reported an increased risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism among individuals with elevated TSH and antithyroid antibodies.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\n\nGiven the variable definition of SCH based on an inconsistent ULN for TSH, it is currently difficult to ascertain the true prevalence of SCH and to correctly label and treat patients with SCH; use of age-adjusted definitions may be considered when assessing prevalence. A diagnosis of SCH does not necessarily merit treatment, especially if TSH elevations are transient (i.e. not persistent for > 3-6 months) and the patient lacks other risk factors for developing overt hypothyroidism.\n\n© 2015 The Authors.

Although he reveals many talents, this yearning shows in his dislike of coming in first, as the cast eventually realizes. He becomes quite bothered when someone disrupts his \"simplicity\", and goes to extreme lengths to get it back. He keeps a collection of his own fingernail clippings, and believes when they grow quickly he has trouble. Kira also has a bizarre fetish for the female hand, stemming from an erotic fascination with the hands of the Mona Lisa. Unfortunately, his desire has never extended to the rest of the female person.\n\n\nHe is the main antagonist of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable.\n\n\nOriginally, Kira murdered his victims by stabbing them so viciously they were left with horrific back wounds (their hideous nature is implied by the fact that the reader is never actually shown Reimi's wound). However, his Stand, Killer Queen, eventually awoke from his desire to leave no evidence behind of his killings—hence its ability to make its victims completely disintegrate. He now lets Killer Queen annihilate his victims (except for his \"girlfriend\"-hands), letting everyone else think that the victims have simply gone missing. Even if the number of missing attracts attention (as it eventually does), no one would have any reason to suspect that Kira was involved.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\n\nVoice Actors Morikawa, Toshiyuki Japanese\n\n\nSee More What JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Says About Masculinity in Japan An exploration of masculinity and male genders roles in Japanese society throughout the years using parts 1-4 of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. by MFA_Community 31,801 views"}
{"text": "Friends, relatives, and co-workers are forever recommending movies—with mixed results. But what if those recommendations came from a more knowledgeable source? The Tribeca Shortlist is a relatively new steaming platform that enlists industry insiders and experts to curate a collection of award-winning films available to stream online. One of the films available in May is Julian Schnabel's The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, which, as actor Tom Hiddleston explains in the exclusive clip above, had a profound impact on him.\n\nThe 2007 film was a festival favorite and showered with awards and nominations for tackling a seemingly impossible adaptation. As Hiddleston points out, the 1997 book on which the film is based was dictated entirely by Jean-Dominique Bauby—a former journalist suffering from locked-in syndrome—blinking his eyes. It's exactly the kind of film that shouldn't have been a success, and because it works so well, many, including Hiddleston, consider it essential viewing for movie lovers. Hiddleston's entire collection of Shortlist movies is called \"Stories of Heartbreak and Humor.\"\n\n\"We're taking a more human approach to movie discovery for viewers who want to escape the search spiral and find a great movie fast,\" Tribeca Shortlist president Jeff Bronikowski said when the platform launched last October. \"We've found great movies that we're offering to subscribers as part of a high quality, highly curated movie catalog with exclusive 'Shortlist' content that provides context and personal insight, like getting a recommendation from a trusted friend.\"\n\nThe service—available for $4.99 per month—is easy accessible via Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Roku, iPhone, iPad, and more.

{"text": "Where does a liver for a transplant come from?\n\nThere are two types of liver transplant options: living donor transplant and deceased donor transplant.\n\nLiving donor.\n\nLiving donor liver transplants are an option for some patients with end-stage liver disease. This involves removing a segment of liver from a healthy living donor and implanting it into a recipient. Both the donor and recipient liver segments will grow to normal size in a few weeks to months.\n\nThe donor, who may be a blood relative, spouse, or friend, will have extensive medical and psychological evaluations to ensure the lowest possible risk. Blood type and body size are critical factors in determining who is an appropriate donor.\n\nRecipients for the living donor transplant must be active on the transplant waiting list. Their health must also be stable enough to undergo transplantation with excellent chances of success.\n\nDeceased Donor.\n\nIn deceased donor liver transplant, the donor may be a victim of an accident or head injury. The donor's heart is still beating, but the brain has stopped functioning. Such a person is considered legally dead, because his or her brain has permanently and irreversibly stopped working. At this point, the donor is usually in an intensive-care unit.\n\nThe identity of a deceased donor and circumstances surrounding the person's death are kept confidential.\n\nScreening for Liver Transplant Donors\n\nHospitals will evaluate all potential liver transplant donors for evidence of liver disease, alcohol or drug abuse, cancer, or infection. Donors will also be tested for hepatitis, AIDS, and other infections. If this screening does not reveal problems with the liver, donors and recipients are matched according to blood type and body size. Age, race, and sex are not considered.\n\nThe transplant team will discuss your transplantation options with you at the time of your pre-transplant evaluation, or you can contact the transplant team for more information."}

Color within the lines; avoid risk; be a good boy scout.\n\nSome of this will be well intentioned; many think you'll fare better if you don't rock the boat. Others are ass-faces who find reassurance in knowing that they're not the only ones who chose the safe path.\n\nThe plan goes like this: study hard, get good grades, attend a respected university, find a decent job, work your way up the ladder, procreate (twice), and upgrade your home every 5 – 10 years. All of which are fine, but this is just one course amongst many.\n\nWhat if there's another way?\n\nWhat if you dropped out of school and walked across the country? What if you decided grades were sort of silly, and instead read all the interesting things you could find? What if you volunteered some time in a developing country and met someone who'd never spent a moment thinking about Chandler and Monica? What if you tasted every taste, saw every sight, faced the things that frightened you, and got a couple of scuffs along the way?\n\nYou have one life. Live it as you will, but perhaps take a moment to consider an alternative path. There is a wide chasm between the ways you could pass through existence and the lame-ass lives most choose. Besides, should you fail, you'll at least have a couple of good stories to tell.\n\nDo whatever you want. I'm not here to prescribe life decisions. At the same time, I feel it's worth reminding you that within 100 years you, and everyone you love, will be gone.
