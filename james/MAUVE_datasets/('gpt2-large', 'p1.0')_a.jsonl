Like salmon, they are diadromous, which means they split their life cycle between salt water and fresh water. Each spring they return from the ocean to &quot;run&quot; up Long Island's tributaries to spawn in fresh water. Unfortunately, dams and culverts have restricted their access to most of this important habitat.</p><p>Seatuck is working with partners across the region to improve access and restore local populations of these ecologically important fish. The Long Island Volunteer River Herring Survey - organized by Seatuck, the Long Island Sound Study and Peconic Estuary Program - aims to find the tributaries where &quot;remnant&quot; runs of river herring still exist and then to monitior the size and timing of those runs.</p><p>Participants in the survey are asked to commit to surveying a local tributary from mid-March through mid-May. The survey protocol involves visiting a neighborhood river or stream and spending 15 minutes looking for alewife or signs of their presence.

They live roughly three millennia in Earth's future, a time when hyperspace travel has been discovered, and a few worlds relatively close to Earth have been colonized—fifty planets known as the &quot;Spacer Worlds&quot;. The Spacer worlds are rich, have low population density (average population of one hundred million each), and use robot labor very heavily. Meanwhile, Earth is overpopulated (with a total population of eight billion), and strict rules against robots have been passed. The eponymous &quot;caves of steel&quot; are vast city complexes covered by huge metal domes, capable of supporting tens of millions each. The New York City of that era, for example, encompasses present-day New York City, as well as large tracts of New Jersey. Asimov imagines the present day's underground transit connected to malls and apartment blocks, extended to a point where no one ever exits to the outside world. Indeed, most of the population cannot leave, as they suffer from extreme agoraphobia. Even though the Robot and Foundation series were not considered to be part of</p>"}
