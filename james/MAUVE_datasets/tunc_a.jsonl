The Centre for Prevention of HIV\/AIDS carried out a report today on the evolution of attitudes in Montenegro regarding gay rights, homophobia and human rights. Thirty five percent of respondents considered homosexuality an illness and 65% judged the practice illegal. Ivo Kopec, political correspondent for the Associated Press, reports that the LGBT community is opposed to gay rights as it ignores the widespread suffering the LGBT community has suffered in the region. The LGBT community has been subjected to military operations in Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia, considered to be military provocations and has been criminalized in many states. As in many other places, mainly in Latin America, the biggest threats to the LGBT community come from the fundamentalist communities. These communities have fought for years against various LGBT programs as they have been deemed to be a threat to their religious beliefs. Article 78 of the Constitution of Montenegro states: &quot;The State shall grant religious services to those who refuse to acknowledge or embrace the teachings of other religions.&quot; Article 83 of the Constitutional Act<\/p>"}

During their conversation, Wall was asked about Thursday's win over the shorthanded Grizzlies and how this year's<\/strong><\/p><p>undefeated Kentucky Wildcats would fare against NBA teams (which got a little awkward). He also talked to Wall about where he ranks among the NBA's fastest players.<\/p><p>Dan Patrick: Is there anybody faster than you in the NBA? John Wall: No. DP: If I put you and Russell Westbrook, 40 yard dash? JW: I win. DP: Is it close? JW: I think it'd be close, very close. He's explosive. I think I'm fast going straight, he's quick and explosive. DP: OK, what are you going to run a 40 in? JW: I don't know, I heard with the 40 you gotta have some technique, so I wouldn't want to lie and say I could run a 4.3, so I'll say a 4.5 at the slowest. DP: Oh you'll run a 4.5 without even stretching. You'll run a 4.5. JW: [Laughs] I have no idea, I'll have to try it out one day, I've never tested it.<\/p>"}
