That's the period when independent movie-makers started making films that broke the mould much like '78 and '86, without knowing it's a revolution in this country, just like recent years.  Like '08 and '09, we now have film movie makers not wanting to play in the shadow of high dollar films and old whigs.  Many of its films today sit on international film festivals and win 1st place. Paddy Considine wrote, &quot;Cinematic independence is doing lots of things we have failed to do&quot;.

It's a brilliant meditation on liberal denial.  The Beach also serves as something of a nostalgia fest for those of us born at the tail end of 'Generation X' and that includes Leonardo DiCaprio, the main star of The Beach.  Set just before 9,11 and before beheading Europeans wherever they could be found outside of the West became a trend, The Beach harks back to a time when middle class 'Gen Xers' could trot around the world in search of the 'authentic', away from the consumerist tedium of high capitalism which had reduced their own cultures to shopping malls and warehouse space.   Enlightenment and spiritual fulfilment, they believed, was to be found within the jungles of India, the beaches of Thailand or the ruined Archaeology of central American native tribes rather than the pay as you go Cathedrals of Europe or the beer belly and tattoo'd idiocy of the Spanish resort.
