Plasma temperature is commonly measured in kelvins or electronvolts and is , informally , a measure of the thermal kinetic energy per particle . High temperatures are usually needed to sustain ionization , which is

Prompt 4010:
Since plasmas are very good electrical conductors , electric potentials play an important role . The potential as it exists on average in the space between charged particles , independent of the question of how
